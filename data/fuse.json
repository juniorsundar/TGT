The beings did not have a visible form, not for the average mortal eyes at least. Amidst the void-black backdrop, their presence was momentary and infinite, all-encompassing and miniscule. They were juxtaposition manifest.\n\n{I didn't think you would come here, Mast,} the first being commended with an intonation implying cheer. {Did you finally grow tired of your human?}\n\n(On the contrary,) the other being responded with a recreation of mirth in their voice. (Everything is moving according to my plan, barring a few unpleasant deviances. However, I expect the end result to match my initial estimates. It seems that you have taken a truly hands-off approach with yours?)\n\n{Oy...} the first being emulated a sigh. {I think I made a mistake. I should have vetted my human prior to bringing him here.}\n\n(That's exactly what I told you to do. Look at me, I ran simulations over simulations with my human prior to migrating him to this world.)\n\n{I thought it didn't matter. Tron groaned that his world wasn't moving forward as quickly as he'd hoped. I figured if I brought a mortal from my world, which has advanced to a significantly higher degree, it would help move his world's progression as well,} the being whined in response.\n\nTo that, Mast released a tutting noise, which was miraculous given how the beings lacked the muscle and bone for it. (That's where you are wrong my little sister Moni. You evaluate these mortals from a lens of non-conforming entities such as ourselves. Mortals are notorious for their selfish desire for self-fulfilment above others. They do not follow common logic unless they are given proper motivation to do so.)\n\n{That's exactly what I did!} Moni retorted dramatically. {To provide by human with the proper drive, I even formulated certain achievements as 'Missions' according to those digital entertainment platforms they call games. I took your advise and implemented positive and negative reinforcement, yet the man consistently misconstrued my instructions and took it to destructive extremes.}\n\n(Give me an example,) Mast declared.\n\n{Well, there was an instance where I probed my human to motivate an audience to research new avenues for alchemical products. However, instead of taking the constructive route to recruit the group and ushering them forward together, the man took the least optimum approach of antagonising the leader of the audience and thoroughly humiliating him. How does that help in boosting the advancement of civilisation?} Moni berated exasperatedly. {Why is it that your human is generating greater advancements while mine is stagnating?}\n\n(The issue is in the selection of the mortal, Moni,) Mast narrated. (The human you picked perceived himself to be living an unfulfilled life. He probably had hopes and expectations that he failed to accomplish in his previous life which he is now projecting into this new life, and is overcompensating in the process. Furthermore, the human you picked probably thinks that he is the one that is the centre of focus in this world - in other words he must feel entitled?)\n\n{Right you are!}\n\n(My human is the exact opposite. He had very few hopes and dreams, but had access to anything he could want. Through my observations, I have found that it is often easier to turn a passive mortal to be more active in their life than to achieve the opposite. You must be tired of trying to leash your mortal, correct?)\n\n{Yes...}\n\n(Apart from that, I have other factors in play that are tilting things in my favour. The pawn I selected was vetted through innumerable levels and is the only one from my world that matched all my required criteria. He has a reason to stay in this world, vis-a-vis a mortal who is a fascimile of another mortal from his past life who he failed to consummate his emotional longing with. He has a reason to help improve this world, with all the younglings depending on him and egging his natural instinct to nurture.)\n\n{I mean... I didn't consider all those details. But the human I chose worked in a massive repository that stored a vast collection of knowledge from my world. Yet the man isn't even using it! That was his entire purpose of existence here!}\n\n(It is one thing to know, and another to teach. One without knowledge of a subject can still teach it if they have the capacity for it. Your human does not have the capacity to teach, he is far too self-absorbed and impatient. My human is trained and has ample experience in teaching. You forget that to implement lasting advancement in this world, a single entity is insufficient. Only by gradual propagation of knowledge can there be a lasting impact.)\n\n{You really did think this through, didn't you?}\n\n(Of course I did, it's the safety of my world that's at stake. Why would I not? The question is why aren't you taking this more seriously?)\n\nThere was silence.\n\n(I see... You intend to use my world as a buffer if this world falls.) Mast commented icily.\n\n{I-It's not like that.}\n\n(If this world falls, I will surrender my world,) Mast interjected.\n\n{What? Why?}\n\n(My allegiance is with Tron, not you. Your negligence will cost you dearly, Moni.)\n\n{You can't do that-}\n\nOnce again, her hysterical response was interjected by a sudden warp in the space. Visible only to higher-order perception, a third entity came into existence in the area.\n\n[This is where the two of you have been hiding?] A stern voice demanded. [What where you two thinking? Are you trying to further destabilise my already unstable world?]\n\n(On the contrary, we were trying to help you?)\n\n[How would that be? By bringing in two anomalies? If I didn't know that it was you two, I would have mistaken it for an invader! I hope you realise just how much your interference has cost me. My world was in the process of splitting into a multiverse because of what you two did. Do you know how difficult it is to maintain a multiversal world? Ask Oaa and their ilk - although it yields a large bounty it is equally difficult to tend to. Beings crossing between multiverses, redundancies and rampant quantum annihalation events, and worst of all time-travel!]\n\n{Sorry...}\n\n[For the first time, you aren't the one at fault,] Tron said with a human-like sigh. [Your interference has been assimilated into my world's sequence without much hassle. It is Mast's that is still threatening my world's stability. Moni, leave while I converse with this one.]\n\nWithout a moment lost, one of the beings escaped from the space. After their departure, silence took hold.\n\n[There is an issue with the being you brought in. No matter how much I try to integrate it into my world's sequence, it starts to deviate. I have to actively exert my influence to stop that from happening. What are you trying to do?] There was a threatening force in Tron's voice which caused the only other entity in the room to flinch.\n\n(I'm only trying to help,) Mast said with difficulty.\n\n[That is not how it looks from where I am standing.]\n\n(I apologise for shifting the blame, but this is partly your fault.)\n\n[WHAT?!] Tron evoked, causing the space to quake menacingly.\n\n(I did not expect the laws of this world to be so fragile. To borrow a mortal phrase, it is balancing at the tip of a needle. Much to my annoyance, it was sheer coincidence that has resulted in this issue. Your laws governing the nature of souls in this world is flimsy. All I did was provide a power derived from extraworldly energy, but it ended up interfering with a law that you set on how mortals can cultivate spirituality to augment their souls.)\n\n[So that's what it was...]\n\n(You're being uncharacteristically lax with your management of this world, Brother.)\n\n[It's not like I have a choice,] Tron answered bitterly. [My other world is at the brink of assimilation with the invading world builder, and I don't even know how they did it. They are intimated with my signature, they will know the location of this world soon. In fact, they already do! There was a preliminary probe attacking this world a while back. I had to crack down on the laws governing spatial anomalies at great personal costs. I need the mortals of my world to become stronger to stand a chance against the invader, since the invader's attacks are highly unconventional.]\n\n(Which is why I brought in this mortal. Is he not showing results?)\n\n[He is,] Tron admitted. [If not for the frequent destabilising events, I would personally commend your decision.]\n\n(It only happens when the mortal tries to manifest the power drawn from extraworldly energy, right?)\n\n[That is correct.]\n\n(Stop trying to actively integrate my mortal into your world's sequence.)\n\n[But that will cause my world to split!]\n\n(Only do so in the short term. Treat the mortal as a singularity, whose state is only verifiable within immediate vicinity of their existence,) Mast suggested.\n\n[That will introduce innumerable uncertainties in the determination of a stable timeline. What you're asking me to do is to treat this mortal as the focal point of my world?] Tron responded in disbelief. [You ask for me to put all of my faith in this mortal?]\n\n(We are multidimensional entities, faith is a mortal emotion,) Mast answered with an emulated chuckle.\n\n[Our kind persists that we are different from the mortals that roam our worlds, yet we all succumb to the same fear of demise. Ironic, isn't it?] Tron commented. [I hastily created this world to escape demise, something any other mortal would do - clinging onto a faint thread of hope that can offer some solace of survival or retribution. Once this world falls, which is my conclusion based on current trends, what will you do?]\n\n(If this world is assimilated, I will surrender,) Mast confessed.\n\n[Just like that?]\n\n(I exist because you took me under your protection. You helped me stabilise my world, and taught me everything. If I cannot repay that favour by saving you from the danger that threatens you, then what is my reason of existence? To approach this from a rational point of view: If your world falls, there is little I can do to stop mine from following down the same path anyways.)\n\n[Does Moni share the same opinion?]\n\n(Moni's opinion and decision are irrelevant. You should be able to gauge her perspective after observing the impact of her interference in your world. Moni's mortal has accomplished nothing and has done little to progress your world.)\n\nAnother bout of silence reigned in the void-black space.\n\n[Share your plan with me. I do not like being kept in the dark in matters concerning my own world. Tell me everything there is to know about this mortal named Guy.]\n\n(I shall do so,) Mast responded with a monotonous drone.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-215]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":3,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 213 - Start of an Unexpected Journey","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nThe sight within Marie's core matched the descriptions from Krish's records. A world, the entire cosmos encompassing everything observed and unobserved, compressed into a tiny and immaterial space within Marie's soul. Every aspect of the world was connected, with threads of gold forming a net tethering everything into one intricate tapestry. The fact that everything was within Krish's expectations indicated that in its core, Marie's cultivation had not deviated - she was still a practitioner of the Heavenly Eye.\n\nHowever, a difference started to manifest itself within the very next second, when a golden thread split off from the cosmos and attached to his hand. The thread pulsed as a wave was transmitted back into the cosmos. Then, before his very eyes, the cosmos started to change. Heavenly bodies were rearranged, removed, and added in real time. Once the rearrangement settled, he saw the cosmos shake unhappily and reset itself to the initial state. Then the pulse repeated once again, reiterating through the 'rearrange, remove and add' cycle to a new configuration only to disintegrate and reset after an unhappy shake.\n\nIt looked as though the world was trying to make sense of his existence, but was failing miserably to do so. This should not be the case because, after all, Krish was supposed to be detached from fate - an observer.\n\nThe iterative cycle repeated for a hundred tries, each more intriguing than the next. There were unique and novel configurations of the universe Krish could never dream of - one in particular had all the stars in space congregated into a single massive ball of fire with heavenly bodies orbiting at a manic speed around it.\n\nAfter the hundredth repeat, the world shook angrily and started a new approach. Since it could not accommodate him into its tapestry, it was time for him to change to fit in. With that, an attack was launched towards him that started to deconstruct his hand. Krish could anticipate where this was going and immediately retreated. His spiritual cultivation was strong enough to resist the attack, and then some.\n\nBefore Krish exited his Disciple's core space he took a few seconds to summarise his observations. Her cultivation wasn't exactly as it was supposed to be. While the overaching nature of her cultivation was similar, there were minor differences here and there that set it apart, making it more personal to his Disciple. Was this a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nFor one, it meant that her path to advancement was no longer laid out as descriptively; quite possibly, she could no longer go through the same steps as he had to advance in her cultivation. This could be disadvantageous, since uncertainty came with risks. On the other hand, this also meant that there was room for improvement in the Heavenly Eye, a cultivation method which had stagnated for many millennia.\n\nNonetheless, as he exited his Disciple's core, he wore a concerned demeanour truthful to his opinion.\n\n\"So there is good news and bad news,\" Krish started to say, but he was immediately interrupted by Marie with an immediate declaration.\n\n\"I know what I need to do,\" Marie spoke with conviction. \"The way to advance safely - I know what to do!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Krish probed.\n\n\"I need to model the world,\" Marie answered, though Krish didn't understand her meaning.\n\n\"Just like how other cultivation methods use the movement of planetary bodies to divine the future, I must do the same. However, it needs to be accurate and dynamic not the snapshot-method everyone else uses. It needs to be responsive to changes as they transpire and must correct itself in real0-time,\" Marie elaborated. \"Thus I need to devise a strategy to, and successfully model the world.\"\n\n\"And how will you go about doing that?\" Krish probed.\n\n\"System identification,\" Marie responded. \"We collate data sets and compare against existing models of the cosmos and optimise it. It is an iterative process. Although...\"\n\n\"Although, what?\" Krish urged.\n\nWith a bitter smile, \"To do that, I will need a large data set of movement of heavenly bodies and so on. And it needs to be precise and accurate for my model to be correct.\"\n\n\"Why would that be an issue?\" Krish asked with a tilt of his head.\n\n\"Well it's not like there's an observatory just floating around here,\" Marie snorted sarcastically, only to receive a proud smirk from Krish.\n\n\"Maybe not here,\" Krish said mysteriously. He then lowered his gaze and pondered over his next move. After a quick minute, he said, \"Pack up your things. We will be leaving tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Leaving? Where?\" Marie shot back.\n\n\"We will be going on a trip to fetch the information you need,\" Krish explained. \"I hope you can explain this to the Matron,\" he said to Guy. \"I don't wish to aggravate her... trauma.\"\n\nGuy nodded with a morose frown. He knew that Krish was observing everything happening around him, and the fact that he intruded in on Grace's confession did breach a few privacy laws. However, he was right in this regard. A male Master suddenly whisking away a female Disciple from her family might draw a lot of parallels with her own life experience, and she would need to be eased into it.\n\n\"I will handle things on my end,\" Guy responded. \"However I will need assurances.\"\n\n\"I don't think we will encounter anyone stronger than I,\" Krish said with a bemused smile. \"Besides that, she is my resposibility too. I am not going to rush her into trouble.\"\n\nGuy hummed contemplatively and in half affirmation. He recognised that the trip would be important for Marie to advance and he was all for it. He also had a good read on Krish and knew that the man only held good intentions for Marie. The issue, though, was getting Grace on board which he expected to be a steep uphill rise.\n\nContrary to Guy's expectations, it did not take much to convince Grace. To quote her exact words, \"Marie won't let the man get an inch near her if she doesn't want to.\"\n\nHer confidence in Marie was staggering. Then again, the girl had practically lived alone for most of her life with her work. And thus, with haste efficiency, the Master-Disciple duo were prepped up and ready to set off on their journey at the crack of dawn.\n\n____\n\n\"We didn't pack any food,\" Marie commented with an irate scowl.\n\n\"It's all part of the plan, my little Disciple,\" Krish answered with a mysterious intonation. Seeing as his Disciple wasn't in a mood for jokes, he added, \"It will be part of practice. When I started my journey with my Master, the only things we carried was a set of clothes and a canteen of water.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The aim is to acquire the required resources while travelling. It helps us put our abilities into practice,\" Krish answered. \"Hungry? We accumulate a favour with a commoner and fill our stomachs. Injured? We do the same with a healer and get treated. Every problem has an individual who can offer a solution.\"\n\n\"So we exploit their goodwill?\" Marie blurted out incredulously.\n\n\"Well, best case scenario would be that we anticipate encroaching danger and avoid it altogether, but if push comes to shove then yes,\" Krish nodded.\n\nMarie chuckled along with Krish as they exited the vicinity of the village.\n\n\"So where are we going?\" Marie probed.\n\n\"East,\" Krish answered.\n\n\"Please,\" Marie requested with oozing sarcasm. \"Please be vaguer.\"\n\n\"There is an island due North-East from here smack-dab in the middle of the Vast Blue Expanse. That is our destination,\" Krish expounded.\n\n\"Why are we going there exactly?\"\n\n\"Well, remember how I told you that a few of our ancestor have already tried to find alternatives and improve upon the Heavenly Eye? My Master's Master happened to be a part of that group, and happened to follow a similar line of reasoning such as yourself, barring the whole model part,\" Krish narrated. \"Therefore, he accumulated a few favours with an upstart Sect that practice an arcane body cultivation method that relies on tracking the movement of heavenly bodies.\"\n\n\"How does that work?\" Marie voiced her intrigue.\n\n\"You can ask them when we get there. Any way it's not our concern. What matters to us is that they've aggregated highly accurate and precise records of the movement of heavenly bodies for at least the last two millennia.\"\n\n\"How are you so sure that they wouldn't have gone extinct by now? A lot of time has passed, after all,\" Marie responded dubiously.\n\n\"I've checked,\" Krish responded. \"They're still up and running. My Grandmaster was thorough in his intervention, do not think that we are half-hearted in our assistance just because we callously provide it for out own benefit.\"\n\n\"Do you think I will succeed, Master?\" Marie voiced her uncertainty. Although she exuded an air of confidence when she declared her resolve to create a dynamic model of the world, she was still just a teenage youth stepping into the vast expanse of cultivation. She was filled with worry and uneasiness.\n\n\"I have confidence in you,\" Krish hummed. \"You achieved something that generations of our ancestors deemed impossible. Therefore, my confidence in you isn't insincere. You have proven time and time again that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.\"\n\n\"Know this, it is my duty as your Master to support you through everything. Even if this venture does not pan out as you expect it to, worry not. Everything will work out as it is supposed to, you just do what you deem necessary,\" Krish added.\n\n\"It will all work out eventually,\" Marie parroted. \"I am fated with the Heavenly Eye, after all,\" she said with a chuckle.\n\nKrish's stopped in place and looked at his Disciple's cheeky grin. After a second, he joined her in her mirthful laugh and continued in their journey.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-214]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 212 - Second Perfected Resonance","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nKrish immediately honed his senses and observed the cultivation of his Disciple. His mien warped into a concerned frown as the significance of Marie's transformation dawned upon him. Needless to say, in his thousand years, and in the records left behind by his ancestors, he was yet to observe a person undergoing a second perfected resonance... successfully. THAT was the key word which brought an endless barrage of anxiety.\n\nPerfected resonance is a sign that a cultivator's practised cultivation method resonates with their will - in other words it is deemed compatible with them. A single cultivator may have multiple resonating cultivation methods, but they usually opt for one to take to the end of their journey. Once they achieve perfected resonance with one cultivation method, it is akin to pouring hardening stone mixture and structural supporst and letting things cure. The only thing possible now is to build upon these supports and creating an intricate and vast, metaphorical house. To achieve a second perfected resonance should be impossible, on paper.\n\nThere have been cases where a mage underwent a successive perfected resonance after practising another cultivation method that resonated with them previously. The mage hoped to amplify their initial advantage by possibly dual-classing - an intuitive decision. The result, as expected, was the complete shattering of their nascent core and gruesome demise due to explosion. Krish could confirm, with an unshakeable degree of certainty, that it was nigh impossible to succeed with a second perfected resonance.\n\nThis was why his countenance grew dourer with each passing second as the minor whirlpool of mana siphoned into his Disciple. Using his mana sense, he observed her cultivation as best as he could without interrupting her - since interrupting a perfected resonance would cause equal harm. Through his observations, he noticed something unfathomable transpiring within his Disciple. Well, calling it unfathomable would be incorrect since he had seen it once before - with Markus. Essentially, Krish could see his Disciple's cultivation being handled like a piece of elastic parchment, if that even was a thing. Her cemented concepts were being stretched, compressed and reshaped in real-time. Parts were being trimmed while in other places additions were underway. Certain sections were cut and then stitched back in other locations. All in all, controlled chaos reigned within his Disicple's nascent core.\n\nIt distressed Krish further since he could not keep track, or make any sense, of what his Disciple was actually going through. All he could hope was for her to come out the other side in one piece so that he could salvage what remained. At this moment, he regretted letting the girl experiment around with things beyond her control. He regretted indulging her arcane whims and fancies. He regretted everything!\n\n'What fuelled his regret?' His mind paused to wonder. Was it objective - because he was losing a Disciple after years of waddling around without one? Or was it drenched in a coating of subjective emotion - because he was truly fond of his new Disciple and hated for her to suffer?\n\nThough he hated to admit it, Krish was sure that it was probably the latter of the two reasons. Marie had grown on him, beyond his expectations. Through her constant egging and contention, she had somehow carved a place for herself in his heart. He was starting to care for the girl, and it was petrifying.\n\nSome say love is the death of duty, but Krish knew that the parasite called love - in whatever for it may come be it romantic, familial, or friendship - was just death. This was especially true for a mage, since attachments bred weaknesses. This was partly why many cultivation sects of yore distanced their members from earthly connections. Since an opponent could exploit a weakness by simply threatening a loved one.\n\nKrish's eyes darted to his dessicated leg at that instant. If nothing else, this withered husk of an appendage was a small preview of what the weakness called love would lead to. Heck, now that he thought about it, he was just as prepared to sacrifice another part of himself, albeit a negligible one, to let his student advance into Foundation Establishment realm!\n\nThough this begged the question, if this second perfected resonance failed, would he be willing to sacrifice something more for his Disciple's sake?\n\nThe answer of course was 'Of course not... yet!' His eyes widened with a startle as that declaration formed in his mind. Yet implied he would be willing to do so in the future! His heart had betrayed him once again.\n\nThe agitation stemming from the conclusion of his emotional dilemma, conjoined with the distress over his Disciple's currently uncertain future had completely drained Krish of his energy and rationality. The two harrowing thoughts had overtaken his mental capacities and rendered him immobile and paralysed. All he could do now was wait and watch.\n\nIn Krish's perspective, time decelerated to a slow crawl, yet in truth the entire process of Marie's second perfected resonance barely lasted ten minutes. However, one must note that it was admittedly longer than what a usual perfected resonance would last for.\n\n____\n\nOnce Marie and Guy exited the Church after a productive virtual venture, they were immediately greeted by the downtrodden figure of Krish. Due to their ignorance of the man's revolutionary emotional journey within the past ten minutes, they couldn't acertain the cause of his current state.\n\n\"H-How are you feeling?\" Krish asked with a shaking voice and an equally shaking hand.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Marie responded casually.\n\n\"Do you feel any different? Don't be hasty and check your core - try to circulate your mana through it,\" Krish instructed.\n\nMarie scrunched her nose in confusion and proceeded to follow her Master's instructions. As she did so, her expression starting fluctuate between bewilderment and pleasurable excitement.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Krish asked hastily.\n\n\"I-It's hard to explain. It feels different from before that's for sure,\" Marie pointed out. \"But I suddenly feel more... saturated. Not bloated, just saturated. Do you get what I mean?\"\n\n\"That should be expected, given how you've just gone through a perfected resonance. Your core must be practically bursting with mana,\" Krish affirmed.\n\n\"It's been some time though, why the delay?\" Marie asked back while tilting her head.\n\n\"You misunderstand,\" Krish responded while shaking his head gravely. \"You just underwent another perfected resonance.\"\n\nThe revelation came as a bombshell for both Marie and Guy, \"What? HOW?!\" Guy evoked.\n\n\"That shouldn't be possible,\" Marie muttered. It was in her nature to understand what she was getting into thoroughly. To that end, she was intimate with perfected resonance as a phenomenon.\n\n\"That's what I believed,\" Krish responded. \"Until now. You are the first to do so, hence you must understand my incredulity and concern. I need to make sure that you are safe, you are my Disciple after all.\"\n\n\"What must be done?\" Guy answered in Marie's stead in haste.\n\n\"I will need to inspect her cultivation, much like how Mage Jeeves has done before. I will need your permission, my Disciple,\" Krish asked.\n\nMarie nodded in affirmation without hesitation. As she did so, she started to approach Krish.\n\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Krish halted her. \"I can do it from here.\"\n\nKrish closed his eyes and directed his full attention to Marie's core. With practised efficiency, he was now present inside her core space. Compared to Al, his spiritual cultivation was many levels ahead. It was so advanced that he did not need to physically contact the person's whose cultivation he wanted to inspect. On a side note, in the Tesseract Transformation realm, spiritual attacks are another branch of offensive magic that one needs to protect themselves again. A Tesseract Transformation mage can effortlessly destroy an opposing mage's cultivation without moving a muscle.\n\nAlthough, Krish's current venture wasn't to hurt anyone rather to ensure that his Disciple's cultivation was safe. The core space is a semi-manifestation of what a mage's cultivation entails. Krish was knowledgeable about what a Heavenly Eye practitioner's core space looks like. They have been etched into the records he carried with him, passed down from his ancestor. After entering Marie's space, he could confirm was that his Disciple's did not match it at all.\n\nThe room existed, and did not exist. This was the best description Krish could come up with. The space twitched frantically after his presence was made known. Although Marie had allowed his access, the space did not like it that a character with proper dimensionality and form had encroached its domain. With every passing second, a discomfited wave washed over Krish that implemented a change in his form, abstracting it. But after determining that the change was faulty it would revert. Only to repeat once again.\n\nKrish moved his gaze accross the area and immediately noticed a small congregation of liquid at the centre, which he correctly asssumed to be Marie's nascent core. To truly confirm the nature of his Disciple's cultivation, he would need to intrude in there.\n\nWith cautious steps, Krish moved forward, or did the room move backwards? Krish could neither confirm nor deny it. No matter, the distance between the liquid body and his form was shortening. After he was in close-proximity, Krish lowered himself, or did the floor rise? Again, neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nKrish brought his head close to the liquid body and dunked it in. He did not feel as though he was breaching a liquid surface, but he could confirm that his face had entered a different space. At this moment, Krish took a second to release a light chuckle as he likened his current pose to Al's.\n\n\"I hope nothing weird happens,\" Krish muttered. But his smile faltered and compressed. \"I should probably prepare myself for the worst. Complacency will get me killed. And I don't want to get rescued by Guy...\"\n\nKrish opened his eyes and absorbed the magnificent visual presented before him. \"Now this is familiar!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-213]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":5,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 211 - Deterministic Chaos","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nMarie narrowed her eyes and gave her Master an affronted look.\n\n\"Why are you doing this, Master?\" She blurted out exasperatedly.\n\n\"Doing what?\"\n\nMarie pointed downwards aggressively and waved her hands around her right after as she repeated, \"This! A week. I spent an entire week coming up with a solution, even an inkling of it, and finally gained some headway. But then you stumble along and just slap it away?\"\n\n\"I'm just trying to help...\" Krish muttered. \"Isn't it better to not have to go through a pointless path that leads to a dead end.\"\n\nUnbridled rage flashed across Marie's eyes, which started to radiate outwards, \"How do you know it will be a dead end? Have you tried exploring it?\"\n\n\"Well not personally,\" Krish shrugged. \"My Master's Master did, though. I heard from my Master that it was a wasted effort. His Master spent five years trying to find a viable connection between the contemporary seer arts and the Heavenly Eye.\"\n\n\"So its hearsay?\" Marie reiterated.\n\n\"It's not hearsay,\" her Master said with a stern retort. \"I heard it from my Master, who learned from his.\"\n\n\"Yet there are no written records of this experiment,\" Marie pointed out. \"What were the testing criteria, what was the methodology? Without answering these questions, and evaluating the evidence, how can I just trust this claim?\"\n\n\"I am your Master,\" Krish warned.\n\n\"And I am your Disciple, you should know the kind of person I am,\" Marie shot back with equal ferocity. \"And here I thought we were getting closer,\" she muttered disappointedly.\n\nKrish sighed audible and inquired, \"I was only trying to help. I just...\"\n\nIn truth, Krish was feeling left out. For the past few weeks, due to Guy's absence, he got to spend more time with his Disciple and perform his duties as a Master more extensively. He even got the opportunity to teach his Disciple some spells and magical theory. Although he was the one who preempted Guy's trip for his student's sake, he felt a little jealous after observing the two working together so cohesively. He could see that the two shared the same wavelength, something he'd been trying to achieve with his Disciple through excruciating amount of effort. Now that he thought about it, Guy had this uncanny ability to connect with any child taught. The man could shift his approach like a chameleon - it was a skill Krish sorely desired nowadays.\n\n\"This isn't helping,\" Marie responded solemnly, noticing the drop in her Master's expression. She wasn't an expert in reading body language and intent, but she could at least glean that her Master's current demeanour had more to do with himself than with her. He was being petty, completely unlike himself.\n\n\"Besides,\" Marie added. \"It's decided! Even if your Master's Master failed, I won't. I will MAKE SURE that I succeed, even if it is the last thing I do.\"\n\n\"But how?\" Krish asked.\n\n\"We'll find a way,\" she answered. \"We managed to come this far, let's see how much further we can go.\"\n\nWith that said, Marie skipped towards the blackboards and started to jot down hypotheses as they popped into her head. Her mind was whirring constantly, forming connections and disconnecting pointless avenues at inhuman speeds. At a point, her hands could not keep up with her thoughts, and they started to visibly stutter in place.\n\nAs Marie worked on the boards, Krish approached Guy and asked with a low whisper, \"How do you do it?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" What Guy's knee-jerk response as he remained distracted by the convoluted mess being manifested on the board.\n\n\"Mesh with her so easily? I am yet to observe a single adversarial interaction between you and Marie. In fact, I am yet to observe such an interaction between you and ANY of your students,\" Krish inquired with a hesitating and ashamed tone.\n\n\"The answer is right in front of you,\" Guy pointed out. \"Marie is driven and intelligent when approaching topics she is informed about, and she is humble and deferring when it comes to topics she isn't so knowledgeable about. All you need to do is show her a path, and she will explore it to its entirety. What you did earlier was place a blockage in her path. In doing so, you intruded into her natural process and pushed her to do the exact opposite - since it is in her nature to be a contrarian.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm stuck again,\" Marie declared as she stepped back with a pensieve look.\n\nGuy mouthed, 'See what I mean?' to Krish as he approached his struggling student. \"Where's the issue now?\"\n\n\"It all feels like a cohesive system,\" Marie commented. \"The other cultivation methods use astrological positions as some sort of initial conditions that can be used to predict the state of the system in the future. However, what if there is an error in the initial state estimate? Is this why the other methods are inaccurate?\"\n\nAs Guy absorbed Marie's words, an idea started to bloom in his mind. The whole explanation and her diagrammatic representation on the blackboard started to tug at a long forgotten memory of his from his past life. He'd read of something like this before.\n\n\"Chaos theory...\" Guy muttered. Although it wasn't explicitly stated on the board, Guy could make the connection to it.\n\n\"What's that?\" Marie asked with an intrigued expression.\n\nGuy's smile twitched. He knew what it was, or had a recollection of an example of chaos theory, but he could not formalise it with a definition - at least not with a definition Marie would be satisfied with. After pausing to think, Guy decided to make use of a resource accessible to him. \"I believe it will be easier to just show you what I mean.\"\n\nMarie's eyes shone with a cognisant lustre, and she nodded affirmatively. Krish could read between the line and immediately knew that Guy was about to perform his brand of |Soul Imprint|. He frowned bitterly since he could not follow his Disciple in her adventure.\n\nFor the other two, entering the Church was a familiar and trivial task. Guy had perfected it through repeated use and Marie had got used to the disorienting sensation that deposited her into the ethereal chapel. With another set of practised motion, Guy brought for the void-black screen hovering in front of the alter and pulled Marie's consciousness into it.\n\nGuy followed a minimalistic approach this time, opting for a simple cubed room with white all around. Without distracting details assaulting the senses, Guy could immerse Marie to what he was about to show. With a snap of his fingers, a rope dropped from the ceiling and a heavy circular mass attached itself at the free end - it was a simple pendulum.\n\n\"You should have seen a pendulum before, played around with it even. When you displace the pendulum's mass - the bob - from its rest position by a little and then release it, you can observe a familiar reaction of it oscillating. If we were to plot the pendulum's displacement from the centre, we receive a waveform with is a simple sinusoid,\" as Guy narrated, a moving graph appeared to his side with a black line snaking up and down, above and below the time-axis as the pendulum oscillated back and forth.\n\n\"Note that no matter where you release it from,\" Guy explained as he stopped the pendulum and raised it to a slightly higher starting point, \"the resulting behaviour of the pendulum is predictable, as you can see a similarly shaped graph forming.\"\n\n\"This is a property of linear systems. As long as this pendulum's initial displacement angle isn't too egregious, the resulting behaviour is predictable.\"\n\nGuy then snapped his fingers and caused another rope and bob to attach itself from the existing bob, \"This is a double pendulum. I have tightened the strings so that they neither compress or extend - they can be likened to rods. This is a nonlinear system.\"\n\nGuy pulled back the lower pendulum, and released it. \"This time, we will plot the displacement of the lower bob only. Observe at its irregular behaviour. A nonlinear system is one where the change in output is not proportional to the change of its input. That is, if I displace the lower bob by a little, and if it were a linear system, I should expect a proportional increase in the outputs magnitude, however that isn't the case as seen in this graph.\"\n\nOn the graph in question, there were wild peaks and troughs forming in seemingly random shape. \"Now you would think that nonlinear systems are unpredictable, but that is not true since I am graphing it for you here. As long as the model of the system is known, we can plot the behaviour of the nonlinear system like a linear one. The key difference that I want to point out here is as follow.\"\n\nGuy clapped his hands and pulled them outwards. In doing so, the double pendulums multiplied; there were now ten identical double pendulums hanging off of the ceiling.\n\n\"I am now going to pull the lower bob back by the same amount for all ten, however before releasing them, I am going to slightly - by a negligible amount - change their displacement,\" as he finished, Guy released all the bobs together.\n\n\"Nonlinear systems are chaotic, but also predictable. They are predictable as mentioned before as long as we know their model. They are chaotic because just knowing their present behaviour does not determine their future behaviour.\"\n\nThe ten graphs were displaying similar behaviour, with the same peaks and troughs. However, somewhere around the four-second mark, a small change started to materialise, the graphs started to deviate from each other. Guy let the graphs progress for a while longer before bringing them all together in the same set of axes. In doing so, Marie was able to clearly see how, while the graphs were similar in the beginning, they started to differ wildly near the later stage and, after a certain point, failed to look anything like each other at all.\n\n\"A small change in initial condition of a nonlinear system can elicit unpredictable changes in the system's expected behaviour in the future, just like how a butterfly's wingbeat can cause a typhoon on the other end of the planet.\" Guy coughed mirthfully before adding, \"That last part was just an idiom, of course.\"\n\nMarie's eyes narrowed at the graph presented before her, \"The world is a nonlinear system... Having the incorrect initial conditions causes massive deviations. These deviations represent the Transients. But this should lead to instability... unless...\"\n\nSuddenly, Marie snapped her fingers as a breakthrough hit her. She rushed towards the graph and with her fingers, pinched the ten graphs at the twenty-second mark where they had completely deviated from each other. \"Constant events are fixed in the tapestry of fate. They exist to ensure that a butterfly's wingbeat doesn't elicit a tropical storm. This is it! As long as I can model fate, I can find the constants at the points where each of the parallel transient behaviours of the universe merge into one.\"\n\nThe location were Marie pinched the graphs started to shine with a golden hue, as a bounteous change took place inside her.\n\n____\n\nNot half an hour passed by, before Krish was brought out of his sulking and bore witness to something that had never happened before, at least not successfully, in the history of cultivation. His dearest Disciple was undergoing another perfected resonance!\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-212]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":6,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 210 - Alternative to the Heavenly Eye","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nAlthough Guy enjoyed indulging his student's requests and teaching, he recognised the disrespect in the act of intruding into the territory of a Master and Disciple. Although this wasn't his first time aiding Marie in her cultivation, he didn't want this to become a regular event. After all, it was a bad sign if the Disciple of another approached him with all of her cultivation hang-ups. Therefore, the first thing he did after waking up was to approach Krish's cottage and get his permission.\n\nHowever, before he could take a step out the orphanage, the answer he sought was delivered directly into his head. \"You can go ahead and ease her troubles.\"\n\nIt was Krish's voice through transmission. Since Guy didn't have the same range, he had to speak out loud to seemingly no one in particular, like a mad-man.\n\n\"I don't know how to do it though. Again, I am not informed about the Heavenly Eye in any way whatsoever. Furthermore, I am aware that revealing any sensitive information can result in calamitious consequences. Are you sure that you want me to get involved in this?\" Guy asked\n\n\"I trust Marie to differentiate between the knowledge that can and cannot be shared. She is a cautious and mature girl. She is just stuck right now and need some guidance to nudge her in a direction that can yield some form of result. It doesn't have to be successful, as long as she feels like she has achieved something meaningful.\"\n\nGuy hummed in contemplation and inquired, \"What exactly is she trying to do?\"\n\n\"I will leave her to answer that question. You should prepare yourself, she is approaching you... Now!\"\n\n\"Mister Larks!\" Marie greeted from behind him.\n\n\"Marie, good morning.\"\n\n\"I don't know if its good just yet,\" Marie snorted. \"Can we continue where we left off from yesterday?\"\n\n\"I was waiting for you, after all,\" Guy said with a smile.\n\nGuy ushered Marie into the classroom and urged her to explain her trouble coherently while utilising the blackboard to augment her retelling. He recollected from yesterday that there were multiple moving parts and details that were important which sort of rushed past him. And by the time Marie finished presenting her piece, two blackboards had been filled up with intricate diagrams, key phrases, propositions, hypotheses and rogue thoughts.\n\n\"That's where I'm stuck,\" Marie said with a defeated sigh. \"I have no idea where to go with this. There is literally nothing I can do here!\"\n\nMarie's shoulder drooped with visible exhaustion, but it immediately perked up as her gaze gained a bright shimmer. She looked eagerly towards Guy. To her, Guy was akin to a great big bird who would swoop down and save her whenever she was stuck. Her tendency to rely on Guy had grown marginally within the last year, which was a good sign. It indicated that Marie was slowly letting go of the metaphorical weights that bore down on her shoulders. But it also put Guy in a difficult position, since he felt more and more pressured with each problem of hers as they grew in complexity. Maybe this was how parents felt as their kids grew older and the world moved forward while leaving them behind. Sometimes, Guy just didn't know what to do... If this were any other student of his, he would easily just tell them that he didn't know and guide them through possible research avenues. But when facing Marie's worshipping and admiring gaze, Guy just couldn't vocalise his ineptitude.\n\nGuy scratched his chin as he scrambled for a feasible starting point - any detail he could grasp at and possible build upon.\n\n\"Just to confirm, as long as your observation of these 'Constants' is not through your Heavenly Eye, you will be safe? Have you confirmed that claim?\"\n\n\"We have reason to believe so. I mean, there hasn't been a set precedent, but circumstances suggest that it may be the case,\" Marie reaffirmed. Guy could see that she was holding back some details, but he could figure out that they maybe secrets related to her cultivation method.\n\n\"Have you considered how other cultivators specialising in divination and future sight tune their powers?\" Guy inquired.\n\n\"No I haven't,\" Marie answered with some uncertainty.\n\n\"Why is that? You were struggling to find resources. Well, what about them?\"\n\n\"They aren't as accurate as the Heavenly Eye,\" Marie argued.\n\n\"But they work, don't they?\" Guy argued back. \"Even if the margin of error with them is greater, they offer a solution - something you sorely need.\"\n\nMarie's lips parted and as she failed to come up with a response. In truth, this idea did pass her mind before but she didn't go through with it because-\n\n\"Arrogance,\" Guy declared. \"Every piece of knowledge which is sufficiently substantiated has truth to it.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Marie accepted with a defeated smiled. \"I was being conceited.\"\n\n\"Your Master is probably to blame,\" Guy blurted out, only to receive a sarcastic scoff directly transmitted into his head. He bit his tongue apologetically. \"The people you worry about competing against - those that have lived for millenia each - they are all cut from the same cloth. They have the same prejudices and biases. The arrogance that was building up inside you probably accumulated inside them as well. What you have in those records your Master showed you is an echo-chamber in written format. Everyone is just accepting and repeating what others have written before them.\"\n\nGuy leaned forward and said, \"The first step to solving the puzzle in front of you is, like always, accumulating more perspectives even if it isn't optimal. Since I have a week or so of free time before the builders get here, we shall conduct the research work together.\"\n\nMarie nodded appreciatively, but then her gaze mellowed, \"I don't think Master has any cultivation manuals of other divination or farsight based cultivation paths.\"\n\nTo that, Guy revealed a proud smirk and said, \"That's not an issue. I remember reading through a bunch of them back in the Academy. I just have to transcribe them.\"\n\n\"You remember them by heart?\" Marie exclaimed in shock.\n\nGuy tapped the side of his head and spoke mysteriously, \"My head is a steel trap, once I read a book I never forget it. There is literally a Repository of Knowledge in there.\"\n\n____\n\nGuy was never a fan of the myriad of cultivation manuals catching metaphorical dust in his Repository of Knowledge. Not only were they remnants of an unpleasant past of his after coming to this world as evidence of his failure, they were also a massive headache to decipher. Cultivation manuals had a penchant for dramatics and tended to obscure the teachings with cryptic and often unintelligible drivel - in Guy's point of view. However, he was pleasantly surprised to see Marie sharing his opinion though for a completely different reason.\n\n\"There aren't any evidence or theories to back it up. Are we just supposed to believe them as is - take them for their word?\" She argued as she slammed the manual onto the desk with an annoyed huff. For the past three days, Guy and Marie had gone through the cultivation manuals pertaining to divination and futuresight from both Guy's repository of knowledge and from a quick scouring of Krish's and Al's personal libraries. There were a substantial amount to go through, but with division of labour things progressed smoothly... in the beginning. After the first two manuals, both Guy and Marie started to exhibit outward irritation over their contents.\n\n\"Since you have a Master to train you and indulge in your inquiries, you have it easy. Back at the Academy, you had to make do with these manuals,\" Guy explained. \"The main reason why most students fail to advance in the Academy is BECAUSE they cannot decipher this garbage, and noone really goes out of their way to help unless the student shows some promise.\"\n\n\"Markus must have had it tough, uh?\" Marie commented, to which Guy affirmed with a hum.\n\n\"That's it, I can't take this any more,\" Marie declared while throwing her hands in the air. \"They're all the same. They just move words around, use alternate phrasing, play with semantics and vocabulary...\"\n\n\"How are they the same?\" Guy targeted. \"Be more analytical.\"\n\n\"Well, they all revolve around the motion or organisation of inter- or extraplanetary bodies,\" Marie explained. She then spread her hands between two distinct stacks of books next to her and added, \"This stack of manuals focuses on constellation arrangements, star clusters and so on, while this stack focuses on the planetary bodies within our solar system.\"\n\n\"Now since we know for a fact that these cultivation methods are effective and CAN be used for futuresight, our goal is to determine how and why, and the bridge the gap between them and the Heavenly Eye,\" Guy laid out.\n\n\"If I approach the reasoning from the other way: the Heavenly Eye directly gazes at the waves of fate, which is a fundamental law that governs the world. Waves of fate affect everything in and around us,\" Marie started.\n\nShe then cradled her chin on her hand and hummed loudly while her mind ran through hypotheses. After an audible fifteen minutes, she opened her mouth and orated steadily, \"The Heavenly Eye can gaze directly into the waves of fate, however those not pracitising cannot do so. In order to make up for this disadvantage, the contemporary seers utilise the behaviour of massive bodies as indicators. This is because the planets hold a greater influence in the grand scheme of things.\"\n\n\"Elaborate,\" Guy urged.\n\n\"Well, if you perform an action, the magnitude of the wave is negligible compared to if a planet suddenly shifts its orbital trajectory. Your singular action may not create large ripples in fate's machinations, but a planetary sized change might!\" Marie spoke with vigour and her eyes started to sparkle. She was nearing a conclusion and she was getting agitated at that prospect.\n\n\"So, there you have it,\" Guy beat her to the punch. \"Your solution to the alternative to the Heavenly Eye.\"\n\n\"But will it be effective?\" Marie muttered out loud.\n\n\"Not quite,\" a voice answered. A series of measured clacks of wood against the ground followed as it approached their position. Marie immediately recognised her Master's voice and readied a seat for him in anticipation.\n\n\"The books in front of you are evidence of the fact that they aren't as accurate as the Heavenly Eye is deciphering the future. I don't believe it will be possible,\" Krish said with an unsure frown as he entered the classroom.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-211]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":7,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 209 - Contesting the Ancestors","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nSome things are easier said than done. Giving a cat a bath. Getting over a tragic breakup. Overthinking situations. Amongst that exhaustive list of items, Marie was prepared to add another, which was coming up with an alternative to using the Heavenly Eye. It had been a good few weeks since she'd declared to her Master that she would find a way to bypass the Heavenly Eye and observe Constants. Yet, till now, she had made little to no progress in that front.\n\nFor one, the field of research was extremely restrictive. The only people she could refer to, and the only references she could access were by those who themselves were practitioners of the Heavenly Eye. And since at any point in time, only two practitioners can exist, she could only confer with her Master and with the extremely scarce stack of books he carried with him that were written by the practitioners before him. This brought on the second reason: Marie found out that research and advancement in the Heavenly Eye had stagnated three generations ago. One could only assume that her predecessors thought this was as far as they could take this cultivation method.\n\nThis discouraged and demotivated Marie for two reasons. One, she had very few people to discuss, debate and bounce her ideas off of. Marie was someone who thrived when there was an open conversation about a topic. She liked to float her ideas in a forum, gain a wide range of opinions before cementing her own which she would then take to her grave until sufficient evidence to refute it was brought to light. The nature of her cultivation method made it so that there was no forum for her to discuss with, and everyone who practised it happened to be of one mind. Secondly, her excitement dimmed knowing that the people she needed to content with had far greater experience in both the cultivation method and in life.\n\nEvery practitioner of the Heavenly Eye had lived for at least a thousand years, some even longer. During their lives, they must have traveled accross the planet- multiple planets before the Age of Isolation. From those travels they would have assimilated a plethora of knowledge which would further widen their own understanding of the world. What Marie was doing at the moment was pitting her measly fifteen years of experience, of which the first five were barely a blur, against that of her ancestors who each had a hundred times her living experience. Even thinking it made her feel stupid. Those before her must have already walked down her line of reasoning. They must have already spent years trying to unravel the mysteries of the Heavenly Eye to find safe alternatives. But seeing as none of their successful exploits were recorded in the collection Master carried with him, it could be inferred that everyone must have failed.\n\n\"It's universally accepted that no power comes for free,\" her Master told her a week back. \"I've told this to you many times before. In gaining unimaginable power and abilities, one must sacrifice something in the process. Most, if not all mages have come to accept that fact. The practitioners of the Heavenly Eye have also accepted this. After running innumerable cost-benefit analyses on the cultivation path, the cost of losing a small part of their body in benefit of gaining the power to observe fate in all its form was deemed profitable in the grand scheme of things. In fact, we reached this point after years and years of research, trials and errors. This was accepted as the best course of action for many generations.\"\n\n\"There has to be another way,\" Marie reaffirmed, although her stubbornness was waning.\n\n\"To want everything without giving anything is just being greedy,\" her Master reprimanded. \"Although I respect and appreciate your need to protect me, I don't want you to walk down this path if it is consuming you. Greed often leads you down a self-destructive path where you percieve to lose nothing when in fact you're sacrificing everything else that matters to you.\"\n\n\"What I want is for everyone to be safe, all this power is secondary,\" Marie refuted. \"If the people I care about have to bear the sacrifice for my gains, then the power gained isn't worthwhile.\"\n\n\"In fact I don't need the Heavenly Eye; I will settle for something lesser,\" she declared then. But till date, she has yet to make any headway into finding this alternative. At this moment, she was willing to give up. Seconds counted down as her mind ran the numbers - Marie was stubborn but not irrational. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.\n\n\"MARIE! MARIE!\" Dora's excited voice interrupted Marie's computations. \"Teacher Larks- I mean Mister Larks has returned!\"\n\nThe little girl was bouncing with overflowing emotions, something which her twin brother shared in a more muted sense given his introverted character.\n\n\"Has it been a month already?\" Marie muttered out loud. It had not...\n\n\"Come, let's go!\" Dora urged by pulling Marie's hand. With an acquiescing smile, the older girl complied and allowed herself to be guided by the little rabbit.\n\nMarie had foreseen this even through her Heavenly Eye. It was supposed to happen in another week's time, yet the event was preempted. It was Transient, such deviations were expected, but Marie didn't do anything out of ordinary that could have resulted in this drastic change. With a slight furrow, Marie stepped to the side and muttered, \"Were you responsible for Mister Larks' early return?\"\n\nShe knew that her Master had his attention on her at all times during the day. It was pervasive but understandable. True to her assumption, a positive response resounded in her mind. Voice transmission.\n\n\"I could see you struggling,\" her Master's voice added. \"I thought that maybe Guy might offer you some change in perspective.\"\n\nMarie felt warmth bubbling inside her. \"H-How did you do it? You never left the village...\"\n\n\"That's a secret for later. You will learn to do it yourself in due time,\" his voice answered. She could hear a mirthful chuckle underlying the response.\n\nMarie met up with Mister Larks and Markus outside the orphanage. Mister Larks was carrying Dora and Kano on each of his shoulders and blowing into their tummy eliciting a tickled laugh from each of them. Markus was carrying a few bags, with little difficulty. Her gaze then moved past them, and she noticed a hefty figure lumbering up the stairs with heavy breaths.\n\n\"Who's this?\" Marie inquired Markus.\n\n\"This is my friend, Furion,\" Markus answered. \"His father owns Dune Caravan Management. He'll be with us over the Summer break.\"\n\nMarie's eyes burst out her sockets in shock, \"THE Dune Caravan Management? You're joking!\"\n\nDuring her time working with different trading caravans, Marie had stumbled upon Dune many times. She never got an opportunity to work for them given their extremely thorough vetting process, but they had a stellar record of delivery and customer satisfaction in the industry. To hear that her brother was acquainted with the heir to the company came as a world-shattering surprise. What astounded her further was that she didn't see this boy in her earlier vision - probably a result of her Master's tampering with the event.\n\n\"Furion here will assist in managing the Verum Trading Company I was talking about,\" Mister Larks clarified. \"As a Sect Leader, it will be difficult for me to split my time between managing the Sect and managing the company, so I'm training Furion here to handle the business side of things. He's extremely capable, he even managed to snag us a few pre-orders of the Gutenberg Press!\"\n\nThe boy called Furion revealed a proud smile between his wheezes at Mister Larks' praise. \"I... try...\"\n\n\"He's being modest,\" Mister Larks added. \"I gave you a difficult task in the first place. Chances of succeeding were slim, yet you managed, which is commendable! Just remember the process and don't get complacent\"\n\n\"It was all coincidental,\" the boy responded. \"All the scribes employed by the publisher got snatched by a rival at the exact moment I arrived. The only reason he was so amiable to the purchase was because he was desperate and didn't have enough time to think things through.\"\n\n\"That really is a coincidence,\" Marie hummed as she narrowed her gaze. Her Master played his hand magnificently. It may be a bit heavy-handed in his approach, but it was effective.\n\n\"Nonetheless, a success is a success,\" Mister Larks repeated. \"Let's not waste anymore time here and go in. Furion, you may have to bunk with Markus for the time being. He will guide you around the orphanage. Please be mindful of the people living here.\"\n\nAnd with that, the group split up. Mister Larks carried the twins into the orphanage while Markus took his friend around the area. Marie chose to follow Mister Larks.\n\n____\n\nMarie had something in her mind. Guy could feel it, not just because the girl had been tailing him for a good hour, but also because there was this constipated expression on her face the entire time. So, after greeting Grace and the others of his return, he led the girl to his room.\n\n\"So, what's eating you? I wanted to wait until tomorrow, after I've had a good rest, but it looks like you won't be able to last that long,\" Guy chuckled.\n\nBut then, like the opening of a great flood gate, Marie's lips parted and a jumble of words gushed out. Guy lost track after the first sentence. He waited till the girl exhausted herself, which took half an hour.\n\n\"That was a lot,\" Guy said with a bitter smile. \"I don't think I followed after your first sentence. You might have to take me through your problem once again.\"\n\nMarie released a long exhale and said, \"I apologise. It's not right to dump my problems on you like this.\"\n\n\"It's not an issue at all. I appreciate that you've come to me with your concerns,\" Guy refuted immediately. \"If I may, why don't you take this day to settle your agitation and structure your inquiry more properly? Come back to me tomorrow and we will continue where we left off.\"\n\nThe girl nodded and bid Guy farewell for the day. Guy observed her troubled figure retreat and sighed in satisfaction. He did not enjoy the trip in the slightest. Business management was not his cup of tea at all. This! Teaching and guiding students is what he lived for.\n\n\"It's good to be back. Might as well enjoy the peace while it lasts.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-210]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":8,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 208 - Divining the Fate of Schrödinger's Cat","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\nFollowing the confrontation between Disciple and Master, a drastic shift in dynamic had transpired within the cottage - Marie had now taken charge of the matter of her own advancement.\n\n\"Let's break it down all the way to the basics,\" Marie commanded.\n\n\"This isn't necessary-\"\n\nMarie shot back with a stern glare that caused Krish to choke on his words. He could see that she wouldn't budge on this issue, not one bit.\n\n\"How do you mean?\" Krish acquiesced with a sigh.\n\n\"Let me get this straight - correct me if I'm wrong,\" Marie prefaced. \"In order to advance into Foundation Establishment, do I need to alter a Constant event, or experience the backlash from the Universe?\"\n\nKrish frowned contemplatively and asked, \"Is there a difference?\"\n\n\"Definitely!\" Marie affirmed.\n\n\"How so? To my knowledge, altering a Constant elicits a backlash from the Universe. The two events are tied together,\" Krish rebutted.\n\nMarie shook her head vehemently and stated her point, \"I've been thinking about it a lot after I left yesterday. I remember learning something interesting during a lesson with Mister Larks. When it starts to rain heavily, with heavy storm clouds blotting the skies, you often observe lightning cracking frequently. What follows the flash of lightning is a loud boom of thunder. Kids who do not know what those two are can often make a false connection and presume that since thunder follows lightning every time, therefore thunder is caused by lightning. Do you believe that statement to be true?\"\n\nKrish shook his head lightly and said, \"That's false. Thunder and lightning both occur simultaneously. They are a result of a singular event.\"\n\nMarie snapped her finger and emphasised, \"That's it! You see, what we have here is a common logical fallacy labelled |post hoc ergo propter hoc|.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" Krish blurted out.\n\n\"Umm... Mister Larks said that it means 'after this, therefore because of this,' in Latin,\" Marie responded while scratching her head.\n\n\"Latin?\"\n\n\"Mister Larks said that it's a dead language...\"\n\nKrish narrowed his eyes and commented, \"I've never heard of such a language before.\"\n\nMarie clicked her tongue in annoyance and said, \"Does that matter right now? Please don't distract me Master.\"\n\nKrish chuckled at his Disciple's stern warning and raised his hands in defeat.\n\n\"Basically, the phrase means that since event A occurred, then event B occurred, A is caused by B. Another example is that since the sun rises after a rooster crows, therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise.\"\n\n\"That's obviously incorrect,\" Krish confirmed.\n\n\"That's exactly my point. According to Mister Larks, almost everyone can fall victim to this fallacy if they do not maintain a healthy sense of criticism about what they see and observe every day. This is also a result of poor transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. Master, why do you believe that process of altering Constants and suffering a backlash have a cause-effect relationship? Is it because you have personally experimented with and evaluated the two phenomenon or is it because you took what your Master taught you and went along with it?\"\n\nKrish hummed as he reflected on his beliefs. As he formulated an answer to his Disciple's question, his eyes started to widen in shock.\n\n\"Are you saying that the Universe's backlash has nothing to do with altering a Constant?\" Krish asked with an excited glint in his eyes.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Marie shrugged. \"I haven't even observed a Constant with the Heavenly Eye, I cannot give you an answer to that question.\"\n\nAlthough his elation was deflated, Krish was quick to grasp the implication of Marie's proposition. \"If we can determine whether they hold a cause-effect relationship or not, we can then isolate the true condition needed to advance into Foundation Establishment realm. Am I right?\"\n\nBut then, Krish furrowed his brows and added, \"How do we even prove this? In order to affect a Constant, we need to first identify it. However, to identify it, we need to utilise the Heavenly Eye. It's a circular trap...\"\n\n\"I thought about that as well!\" Marie responded animatedly. \"I arrived at that same conclusion. But then, I took a few steps back and observed the problem from afar, which in turn helped me remember something.\"\n\n\"One day, when I was chatting with Mister Larks, and he introduced a thought experiment called 'Schrödinger's cat'.\"\n\n\"Who's Schrödinger?\" Krish interjected.\n\n\"I don't know,\" She shook her head and emphasised, \"That's not the point. The thought experiment was used to describe behaviour of subatomic particles. In it, a hypothetical was defined where a cate is placed inside a box with a hammer hanging over a glass flask of toxic poison. At some point in time, the hammer falls and breaks the poison flash which causes the liquid to vaporise and kill the cat. We, the observers standing outside the box, do not know when this hammer will fall. Therefore to us, the cat is both alive and dead until the box is opened.\"\n\n\"Can't you just use your mana sense to observe inside?\" Krish proposed.\n\n\"That's the point. If we don't use our senses to look inside, the cat's fate remains indeterminate. This thought experiment caused me to revisit the time of my transformation - when I acheived perfected resonance.\"\n\nShe then leaned forward and whispered, \"Can we enter the upper dimension?\"\n\nKrish entertained his Disciple's request and activated the formation lined in his cottage walls. With a recognisable ripple they were displaced and brought into the mysterious and isolated upper dimension.\n\nMarie cleared her throat and said, \"|I am an observer of Fate. I exist outside its domain, though my actions are governed by its ebb and flow. My aberrance shifts the trajectory of Fate at the cost of my existence, and my compliance moves it in its current trajectory. The cost of my aberrance is exempted if I am ignorant, for my actions unforeseen by the Heavenly Eye are by definition predetermined by Fate.|\"\n\nKrish tilted his head and said, \"That's a part of what you had to say during your transformation.\"\n\n\"Although my grasp of the vocabulary and grammar in Ancient Tongue isn't anything to brag about, I managed to translate a segment of it through context clues. |The cost of my aberrance is exempted if I am ignorant, for my actions unforeseen by the Heavenly Eye are by definition predetermined by Fate.|\"\n\n\"Within the verses spoken to activate my transformation, I noticed that we target the Heavenly Eye as the conduit that observes fate. In the above line, we are exempted from retribution if we are ignorant. And we are considered to be ignorant if we do not see the future through the Heavenly Eye. Therefore, if we do see the future - by that I am obviously referring to the Constants - without using the Heavenly Eye and then manage to change it, the shift is by definition 'predetermined' by fate and is exempt from retribution.\"\n\nKrish raised a finger and countered, \"But if the alteration is predetermined by fate, it isn't really changing anything, right?\"\n\n\"Not if the one performing the alteration is an 'apostle of Fate',\" Marie reminded. \"|I can now see the future of everything around me, but my future ceases to exist|. I am no longer bound by fate's sequence. You shouldn't be able to see my future using your Heavenly Eye any more.\"\n\n\"Smart girl!\" Krish praised while sporting a proud smile.\n\n\"What we need now, is a way to determine whether the cat in the box is dead or alive without opening the box or using any of our senses to gaze inside. To translate that metaphor, we need to determine a strategy to divine Constants without the Heavenly Eye,\" Marie concluded.\n\n\"That's easier said that done,\" Krish sighed. \"The Heavenly Eye has been around for many, many millennia. If there WAS a way around it, it would have been discovered.\"\n\n\"Master,\" Marie grunted exasperatedly. \"I'd appreciate a little more faith in my abilities.\"\n\nKrish smile apologetically and said, \"Force of habit, I apologise. Now that I think about it, you might be the first one to make these connections and truly deconstruct the logic underlying our cultivation method. I'm sure you'll succeed in finding the solution!\"\n\nThose weren't empty words. Krish really did hold a glimmer of hope that his Disciple might achieve something great - something unheard of and unattempted throughout the Heavenly Eye's lineage. He knew for a fact that every one of his predecessors were quick to assume their Master's words as the absolute truth - even Krish fell victim to this frame of mind. Marie may be the first of their line to ever question what she was being taught, and properly critique the purpose, value and applicability of the knowledge she was being presented.\n\n\"I'll definitely figure it out!\" Marie promised. \"Until I do that, I don't want to hear anything about you sacrificing body parts for my sake,\" she then warned.\n\n\"Just as you're responsible for me, I am responsible for you,\" she muttered with an embarrassed frown. \"I don't wish to lose you in any way. Not yet at least, and definitely not for something so trivial as this!\"\n\nKrish gazed appreciatively at his Disciple as a pleasant warmth washed over him. 'Is this what it feels like to have someone care for you?'\n\n\"I promise I won't do anything stupid, my dear Disciple,\" Krish affirmed with a light-hearted and mirthful laugh. \"I'll wait patiently till you've finalised your decision.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-209]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":9,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 207 - Stalling","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nMarie delve into the use and application of the Heavenly Eye was controlled, stringently so. She was not allowed to use it without her Master present, nor was she allowed to observe the visions corresponding to Constants in the grand tapestry of Fate. On that note, how can one differentiate between the Transients and Constants when performing Divinations?\n\nOne of Marie's subconscious fears was unwittingly gazing into a Constant and accidentally setting into motion a chain of events that lead to a deviation, which would inevitably come back to bite her. However, thankfully, the Heavenly Eye made it extremely easy to identify Constants. As she gazed into the emitted waves of fate when divining the answer to a question, the wave would decompose and turn into a net of silvers strings extending in all directions, with thicknesses determining their relevance to her question. Amongst these silver strings, she would often find ones that were a pure and lustrous gold shade.  \n\nHer Master had expressly warned her NOT to even glance at these gold strings to avoid accidentally triggering their vision. Of course, being told NOT to do something just made her want to do it more. However, Marie's sense of self-preservation was stronger than her curiousity, hence she actively tempered her gaze. One thing she noted during her time divining with the Heavenly Eye was that there were always Constants amidst the answer to any question. Through controlled experiments with her Master, who was uncharacteristically compliant with her requests and observed Constants on her behalf, she managed to put together a workable theory of how fate and futuresight worked.\n\nIn this world, there are infinite ways in which a single decision can shape the future. The choice between which hat to wear out of the two stored in the closet can itself change the flow of event down the line. Each of these alternate sequences can be defined as a thread extending to eternity along the time axis. By layering the multitude of alternate sequences over each other, we obtain a bundle that defines how events will transpire accross different realities extending to eternity.\n\nHowever, upon doing so, one quickly finds that the bundle is itself infinitely thick, since there are an infinite number of realities due to the infinite combinations and permutations of the various choices every person across this universe is forced to make every minute- every second- of their lives. According to Mister Larks, a theory defines these infinite realities as parallel universes that are layered on top of each other. But what is stopping these parallel universes from collapsing onto each other?\n\nThis is where the concept of Constants and Transients comes in. Marie cobbled up a base theory based on a series of observations and assumptions, given her limited experience on the topic. Constants act as ties that tether the infinitely thick bundle at different points in time. Multiple Constants, spread out over different intervals accross eternity ensure that the bundle never gets frayed and is always stable. In a sense, these Constants act as anchor points in time that ensure that no matter how many times the sequence is split due to the minute variations in the chain of event, it will inevitably pass through a Constant. This essentially denies the existence of parallel universes that threaten the stability of reality. It negates the possibility of someone jumping ship to another reality where they don't have to face the consequences of their decision or action at an earlier point in time. Since the moment they do something, say something, or react in a particular way, the sequence of events is set in stone - there is no going back, only forward.\n\nThis is also why tampering with constants is so dangerous. In doing so, one would essentially unravel the bundle at a point in time and tie a new tether. In this process, one may lose a few of the pre-existing strings that were included in the earlier bundle which snowballs down the line.\n\nMarie's practice session with her Master, in testing out Divination with the Heavenly Eye, lasted for another week and a half and threatened to extend for a longer duration even after she had confirmed her satisfactory proficiency in this matter. Marie started to get this itch that her Master was purposefully stalling her progress. But for the life of her, she could not understand why? After a few more days of inactivity and monotonous practice, Marie decided to grab the bull by its horns and confronted her Master.\n\n\"We'll be extending the duration of the divination using the Heavenly Eye today,\" her Master declared right as she entered the cottage.\n\n\"Why?\" Marie shot back with a slight confrontational tone.\n\n\"What do you mean why?\"\n\n\"If I remember correctly, you said that using the Heavenly Eye for Divination is pointless given the efficacy and efficiency of my own method. However, contrary to that statement, we have been practising and stress-testing my ability to divine the future using the Heavenly Eye for the past few days,\" Marie explained. \"I don't see the point in continuing with this.\"\n\n\"I-It's to consolidate your abilities,\" Krish responded hurriedly.\n\n\"Consolidate in preparation of what?\" Marie retorted. \"I thought the purpose of unlocking the Heavenly Eye was so that I could now observe and work with Constants. Yet you've explicitly forbidden be from looking into them, even though I am using my powers only under your surveillance.\"\n\nMarie noticed Krish's usually calm expression waver as he searched for a reasonable explanation. Evidently, he was failing at it, quite miserably at that.\n\n\"You are stalling, aren't you Master?\" Marie probed. Although she did not receive a response, she could read the meaning hidden in her Master's silence and averted gaze.\n\n\"Why?\" Marie jabbed. \"There has to be a reason for your hesitance. Is there something wrong with me?\"\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with you!\" Krish denied vehemently. Marie was convinced of it after noticing the sincerity of the response.\n\n\"Then? Why haven't you allowed me to observe Constants?\"\n\nKrish pulled his lips flat and exhaled loudly through his nose. He started to weave together intricate answers to assuage the girl's anxiety and also throw her off his trail. But when his eyes bet hers, all the lies floating through his head crumbled.\n\n\"I'm stalling because I'm stuck,\" he confessed.\n\n\"Do you not know how I can advance to Foundation Establishment realm?\"\n\n\"No, it's because I know exactly WHAT the conditions are for you to advance that I am stalling,\" he corrected.\n\n\"Master I won't know unless you tell me,\" Marie said with an exasperated smile.\n\n\"To become a true mage of the Heavenly Eye one must tamper with fate's machinations in a permanent scale,\" Krish orated. \"Do you understand what that means? You've been messing with Transients all this while, but you must be aware that your actions did little to shift the dominoes in any way. To truly manifest a lasting change you need to target the events which keep our reality stable.\"\n\n\"So you're saying that the condition required for me to step into the Foundation Establishment realm is to alter a Constant?\" Marie clarified, to which she recevied a morose nod from her Master.\n\n\"That's... unfortunate,\" she muttered.\n\n\"Exactly. All this time, I've been wracking my brain to come up with an alternate. I don't want you to have to suffer through the pain of losing a part of yourself, Marie,\" Krish reasoned. \"The only solution I've found till now, which might work, is if I can redirect the backlash targeting you to me instead.\"\n\n\"Why would you do that?\" Marie blurted out.\n\n\"You're my Disciple, Marie. This is my duty as your Master,\" he responded.\n\n\"Did your Master do it for you?\" She retaliated. The response was another uncomfortable bout of silence. \"I take it that they didn't.\"\n\n\"Forget about what my Master did or did not do,\" Krish said while waving his hands. \"This is a matter between the two of us. If you can wait for a few more days, I can perfect the transference process, and we can proceed with your advancement.\"\n\n\"Why do you assume that I'll just let you do that to yourself?\" Marie challenged.\n\n\"Marie-\"\n\n\"No! If you're averse to me suffering from the Universe's backlash, why do you assume I would be willing to let you suffer through the same?\" Marie interrupted.\n\n\"You have so much left in your life,\" Krish explained. \"You're young, hopeful and bright - you are bound to achieve great things! Why would you want to cripple yourself in some way so early? Me on the other hand, I'm spent. All I need right now is to be able to live to see you reach great heights. I can afford to lose a finger or two at this point.\"\n\nMarie was floored by her Master's unfiltered sincerity and heartfelt words. She never thought that such a cynical man would have such selfless sentiments. Her mouth bobbed up and down like a fish as she tried to respond, yet her brain failed to form any corrigible words or phrases. As she looked into her Master's eyes, she could see a bloom of warmth which she had only seen in Matron Reva's and Mister Larks' gaze. The feeling was overwhelming and smothered her with giddiness. Those emotions ran rampant around her mind and heart, searching for an avenue for escape. After a hurried search, they found an exit and surged out with gusto. Unfortunately, the exit happened to be Marie's tear ducts.\n\nMarie covered her face and ran out of her Master's cottage without saying a word. Just like that, she rushed up the steps leading to the orphanage while trying her utter best to suppress the whimpers eking through the gaps of her fingers.\n\nBack at the orphanage, Krish observed Marie's behaviour using his mana sense and released a difficult breath. He then chuckled dryly as he realised how his thought process had shifted within the span of a single year. He couldn't recollect the last time he felt so magnanimous in his life. He'd dropped that emotion the day the Universe took his leg. What surprised him was the shift in his circumstances, more specifically his own thoughts on the matter. Back then, he was reluctant to lose a part of his body in trying to help others yet now, he was willing to sacrifice his body for another.\n\n\"I can't say if this is a good thing, or a bad thing,\" Krish said with a bitter smile. \"But all I know for sure is that I don't feel bad about it. Which scares me...\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-208]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":10,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 206 - Through the Heavenly Eye","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nKrish observed Marie, his Disciple, with a sublime smile - one that originated from the deepest recesses of his heart which had frozen over many years ago. It was in moments like these, marinating in the achievements of his Disciple, that he would remember the oft spoken words of his own Master as he was approaching his end.\n\n\"As practitioners of the Heavenly Eye, we have very little to look forward to in our lives. With all the power of foresight that our cultivation grants us, it takes away something very important that motivates us to look forward to the next day - hope. This was until I took on a Disciple. After you became my ward, every day presented me with new possibilities. Every time you made progress, I would immediately look forward to the new heights you would reach. Hope was brought back into my life.\"\n\nAt this moment, Krish could empathise with his Master. As he observed his Disciple progress, the long-lost hopefulness was reinvigorated and his frozen heart began to thaw anew. But everything good must come to an end eventually - a pained frown formed on Krish's face and began to deepen progressively.\n\nThis change wasn't missed by Marie who, although entrenched in an excited trance, was fully aware of her surroundings - especially her Master.\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" She asked casually.\n\nKrish inhaled deeply and said, \"Not at the moment. Don't overuse the Heavenly Eye you don't have enough mana to sustain it for long. I don't want Matron Reva coming after me again.\"\n\nMarie chuckled and dissipated the gold luminance from her eyes.\n\n\"Rest well today, don't overexert yourself. Tomorrow, I will show you how to use the Heavenly Eye in place of Divination,\" Krish continued.\n\n\"Is there a reason for that? Since Divination works well enough for me, why don't we try something else?\" Marie proposed.\n\n\"My intention isn't for you to drop Divination due to it becoming redundant. I've already established that it is far safer to divine the future than to observe it directly with the Heavenly Eye. The reason why we're starting this way is because it will help you grow familiar with the Heavenly Eye more quickly,\" Krish explained.\n\n\"Off you go!\" He waved as he urge the girl out of the cottage.\n\nAs Krish observed her back jubilantly bobbing up the steps, his previous frown returned once again.\n\nWhen he achieved perfected resonance, his Master told him: \"Power always requires a sacrifice.\"\n\nKrish didn't know what he meant, nor did he recognise the severity of those words. It was only much later, when he attempted to breach into the Foundation Establishment realm that he experienced just how soaked in irony magic was.\n\nAs Al grew stronger and stronger by consuming more and more knowledge, he sacrificed the ability to innovate. The more Guy pursues the so-called \"Truth\" of the world, the quicker he loses his own grasp of reality.\n\nJust like that, the cost one must pay to gaze further into the cryptic phenomenon called \"Fate\" is their present. To see the future, a part of their present needs to be lost. And that is what Marie needed to experience to jump from Mana Condensation realm into the Foundation Establishment realm and become a true mage. Krish knew this for a fact. If it were before, Krish would have forced Marie to go through with it right after her perfected resonance and pushed her into the Foundation Establishment realm - just like how his own Master did with him.\n\nYet now Krish was hesitating. He did not want her to experience it - the pain. Why was that? Did his own Master feel that way about him? Krish didn't think so since he didn't feel any hesitance or reluctance in his Master's actions.\n\nKrish hummed and entered a meditative state, as he pondered over his thoughts and actions.\n\n'Why am I behaving this way?' Why was he suddenly letting emotions dictate his decisions. Krish firmly believed that his Master had turned him into a cold, calculative mechanism like himself. If this were true, then his mind should not have wavered earlier. The fact that it did implied that the impeccable mechanism was compromised - rust had taken hold.\n\n'Is it undesirable?' Krish countered. To call it rust would mean that Krish was averse to this change. The fact was, Krish did not despise his new outlook. It made him feel more alive - more involved with the world around him. He was fully aware that in doing so he had opened himself up to greater danger. The more he cared about others, the more he would feel inclined to adjust their fates. A quick glance to his deformed leg cemented that thought.\n\n'Then WHY?! Why am I still not discouraged?' This was a question he could not find the answer to with his Heavenly Eye.\n\n\"Even after all these years, I'm still discovering new facets about myself,\" Krish sighed. He then collapsed onto his mattress and chuckled. \"Maybe this is how Master managed to live for so long. He must have unearthed parts of himself he never even knew about by interacting with me. Now that I think about it, when he passed, his character was nothing like the man who took me in as his Disciple.\"\n\n\"I guess this is my path now,\" Krish muttered. \"I must prepare for it accordingly. There has to be an alternative.\"\n\n____\n\nThe following day, Marie arrived at Krish's cottage punctually. He could feel the excitement oozing out of her body even before opening the door.\n\n\"Master!\" She called out. \"I'm here. Let's do this!\"\n\n\"Calm down, there's no hurry,\" Krish responded as he opened the door.\n\n\"Of course YOU would say that,\" Marie grumbled while entering.\n\n\"There's no need to be impatient. We cannot be hasty, it is not safe,\" Krish advised.\n\n\"I'm patient. It's just that I have this feeling that I'm really close, you know?\" She answered. \"The sooner I learn how to use the Heavenly Eye properly, the sooner I can advance to Foundation Establishment realm.\"\n\nKrish revealed a twitching smile and redirected the discussion, \"Sit in the lotus position. Follow the same method I taught you yesterday to activate the Eye.\"\n\nMarrie hummed affirmatively and closed her eye to focus on the flow of her mana. She moved it through her channels, towards her eyes and let them saturate. With a slow reveal, her eyelids separated revealing a pair of bright golden pupils.\n\n\"What do I do now?\" Marie asked.\n\n\"Throttle the flow of mana to your eyes first. You're expending more than is required,\" Krish instructed. \"Decrease the flow until I say stop.\"\n\nMarie proceeded to do just that, and started to lower the mana flowing through her channels. To do this, she had to control the mana released from her nascent core that was allowed to circulate through her body. As she was in the Mana Condensation realm, and was yet to form a proper core, this process was much harder and required her to enter a perfectly controlled meditative state where she was aware of what transpired within her body.\n\nSlowly, the brightness in her eyes started to dim, although the gold wash remained permanent.\n\n\"That's sufficient,\" Krish reminded. \"Divining with the Heavenly Eye is similar to the method we've worked with before. For one, you will have to state the inquiry you wish to receive the answer to, and you will need to obtain the answer from the waves of fate that are emitted and received from the world. However, the intermediate steps vary significantly.\"\n\n\"A word of caution,\" Krish paused. \"Although the results obtained from the Heavenly Eye are extremely precise and descriptive, they expend significantly more mana per use. Before, this expenditure could be justified since regular Divination was highly subjective and was equally lacking in precision. However, with the method you've developed, I don't think that is the case any more. At this point, the only benefit of using the Heavenly Eye to divine the future is if the question alludes to Constant events.\"\n\n\"Now clear your mind, and ask a very basic question,\" Krish started. \"Once the question is asked, focus only on the wave that is being emitted.\"\n\nMarie sucked on the inside of her teeth as she thought over her inquiry. \"When will Mister Larks return to Twilight Village?\"\n\nThe moment the words left her mouth, so did a series of waves. Unlike earlier, Marie did not have to tune into the \"frequency\" of the waves of fate to with her mana sense. Her eyes could ACTUALLY see them move. Without wasting another moment she tuned her focus on the wave. Within seconds of doing so, she felt her vision warping. The wave started to split before her eyes. Instead of acting like a regular wave spreading outwards like before, what she saw were a multitude of silver-coloured strings that extended from her to different locations. Some of these strings were thick, others not so much. What they all had in common were vibrations, as in they were all twitching periodically.\n\n\"These strings are tied to potential entities, living or non-living, that may be related to the question you've proposed. Each of them will indicate how these entities will influence the outcome. The Heavenly Eye decomposes the waves of fate automatically for you, just like how your original method does it. To decipher the response, focus on any string in front of you. The thicker they are, the greater their involvement in the outcome.\"\n\nMarie followed the instructions and shifted her focus to the thickest string originating from her. At that instant, she felt her sight shifting. The world around her split into a lustrous golden cloud, that started to turn colours rapidly.\n\nWith a flourish, her vision gained clarity. At this instant, she no longer felt as though she was inhabiting a body - she felt like a disembodied head floating around. She was currently \"floating\" inside what looked like a luxurious carriage. It was rocking jerkily, which reminded her of the painful ride to the village.\n\n\"I did not expect that we would return so soon, Master,\" Markus' voice hooked her attention. \"It's only been a month. I believe we still have some more work left?\"\n\n\"The builders will be arriving very soon. I need to prepare the area and finish up the plans,\" Mister Larks' voice answered. Marie turned around and saw the two conversers shifting their weight between their buttocks to offset the ache brought upon by their ride.\n\n\"Why hasn't anyone developed some form of suspension system for these carriages!\" Mister Larks exclaimed as his head collided against the walls of the carriage.\n\nAnd with that, the vision dissipated and Marie found herself back in the cottage with her Master. Before she could speak, though, she suddenly felt sapped of energy and collapsed on her back. She hadn't lost her consciousness yet, but she was exhausted.\n\n\"As I said,\" her Master's voice spoke up. \"It is immensely taxing, but equally precise.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-207]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":11,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 205 - Opening the Heavenly Eye","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n\"I will warn you, this is not going to be a pleasant feeling,\" Krish reminded Marie. \"We will be forcefully changing your body to accommodate phenomena it should naturally be incapable of. Also, if you do not repeat the phrase exactly as I say it, the result may deviate drastically, which in turn will cause you greater discomfort. So, once again, repeat the phrases exactly as I say them.\"\n\n\"I'm having second thoughts,\" Marie blurted out with a twitching smile.\n\n\"You either do it now or at a later date,\" Krish reminded her.\n\n\"I choose a later date!\" Marie exclaimed.\n\nKrish snorted playfully and said, \"Stop putting it off. You're well-prepared for this.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" Marie responded, displaying a rare instance of her vulnerability. Krish often forgot the girl was only fifteen-years-old.\n\n'My goodness! We've only been together for a year?' Krish shuddered upon recollecting their unfathomable progress. Even in his youth, it took him three years to reach this point, and his Master praised him as a prodigy who broke many records amongst the ancestors of the Heavenly Eye. Nonetheless, the tinge of jealousy that flashed in his thoughts was immediately drowned by an overwhelming sense of pride. 'This is my Disciple!'\n\n\"Nothing's going to go wrong as long as I am with you,\" Krish said with a low, reassuring voice. He then revealed a sly smile and added, \"Do you realise just how difficult it was for me to find a Disciple? 1000 years - it took me an entire millennium to find you. So, do you think I will just let you slip through my fingers because of something so trivial?\"\n\nHis words brought some levity and raised the wavering girl's confidence.\n\n\"Shall we begin?\" Krish reiterated. The girl exhaled loudly to clear her indecisiveness and nodded slightly in affirmation.\n\nWithout a moment of dalliance, Krish reactivated the formation embedded into his cottage walls and plunged himself and his Disciple into the upper dimension.\n\n\"As you've seen already, the effects of Ancient Tongue are immediate,\" Krish prefaced. \"The moment they leave your mouth, and are spoken with the right pronunciation, the world itself will bend to reflect the implications of those words. It is a powerful tool, but can also be dangerous if not properly applied.\"\n\n\"Till now, we've primarily been working with simple, singular phrases. Sentences that stand alone and imply one thing. 'The sky is clear', 'The wind blows northwards', 'It is raining heavily', to name a few examples. However, we are yet to touch upon proses that can portray complex thoughts and ideas. These may contain a myriad of declarations and assertions that can conflict with each other. For example, 'The river water flows erratically all the time. During winter, the river freezes over.' These two sentences, to us, can be logically deciphered to imply that while the river water flows erratically on a regular day, during winter it does not as the water is frozen. Ancient Tongue is an explicit language, thus we need to use the correct words and syntax to imply exactly what we want. The earlier logical trap can result in conflicting assertions which in turn lead to instability.\"\n\n\"Another thing you should have noticed by now is that I did not teach you the past tense in Ancient Tongue. Actually, the past tense is the only tense in Ancient Tongue that implies opinion or perspective as opposed to objective assertion. Ancient Tongue can do many things, but it cannot change the past. Even if you assert that 'the trees in the forest had all fallen over two weeks back,' it won't just transpire as such in the past. If translated to Ancient Tongue, the closest alternative would be: 'It is believed that the trees in the forest had all fallen over two weeks back'. As a result, what happens is that the memories and recollections of everyone who observed or saw the forest two weeks prior will automatically be changed to reflect this assertion. When they revisit the forest at a later date and see the trees healthy and erect, they will inevitably experience a mental crisis.\"\n\n\"To bring this all together, what I will have you chanting will be a series of assertions about your body, including exceptions that will negate any overlaps or conflicts,\" Krish confirmed. \"Ready?\"\n\n\"I'm ready!\" Marie responded as she sat cross-legged facing her Master.\n\n\"Repeat after me, |I am an apostle of Fate, one of the fundamental forces that drive this world.|\"\n\n\"|I am an apostle of Fate, one of the fundamental forces that drive this world.|\" Marie repeated. As she did so, she started to feel a gushing heat originating from her abdomen. She ignored this development and kept her attention trained on her Master's next words.\n\n\"|Fate flows through me and around me, and I have the power to tap into Fate's waves and move them to my will.|\"\n\nMarie droned the words precisely, and she could now feel her body vibrating as a foreign pulse began to collide against her core region vehemently.\n\n\"|In gaining the power to tap into Fate, I become transformed. I rely on my ability to interpret Fate. The Heavenly Eye shines in my eye-sockets, illuminating Fate's far-reaching threads.|\"\n\nA burning sensation started to assault her pupils. Her core was vibrating even more maniacally and her mana was growing increasingly agitated.\n\n\"|I am an observer of Fate's machinations. I exist outside its domain, though my actions are governed by its ebb and flow. My aberrance shifts the trajectory of Fate at the cost of my existence, and my compliance moves it in its current trajectory. The cost of my aberrance is exempted if I am ignorant, for my actions unforeseen by the Heavenly Eye are by definition predetermined by Fate.|\"\n\nMarie nearly doubled over at the stabbing pain radiating all over her body. However, she grit her teeth and held herself together - she could feel herself nearing the cusp of something great and could not afford a mistake at this stage.\n\n\"|Now, as I gain the power to change my Fate, my Fate is forever sealed. I can now see the future of everything around me, but my future ceases to exist, for now, I am an apostle of Fate itself - a servant to its treacherous whims. I am an observer and an influencer of Fate's trajectory. And finally, I am the bearer of the Heavenly Eye.|\"\n\nMarie's body was on the verge of breaking at this point. This was because her body was begging for mana, but her surroundings were completely starved of it. Krish knew this would happen and immediately after Marie spoke the final word, he dissipated the formation and pulled them back out of the upper dimension. As the surrounding mana became replenished, it was immediately siphoned towards Marie hurriedly.\n\nThe phenomenon known as perfected resonance manifested in her, bringing a satisfied and relieved smile to Krish's face. He would be lying if he said he wasn't nervous about how the procedure would turn out. Entangling oneself with Ancient Tongue was risky business - there was a reason why it was now extinct. If anyone could do anything they wanted by simply speaking their minds, imagine the chaos that would ensue! \n\nKrish watched as Marie indulged in the surge of power coursing through her mana channels after the previous discomfort vanished. He revealed a tranquil smile as the agitating mana in and around her started to settle. It was always a pleasant feeling when one's hard work was rewarded and one grew stronger. It was even more pleasant to see one's pupils achieve successes - one could revel in the same uplifting emotion by proxy!\n\n\"D-Did I just-\" Marie mumbled, unable to complete her sentences due to her bubbling excitement.\n\n\"Congratulations!\" Krish answered with a proud smile. \"You have achieved perfected resonance. Although it was a foregone conclusion, your pace is unprecedented within our lineage.\"\n\nAs the final words left his mouth, he immediately recognised his folly. He had let an intimate detail slip in his haste. \n\n\"Did I beat you?\" Marie blurted in disbelief.\n\n\"Let's not get too conceited,\" Krish reminded as he tried to temper the girl's overconfidence. He knew that nothing was more dangerous for a practitioner of the Heavenly Eye than their own unbridled ego.\n\n\"Just let me have this moment,\" she shot back with an exaggerated, scandalous look. \"So... Do I have the Heavenly Eye now?\"\n\nKrish pursed his lips and nodded with an intense gaze. \"You are burdened with its power now. That's right, burden. Do not rely on it extensively, for doing so will make you grow dependent - addicted. But do not take what is shown to you lightly either.\"\n\n\"How do I activate it?\" Marie redirected.\n\n\"Weren't you listening?\" Krish exclaimed with an increased pitch. \"I just told you to not use it casually.\"\n\n\"But I just got this power! Come on, show me. Please? Please,\" Marie urged eagerly.\n\nKrish groaned loudly and said, \"Fine, but please don't make me regret teaching you how to do it. You must ONLY use the Heavenly Eye in my presence, got it?!\"\n\nMarie nodded hurriedly in response.\n\n\"Pull the mana from your core towards your eyes. You should feel that they are different. The process should be intuitive from that point onwards,\" Krish instructed.\n\nHis Disciple did as told and proceeded calmly. Although she was ecstatic after the recent events, she had the maturity and state of mind to not let it affect her technique. Krish kept his attention trained on his Disciple, looking out for any faults that may have remained after the forceful body restructuring session earlier. Sometimes the issue may not be evident at the time of implementation and would only show up later down the line. This was the perfect opportunity to pinpoint those issues.\n\nThankfully, his Disciple's transformation was without any flaw as her mana started to congregate at her eyeballs. He noticed a brazen smile splitting her face, which he rightly deciphered as her properly activating the Heavenly Eye. With a quick motion, her lids parted and two pairs of golden-coloured pupils gazed towards him.\n\nMarie started to cackle exuberantly and jolted her head to different places in the room, absorbing everything her new eyes could see.\n\n\"It works!\" She shouted amidst her laughter.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-206]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":12,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 204 - Ancient Tongue","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nAncient Tongue. The history regarding its origin and source is heavily contested across multiple published texts. Some believed it to be a language spoken by a precursor - a more magical - race that inhabited these planes. Opposers argued that if this were true, 'what led to their extinction?'\n\nBased on Guy's conceptualisation of magic, one could say that Ancient Tongue is as close as anyone can get to the absolute truths of this world. No, to be more precise, Ancient Tongue IS the TRUTH. Even if what is spoken is false, it becomes the truth.\n\n\"*cough* Urrro,\" Marie vocalised with difficulty as she combated the pain flaring down her throat.\n\n\"Wrong,\" Krish said while shaking his head. \"The sound has to be formed from your lungs, not with your tongue and mouth.\"\n\n\"How are we even supposed to do that?\" Marie whined.\n\n\"Use your mana,\" Krish instructed. \"Humans aren't designed to speak the Ancient Tongue. We don't have the organs required to create the specific sounds that comprise this language.\"\n\n\"Can you please repeat the sound?\" Marie asked while scratching her forehead. This would be her eighth time doing so, which exasperated her to no end, but she was helpless. There were no shortcuts in this.\n\n\"Listen carefully,\" Krish said without a hint of irritation or disappointment in his voice and reproduced the sound.\n\nThe sound was guttural and reverberated with a mechanical grind. Truthfully, Marie could not put the flavour of the noise her Master made into words. It both hurt her ears and soothed them at the same time.\n\n\"How many more sounds do we need to cover?\" Marie groaned.\n\n\"Thirty-two,\" Krish answered. \"That's just the start. You need to then cover over fifty compound sounds, vocabulary, grammar... All in all, it is an intensive process.\"\n\nMarie released a loud moan of defeat, \"Why don't you write all the sounds down and we can go through all of them at once? It seems highly inefficient to go at it one at a time.\"\n\n\"There is no textual form for the Ancient Tongue,\" Krish replied while shaking his head. \"And even if I did transcribe it using the Common Tongue for ease of understanding, it would introduce bias which will cause you to deviate from the true pronunciation of the sounds.\"\n\nThis was also the reason why it was essentially impossible to derive Ancient Tongue using modern chanting-based spells as reference. The years of written transcription, reinterpretation and mispronunciation had bastardised the language to such as extent that the Ancient Tongue used in these chanting-based spells barely resembled its true form. It was far too detached for linguistic experts to make logical interpolations and rediscover the original. Nowadays, although the chants worked and produced results, they were merely low imitations that only resembled a minute fraction of the spells' true power.\n\n\"So there is no alternative in this matter. And even if there were, I don't recommend that you pursue it. Disclosing the existence of Ancient Tongue is extremely dangerous and could lead to disastrous consequences. As I've repeated time and time again, this language was supposed to be extinct. It cannot exist! The only other language that is in use now which is close to Ancient Tongue is the Dwarven Language, but they have deviated to a more symbolic and prose-based form which has dissipated most of its potency.\"\n\n\"You've met Dwarves?\" Marie shot back.\n\n\"The Age of Isolation was before my time. But our ancestors were present when the planes were conjoined. In fact, there have been a few Dwarves and Elves amongst our lineage as well!\"\n\nMarie hummed in light contemplation before shaking her head and redirecting the conversation \"Be that as it may, how do you know the Ancient Tongue? By this, I mean how do we as practitioners of the Heavenly Eye know this?\"\n\n\"We've always known,\" Krish responded. \"The Heavenly Eye has a rich and far-reaching lineage. Once it's time, I will show you just how ancient it is. We were there when Ancient Tongue was the norm!\"\n\n\"But do you not see the irony?\" Marie exclaimed. Noticing Krish's confused frown, she coughed and expounded, \"As long as someone still speaks the language it cannot be considered extinct. We still speak the Ancient Tongue, how could it go extinct?\"\n\n\"It just did,\" Krish shrugged. \"I don't know what to tell you.\"\n\n\"There had to be a conscious effort from our side to let it go extinct,\" Marie clarified. \"While we still existed, we could have still taught people how to speak it, right?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Krish agreed.\n\n\"So why didn't we interfere?\" Marie emphasised.\n\n\"We did. There were a few of us that tried to teach the Ancient Tongue to others, but the world didn't let us,\" Krish revealed with a sigh.\n\n\"It didn't let you?\"\n\n\"We started to receive a backlash from the world every time we attempted to instruct others. At first, it was only mild - a sprain here, a cut there. But over time, it started to grow more egregious - a laceration, a fraction, even dismemberment. After a point, we started to catch on and realised that the world had deemed Ancient Tongue extinct,\" Krish finalised. \"Although, we were still allowed to continue learning and propagating the language within our lineage.\"\n\n\"That's not right,\" Marie said with a disconcerted frown. \"How can the world just decide when an entire culture should go extinct?\"\n\n\"It's just a language, Marie,\" Krish commented.\n\n\"It isn't JUST a language, Master. It is the crystallisation of a way of life. Everything a group of people believe, how they perceive their reality, and what they find to be moral, immoral, ethical and unethical can all be determined by learning these people's language. But now it's just all... gone. And it isn't even fair because there are still people who can speak it but aren't allowed to distribute this knowledge!\"\n\n\"Fate works in mysterious ways,\" Krish affirmed. \"No one can go against it - at least not anyone living within this world. We are just in the unfortunate position of knowing how fate is going to rear its head. Sometimes it truly is bliss to live in ignorance. But this is the burden we bear, there is no other option.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Marie muttered.\n\n\"Let's stop wasting time and try to make some progress today, shall we?\" Krish said while clapping his hands to boost Marie's motivation. \"On the bright side, once you can perfectly pronounce one sound from the Ancient Tongue phonics, the others are extremely easy to grasp.\"\n\nMarie shot a dubious look before humming, \"I will believe you.\"\n\nKrish rapped the back of her head and sneered back at her.\n\n____\n\nJust like her Master indicated, grasping the first sound was the greatest hurdle. After four days of fruitless crooning, Marie finally replicated the first sound. Then came the next, which was grasped in a single day. Following that, she breezed through the predetermined thirty-two in three days. The additional compound sounds took even less time, and she quickly found herself cruising through the grammar, semantics and vocabulary of the language. Even she was surprised by the ease with which she assimilated the language. It was surprisingly intuitive and flowed out of her mouth naturally. After learning newer vocabulary, she could readily place it into sentences without a hint of hesitance.\n\nMarie was confident that her pace could have been faster if she were allowed to practice outside the confines of her Master's cottage. There were times when sleep evaded her, and she was tempted to hone her language drills, but she reluctantly held her tongue - she was rebellious but not reckless. This was assisted by the myriad of truly horrific stories her Master would tell her to caution her against any ill-advised indiscretions.\n\nOne story to note involved a Heavenly Eye practitioner, who found their skin burning off and disintegrating. Another had their genitals twisted and subsequently exploded due to excess mana accumulation - although she lacked the extra 'appendages' to empathise, she imagined that it would not feel particularly pleasant. Some of the recounted afflictions were hard to fathom and sounded downright implausible, but her Master assured her that they were all in fact true.\n\nOn this particular day, which was exactly two weeks after she started learning the Ancient Tongue with her Master, Marie was back in her Master's cottage in the so-called upper dimension, holding a workable conversation.\n\n\"|Today is a pleasant day|,\" Marie said, and suddenly the room grew brighter as if the occluding clouds in the sky had all disappeared.\n\n\"|No, it seems that a light drizzle is just around the corner,|\" the brightness dimmed as rain clouds manifested out of nothingness.\n\n\"What does |drizzle| mean?\" Marie asked.\n\n\"A direct, and crude, translation would be light rain. However, it has a much, much deeper meaning to it. Imagine that the surrounding temperature decreased suddenly causing the sudden formation of low-hanging clouds. A brisk wind picks up, causing these clouds to break and release their contained water like a light mist. Now that is what |drizzle| means,\" Krish clarified.\n\n\"That's a lot of meaning for just one word,\" Marie whistled.\n\n\"But you should be able to see just how powerful it is with the limited vocabulary in your belt,\" Krish reminded. \"The dimension we are in isn't completely real, but the way the world behaves and reacts to your actions are faithful to the real world. Just a short sentence caused the sky to clear up, and then make a complete one-eighty and become cloudier all within the span of a minute.\"\n\n\"What will we be learning today?\" Marie inquired enthusiastically. After witnessing the potency of Ancient Tongue first-hand, her earlier apprehension and disappointment had vanished altogether.\n\n\"I think you are proficient enough,\" Krish declared. \"It is time for us to start your transformation.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-205]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":13,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 203 - Deadly Secrets","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Yes... this looks good,\" Krish muttered as he tapped at a specific location on his cottage wall. He then moved frantically to another location and did the same, \"Yes... yes... good.\"\n\nHe moved from one end to the other, and inspected the floor, the walls and even the ceiling by levitating above the ground at a stable height. This was what Marie observed when she entered the cottage to confer with her Master on this particular day.\n\n\"Umm... Master?\" Marie announced, expressing her bewilderment through her rising tone. \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Setting up the ritual formation. Close the door and sit there! Don't disturb me,\" he instructed as he resumed his seemingly aimless inspection.\n\n\"What is this ritual formation about?\" Marie inquired as she assumed a cross-legged, seated position on her Master's cot.\n\n\"It's in preparation for our next step- Ah shit! Can you stop interrupting me?!\" Krish yelped in frustration. He grumbled under his breath as he redid his previous check.\n\n\"Why are you being so fussy? Aren't you in the Tesseract Transformation realm? Can't you inspect all of it at once with your mana sense or something?\" Marie mocked.\n\n\"This girl- You have no idea of the kind of powers we're dealing with. If what we're about to do in here gets out into the world...\" Krish shuddered visibly at the thought.\n\nMarie squinted suspiciously at Krish and stuck out her tongue in a challenge. Krish noticed her movement and scoffed loudly, \"Stop distracting me!\"\n\n\"Fine, fine...\" Marie muttered as she lay on her back and napped - or at least she tried to. Her curiosity wouldn't allow her to relax just yet - it didn't help that her Master was extremely vocal the entire time, confirming things out loud and constantly humming in contemplation. This went on for some time, pushing Marie to her breaking point until finally a satisfied, \"Done!\" yanked her into an upright seated stance.\n\n\"So what is all this about? I don't see or sense anything,\" Marie asked with agitation in her eyes.\n\n\"You know, nowadays, I don't see you the least bit worried about your cultivation,\" Krish redirected. \"Markus and Jean both have achieved perfected resonance, the former advanced to Foundation Establishment while the latter stands at the cusp of breaking through. Do you not feel threatened or anxious at all?\"\n\nMarie shrugged and responded casually, \"Well it's going to happen to me too, eventually, right? I am fated with The Heavenly Eye, after all.\"\n\nKrish narrowed his eyes suspiciously before releasing a mirthful snort, \"I don't know whether it is a good or bad thing that you're starting to become more and more like me.\"\n\nMarie's face froze in disbelief, \"Damn it, I am, aren't I? When did this happen?\"\n\n\"It's an unfortunate side-effect of future sight, I'm afraid. When you know that things are about to happen, or have an idea that certain events will transpire, you tend to lose the motivation or urge to perform. It doesn't help that we have to constantly live on the edge, not knowing whether our actions will modulate the predetermined flow of events and come back to bite us,\" Krish explained.\n\n\"Does it only get worse? I mean, if I'm like this after learning Divination which only shows me the Transients, what will happen to me after I can observe the Constants?\" Marie probed worriedly.\n\n\"You will eventually start feeling detached from others,\" Krish answered honestly. \"You may have already noticed it happening now. While in the beginning, you had the urge to help after foreseeing negative events transpire, nowadays, you probably think twice about it. You question whether your interference is necessary or if it is better to just let them suffer through this one negative experience so that they can grow as people.\"\n\n\"That's... not good,\" Marie muttered.\n\n\"Ironic that the thing that you sought to keep your family safer is causing you to feel more detached from them,\" Krish commented.\n\n\"I won't let that happen,\" Marie responded resolutely. \"I will never- NEVER- let that happen!\"\n\nKrish revealed a sly smirk and egged the girl further, \"You don't know-\"\n\n\"NEVER!\" The cry was firm and unbending. It had the robustness of an Elder Tree capable of weathering the storms of time. Krish would have commended the girl, and felt proud even for having such a strong-headed and bold Disciple. Yet, he could not do so. How could he, when her words were literally, once again, changing the flow of fate?!\n\n'Troublesome,' he thought to himself. While he empathised with his dearest Disciple, the change she was attempting was too wild. She had no control over the waves of fate - proper control not just observing it as she was now. There would be unbound consequences to her actions, and he couldn't let that happen. Not yet. Not while he was still alive, anyways.\n\n\"Enough!\" Krish boomed. His voice was a whisper, but it echoed across the room - he had used both the wind and the mana to propagate it. \"I was only messing around with you.\"\n\nThe girl's tenacious frown softened, before mellowing out completely. She shot a cautious look at Krish, and revealed a half-hearted smile. \n\n\"In truth, I am a little antsy about my stagnant cultivation. There were very few references I could use to improve my cultivation without having to resort to trial and error, which I know that you expressly forbade,\" Marie confessed. \"I guess I just trusted that you would tell me when it was my time.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that our relationship has reached that point,\" Krish said with a fulfilled smile. \"In fact, I was waiting for the right time. I did not want to disconnect you from Guy while he was still here. He should now begin the process of securing funding and hashing out the logistics to support the True World Sect, therefore he won't have much time to teach you anything. So, it is a perfect time for us to ramp up our progress.\"\n\n\"What will I be learning, Master?\" Marie asked as she sat up straight in preparation.\n\n\"Prior to that, let me explain to you what I was doing as you came in,\" Krish answered. \"Lined within the walls, in and around the cottage, is an extremely intricate ritual formation. Its purpose is to isolate the space within from the world.\"\n\n\"Is it some kind of noise cancellation formation?\" Marie surmised.\n\n\"Everything,\" Krish corrected. \"Once active, we, for all intents and purposes, will become isolated from the world outside.\"\n\n\"Oh! So it's like an alternate plane, a pocket dimension?\" Marie hypothesised.\n\n\"Something like that. It uses the same principles that underly the pocket dimensions dubbed inheritance grounds,\" Krish expounded. He then placed one palm flat over another. \"Prior to activation, we live in this lower dimension-\" he said while waving the lower palm. \"The moment the formation gets activated, the region within its boundary enters the above plane which we can refer to as an upper dimension. No sentient being can enter this upper dimension - only exit - while it remains active.\"\n\n\"That sounds extremely complicated. You lost me with this whole lower and upper analogy,\" Marie grumbled. \"Can you repeat it again, but slower.\"\n\n\"Don't bother. It isn't time yet for you to learn its mechanisms. Your actual purpose in entering here is to attune your body to become one with the waves of fate,\" Krish redirected.\n\n\"Why is that necessary, can't I already perform divinations by deciphering these waves?\"\n\n\"That's all you can do for the moment - just see what's happening. Don't you want to be able to implement changes to the natural sequence? That is the eventual outcome after becoming one with the waves of fate. Sequentially, after you unify with the waves, you will work towards forming your Heavenly Eye. Once that is active, you will move one step closer to altering the waves around you without having to draw them into you,\" Krish continued.\n\nMarie nodded along attentively, \"This process of attuning my body, what does it involve? Will I be ingesting potions of different kinds? Will it hurt? Will this take a lot of time?\"\n\nKrish raised his right palm to stop the gregarious girl in her tracks, \"No, maybe, yes, in that order. Before we begin-\" He ejected a pulse of mana causing the atmosphere to ripple, as the ritual formation activated effortlessly.\n\n\"I must warn you that whatever I am about to teach you can not, must not, ever, EVER-\" he exhaled loudly to calm his agitation. \"I cannot stress this enough, girl. What we are about to do here MUST NEVER BE PRACTISED OUTSIDE! No matter if it was unintentional, if you blurt out a single detail, even I cannot help you avert the wrath of the universe. Heck, I fear it may cause the whole of Gaea to fall into ruin spectacularly!\"\n\n\"That sounds scary, maybe we shouldn't be doing this,\" Marie said apprehensively.\n\n\"There is no other way. And no, it's not for the lack of trying,\" Krish denied.\n\n\"Why is it so dangerous anyway?\"\n\n\"It's because we will be dabbling with something that has long become extinct from this world. This means that it should not exist - it cannot exist, since its time has already passed. If we interfere with this and by some misstep cause it to resurface, it will irrevocably shift the natural sequence of events,\" Krish answered.\n\nKrish paused to let his warning sink in. He noticed his Disciple's face cycling from anxiety to assuredness, and back again. It would be amusing were the circumstances any different.\n\n\"The way to attune the body is by altering the laws that govern it. Selected beings that are fated with the Heavenly Eye can observe the waves of fate, that much is established. But to become one with it, we have to alter the natural laws that define our biological and magical limits placed upon us. After all, nothing is more raw and close to the basis of the way this world works than fate, it shouldn't be possible for higher-order beings such as us to become unified with it. This means that we need to bend these natural laws to our will. According to Guy, this can be achieved through magic, which is a lie we tell the world using mana as a medium since it can interact with everything. We can formalise these lies using diagrammatic representations, such as spell circles. Guy has optimised this and created his Modular Spellmaking method. Now tell me, what is another way to formalise these 'lies' to the world?\"\n\n\"By that, you must be referring to the ways people cast spells,\" Marie inferred. \"If we discount spell circles, then what remains would be chanting, right?\"\n\n\"Bingo! But chanting-based spells and magics are usually predetermined. There is little advancement made in developing new spells or magics. Most efforts result in either truncating sections of older chants or shortening them. For our use, we will need to formulate longer phrases, or more elaborate lies that are so close to the truth that it becomes impossible to differentiate between them,\" Krish continued.\n\n\"How would that be possible? In order to do that we will need to be proficient in Ancient Tongue. But Ancient Tongue is-\" Marie halted in her tracks. Her eyes started to widen in shock as a realisation dawned upon her. \"No...\"\n\nKrish smirked at the girl's vocalised disbelief.\n\n\"That's right,\" he confirmed. \"We will be learning how to converse using Ancient Tongue.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-204]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":14,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 202 - Covering all of the Bases","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nGuy did not anticipate scoring an employee this early. Though it came as a surprise to him, it was a welcome one. To top it off, the employee brought with him a generous investment package. Unfortunately, Guy was unsure as to what Garlin expected with this engagement. What was Guy supposed to teach Furion?\n\n'There's still time to hash out those details,' Guy shrugged. He had other things to worry about at the moment.\n\nThe 100000 gold that Garlin planned to invest was a bounteous cushion for Guy. Although Karmin's contribution would have been sufficient and Guy could have covered the rest with his own funds, it was always a welcome addition to having more capital when starting a venture.\n\nGenerally, one must use the capital invested to its fullest potential. To that end, it was often discouraged to hold back large portions of the invested capital and leave it stagnant. This did not mean that one had to fling money willy-nilly with no proper plan, but rather to investigate and research further so that the unused capital could find some function and could lead to greater returns down the line. This was what Guy learned from his Elder Sister.\n\nAccording to her, the greatest fear of any new entrepreneur was ending up destitute - or back to where they started from. It is always a rush to suddenly see money streaming into their bank accounts after a fruitful run at schmoozing investors. Especially when one could never fathom seeing so many zeroes following a significant figure. Thus, it hurt equally, if not more, to see those digits diminishing with each purchase, be it of natural resources, human resources or machinery.\n\nThis was where she would repeat the worn-out phrase, \"You need to spend money to make money.\"\n\nTaking it at face value, one could easily scoff and dismiss the blasé and downright prodigal nature of that sentence. However, taking a step back and deconstructing it yields a crucial insight. While the invested capital remains in the bank account, it does nothing. It doesn't grow, nor does it yield anything beneficial. Sure, it is safer there as there is no chance of losing it. But by taking some time to evaluate the business opportunities and scope, one could use this stagnant capital to plant 'seeds' that could yield 'fruits' over a longer period, which in turn could exceed the capital at the time of investment. Better yet, these blooming 'plants' could proliferate and multiply! Agreed that there is always a chance of things falling apart and failing, but starting a business is anything but risk-free. As an entrepreneur, one needs to weigh these risks carefully and make smart and calculated moves. The ability to differentiate and evaluate the nature of these risks is a valuable skill that one is either born with or needs to cultivate through repeated trials and failures. \n\nGuy was anything but a risk-taker, which was why till now he'd only approached people he knew or had some connection with. Was he scared of failure, of course! Who wasn't?\n\nHowever, now he was about to step into the new ground filled with failures and dismissals galore.\n\nAs of this point, Guy had prepared most of the requirements to start a Sect. He'd secured a location, he'd decided on a name, he formulated a strategy for the Sect to sustain itself, heck he even had the backing of a mage powerhouse for safety. What remained was something of utmost importance to the Sect. In fact, without it, the Sect would not have a physical identity.\n\nThe only component left was the Sect's physical infrastructure - the buildings, setting, sanitation, and so on. A Sect could exist in name, encompassing the people that made it up. However, without a place to call their own and identify with, it would all be fleeting. Besides that, these infrastructures were necessary to organise the Sect.\n\nGuy had conferred with Twilight Village's Head, and they were all for hosting the Sect there. Even the villagers were welcoming the opportunity, primarily because having a sect in close vicinity was often beneficial for any settlement. For one, the settlement would become exempt from paying taxes to the governing body, as the Sect would now have to assume responsibility for the settlement. Although, Twilight Village didn't really pay taxes to the Duchy, which was evidenced by the decrepit nature of the transportation logistics leading to this place. So in general, this was a benefit in the Village's favour. The second reason why the villagers were for it was that when it came time to recruit new blood into the fold, sects would often pick from applicants nearby. This meant that the locals had greater opportunities. Furthermore, While sect members weren't allowed to leave their sects without cause, being in close proximity to family was always a boon.\n\nWhile the village was accommodating, Guy did not want his Sect's members to live in thatched and rickety housing, attend classes in unkempt fields or hills, wash in the spring and relieve themselves in a poorly maintained communal outhouse. He wanted to cultivate a sense of pride and belonging amongst the members. They had to feel that they were part of something greater and that they could rely on the Sect in times of need. While this relationship could be developed over time, often times a strong first impression can be used to skip that process.\n\nThis was where the new influx of capital would come into use. Guy had already performed an anticipatory land survey and drafted a rough sketch of what he wanted the Sect to look like. His initial plan was to build the essentials such as living accommodations, a lecture building, a place for practising magic, and a public bath. He even plotted out the available land on the mountainside where he wanted these buildings to be placed after clearing the forestry in that area. Guy wasn't planning to introduce the Outer, Inner and Core sect divisions and wanted to utilise experience and knowledge as the factors that generated the hierarchy, thus the theme he went for was approachable and accessible. There were no gates that blocked passage between locations, nor did he plan to implement them in the future.\n\nAs the Sect generated revenue, Guy planned to build additional buildings that offered more functions. Such as a Library so that Guy could offload all the books in his RoK for the Sect members to read. Just like hoarding money, there was no benefit in keeping knowledge locked away. Guy also wanted to create an Idea Forge Building - something like a freewheeling maker-space where members could pursue whatever caught their fancy. He would populate that building with tools and resources useful for rapid prototyping and getting what was in their minds into reality. Guy wanted to establish multiple specialised Research Buildings, where members could pursue their interests in any field of study. They could investigate the wonders of nature in all its forms, biology, physics, chemistry and so on, whatever caught their fancy.\n\nGuy had many such ideas in his mind but was lacking in the resources to implement them. But with this new influx of cash, Guy could extend from the necessities and requisition for some of the more specialised buildings like that Library and the Idea Forge.\n\nWhat followed that day, and lasted for half a week, were a series of quotation inquiries from a myriad of different construction companies established in Radiant City. Before contracting a company to realise his Sect, Guy had to first find one that could cater to his needs at a realistic price. Even if he was quite literally swimming in money, Guy was an ardent believer in frugality. Rather, he believed that it was unnecessary to spend more than what was required - something hard to find amongst children of the rich. It was a personality built through experience roaming around the more impoverished parts of the world\n\nNeedless to say, finding a suitable contractor was an onerous task, which Guy despised. The first few he visited happened to only cater to the high-end market segment. They didn't even let him get past the welcoming room. The ones that followed were more receptive, but started to flounder and inflate their ask as he started to put forth his ideas and requirements. To an extent, Guy understood their apprehension. After all, some unknown bloke from an unknown village asking to build a Sect with so many requests ought to raise some red flags.\n\nThere were just too many expenditures the contractors had to endure such as transporting the resources to the required location, storing those resources, hiring and transporting builders, and so on. Even with Guy's exhaustive promises and more than thorough contracts, those old souls with years of experience in their back pockets were quick to dismiss him either upfront or with an unmanageable bill.\n\nIt was the new and upcoming builders that offered manageable quotes. Guy wanted to use the same builder for all of the buildings to preserve a common signature. Thankfully one upcoming company, Blue's Constructions (a rather simple name given the owner was last-named Blue), took on the project along with all of Guy's requests. Guy then contracted two other companies, Dream Builders (whose owner was last-named Dream), and Brave Infrastructures (whose owner's wife was first-named Brave) to build a proper road and logistics for sanitation and necessities respectively. Of course, the latter two were of greater importance, since having a serviceable road would augment the ease with which the building resources could be transported back and forth.\n\nDuring this time, Guy also managed to lock down the investments from Karmin and Garlin, amounting to a generous 250000 gold coins from them both, with Guy adding his own whopping 250000 gold coins to balance their investment so that he could secure the 51% of his company's majority shares. Though public trading and limited liability companies didn't exist in this world, it never hurt to be careful and cover all bases. After all, business isn't built on trust, but on benefits.\n\nOverall, within a hectic month, Guy managed to set the development of his Sect into motion. Hopefully, within the coming three months, it would all be finished just in time for them to attend the Solar Sect Alliance Conference in the Empire's capital to officially establish the True World Sect.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-203]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":15,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 201 - Securing an Investment and Gaining an Employee","n":0.316},"1":{"v":"\n\"This is fantastic,\" Garlin praised while pointing at the varied instances of graphs peppered across the report. \"It so accurately encapsulates everything I want to know, without me having to sit down and deconstruct pages upon pages of indecipherable text and numbers.\"\n\n\"What are these images?\" He added while glancing between a pie, bar and line graph conveying three different sets of data.\n\n\"They're called graphs. As you so rightly said, they are pictorial representations of data,\" Guy affirmed.\n\n\"Wonderful! Did you invent these graphs?\" Garlin responded, but then he caught himself and bit his tongue. \"Apologies, I understand if these are trade secrets of some kind.\"\n\nGuy waved his hand casually and said, \"To answer your first question, I wasn't the one who invented them. I do teach about them, though.\"\n\nGarlin noticed Markus nodding along and asked the boy, \"You know how to make these things?\"\n\n\"Master has taught us how to collect, process and present data in human-readable format, yes,\" Markus answered. \"Graphs and charts are included in this.\"\n\nGarlin pushed out his lower lips and nodded with an impressed expression. His eyes darted to his son who was also perusing through the report, reading the pages he had already finished. A thought sprouted in his mind at that instant, but Garlin didn't actively pursue it for the time being. After a short half-minute, he quickly reverted to the situation at hand.\n\n\"This Verum Trading Company, you intend to use it to finance the True World Sect which you will be leading,\" Garlin confirmed.\n\nUpon receiving a nod from Guy he followed up, \"To that end, I have a few questions regarding your Sect since the two will be inevitably tied together.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Guy agreed.\n\n\"I am sufficiently informed of the requirements to starting and maintaining a Sect,\" Garlin started. \"How can you guarantee that the Solar Alliance will validate the creation of your Sect?\"\n\n\"We have the support of a Tesseract Transformation realm mage,\" Guy declared openly.\n\nGarlin's eyes nearly popped out of his sockets, and his son who was gulping down a glass of water took a legitimate spit-take.\n\n\"A T-T...\" Garlin stuttered. \"Tesseract Transformation? H-HOW? WHO?\"\n\n\"I believe it would be in our best interest to not agitate them. Though I can provide guarantees of their support. If need be I can add it to the contract.\"\n\n\"Contract?\"\n\n\"Right!\" Guy snapped his finger and retrieved the second monstrous paper pile from his satchel and dropped it before Garlin. \"These documents are for our potential partnership in this venture. If you are interested in investing and holding a stake in this business, there are additional clauses,\" Guy added while sliding forward another set of documents.\n\nCompared to Karmin's response, Garlin's eyes sparkled with excitement. He rubbed his hands in anticipation and licked his right thumb in preparation for some aggressive page flipping. Guy swore that he saw the man salivating as he mouthed the clauses.\n\n\"Oh ho! Smart, smart, I would have missed that,\" the man commented with a sly chuckle. Every now and then, Garlin released a similar comment in contemplation or in commendation followed by a sound ranging from a thoughtful hum to a full-blown laugh.\n\n\"Beautiful!\" The man concluded as he finished reading the final clause. \"I could not find a single lapse or exploitable clause. Every aspect I could think of was addressed and then some. Truly a magnificent contract, this one is. Did you write this, or was a third-party consulted?\"\n\n\"I wrote it, thank you for your kind words,\" Guy replied with a wry grin. He wasn't completely used to receiving compliments, especially if what he was getting it for wasn't something he was expressly good at. Guy had seen better contracts penned down in his past life by people who were far more educated in the field than he was. This barely scratched the surface - Guy was sure that if a more ruthless capitalist with a top-notch legal team were to approach this self-admittedly haphazard contract, they could drill holes into it like a worm devouring a tasty fruit.\n\n\"I must say that I am truly impressed by... well everything, really!\" Garlin exclaimed. \"The proposed venture is robust, and based on your research, which I must say has floored me in its meticulousness, it will be profitable. Although I have yet to see some of the products your company will develop and sell, I can infer from your confidence that you have some plans in motion?\"\n\n\"That I do,\" Guy affirmed. \"I am currently in talks with Karmin Zola of The Burning Forge. Not only is he an investor, but The Burning Forge will also act as the manufacturer of our products.\"\n\n\"You got Karmin in on this?\" Garlin blurted out in surprise. The man and his company's name were on most people's lips these days. The advent of Steel had changed the market landscape, shaking it to its core. The alloy was as durable as Dwarven metal with enchanting capacity close to it as well. What really shattered the market was the affordability of the metal - it was nearly as cheap as iron for goodness’s sake! Steel weapons and armour had become commonplace in most establishments, it was just that good.\n\n\"Yes, currently, we are at the prototyping stage of a device,\" Guy added. \"The product is owned completely by Verum Trading Company. The Burning Forge only has the rights to manufacture. They don't have rights to sell it either, so a purchase of said products needs to be validated through Verum Trading Company or True World Sect,\" he emphasised immediately after. That answered a question that was about to roll off of Garlin's tongue, which was 'Why should I invest in your company if I can get it from the manufacturer?'\n\n\"That's a smart move,\" Garlin commended.\n\n\"As for your earlier question about the products in our catalogue, let me introduce you to the Gutenberg Press,\" Guy started. He then went on to give an overview of how the device worked minus excessive technical details since he recognised that his audience wasn't as experienced in this field as Karmin. That, and because he wasn't fully sure if Garlin was on-board with the business. Unlike Karmin, Guy could not get a proper read on Garlin likely due to the man's years of experience in this ruthless environment.\n\n\"I believe we can even start a publishing company after creating this product. All the while, a company under Verum's umbrella could take on publishing contracts for large-scale manufacture and sales.\" this time it was Furion who spoke up. The boy had been silent this entire time, making himself as scarce as possible. However, his eyes gained a motivated glimmer as he blurted out his ideas. \"Apart from that, instead of selling these machines, they could be leased to others at first.\"\n\n\"What is your rationale behind the decision to lease instead of sell?\" Garlin directed his son calmly. The boy jerked in surprise.\n\n\"Umm, I mean...\" Furion stuttered.\n\n\"Speak clearly,\" Garlin emphasised.\n\n\"I-If, I mean if they sell the products from the beginning, there is little guarantee that the purchaser won't open up the product and steal its designs. Leasing can help avert those problems. First, a breakdown mechanism could be installed inside the machine that causes the product to malfunction if someone opens it. Then, when the product fails to work after being put together, Verum Trading Company can impose a penalty on the buyer. Maybe a clause can be added to the leasing contract?\" Furion listed.\n\nGuy shuddered upon seeing the little capitalist's mind at work. Back on Earth, many corporations implemented such devious methods inside their own devices to avoid theft in cases where patent litigation could not be extended. Nonetheless, Guy was completely for Furion's suggestion. In this world, there were no such things as patents and copyrights. The only cases where intellectual property rights were respected occurred when guilds became involved. Such as the deal Karmin had with the Smithing and Enchanting Guild.\n\n\"You seem taken with this product,\" Garlin commented, directing it to his son.\n\n\"Well, it seems fresh,\" the boy admitted.\n\n\"What do you think of the company?\" Garlin followed up.\n\n\"The proposal presents a worthwhile investment,\" the boy answered. Although he'd spent most of his time before as an aimless scion, Furion had some knowledge of the field through following his father.\n\n\"It's decided then!\" Garlin declared. \"I will invest in Verum Trading Company. I will partner with the company for distribution. Though, I do have some conditions.\"\n\n\"We can negotiate the deal, sure,\" Guy responded.\n\n\"I am willing to invest 100000 gold coins,\" Garlin said. \"But it will be in the name of my son.\"\n\n\"What?!\" Furion shrieked.\n\n\"He will be your contact and facilitator at Dune Caravan Management. If there is anything you need doing, it will go through him and him alone.,\" Garlin continued. \"Essentially, I want him to become an employee at your Verum Trading Company.\"\n\n\"Won't that be a conflict of interest?\" Guy probed.\n\n\"It would,\" Garlin answered. \"But from the date of signing this contract, the boy will no longer be bankrolled by me.\"\n\n\"Father?\" Furion uttered in shock.\n\n\"You will live in this house, your essentials will be funded by deducting a percentage of the salary you earn from your work at Verum. You will be responsible for every other expenditure of yours from this point on,\" Garlin declared.\n\n\"Will that be a problem?\" Garlin asked Guy. But the question felt rhetorical.\n\n\"You wish to educate your son through this?\" Guy rephrased.\n\n\"I do,\" Garlin answered.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Furion here and his group of wastrels spent less than a year with your Disciple and changed completely,\" Garlin started. \"I was always intrigued by how a single boy could accomplish such a feat. But after meeting you in person, I can see your fingerprints on his personality.\"\n\n\"Markus here managed to elicit changes in my son in months, where I failed over years,\" Garlin confessed with a sorrowful frown. \"I won't be shameless and foist him upon you without remuneration. You can treat those 100000 gold coins less like an investment and more like fees to teach my boy. Treat him how you see fit, pay him what you feel is appropriate, just please do anything to fix my mistakes.\"\n\n\"Father,\" Furion said with a wavering voice.\n\n\"I made a mistake,\" Garlin continued while shaking his head, speaking to his son this time. His voice sounded aged and worn out. \"I pushed my expectations upon you without considering your feelings. You are a talented and thoughtful boy, it's just that I wasn't good enough to nurture it well.\"\n\nFurion's eyes threatened to tear up, but he quickly dabbed them and looked away.\n\n\"So, Sect Leader Larks. Do you find these conditions acceptable?\" Garlin redirected. His face had mellowed out, and there was a pleading and hopeful intonation in his request.\n\nTo that, Guy frowned and said, \"So you're basically saying that you will invest in my company if I take in a new student, for an exorbitant fee at that?\"\n\nAs Garlin nodded, Guy said, \"I don't accept.\"\n\nBefore the man's face drooped in defeat, Guy warped with a sly smile and said, \"I was here for an investment, and I will take your money as an investment. You will be eligible for the benefits that come with said investment as stipulated in the contract. Apart from that, I accept the employment of your son in Verum Trading Company in concordance with your conditions (to be amended into the contract). This employment will involve an extensive training phase which will intimate him with all the aspects of the business and will cover a wide range of skills.\"\n\nGuy extended his arm forward and concluded, \"Are those conditions acceptable?\"\n\nGarlin laughed uproariously as he interpreted Guy's words, \"We have ourselves a deal then!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-202]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":16,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 200 - Rekindling","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nHis son was Garlin's greatest disappointment, but it wasn't in the way everyone assumed. Garlin had grand hopes and dreams. He wanted to rise to a height deemed impossible for someone with his background. And he had reached the cusp of achieving it too, that time. Unfortunately, it all came crumbling around him in one fell swoop.\n\nWhen it happened, Garlin cycled through a plethora of emotions. He felt rage, that his son failed him so spectacularly. Garlin sank every single resource in his employ for his son, yet the boy couldn't present anything in return. In simple business terms, he turned out to be a loss-making investment. He then felt envious of the offspring of other families and his competitors. Why were they so exemplary, and why couldn't his son perform similarly? Finally, he felt sorrow, witnessing his dreams shatter before him. Things weren't supposed to go this way. This wasn't part of his plans. Where did it all go wrong?\n\nHis first instinct was to bring the hammer down on his son - corporal punishment. He lashed the squealing boy a few times with a whip. Every time the rope hit the boy's flesh, Garlin's heart ached. His wife pleaded that he stop, but Garlin's anger overpowered his reasoning. Near the twentieth hit, he started to question why he was assaulting his son this way. He remembered that his father used to do the same thing to him. Garlin's father was a bullock-cart driver who would help transport the villagers from the village to the nearby town. Whenever Garlin disappointed or disobeyed the man, his father would rush outside, pick up the bamboo stick used to corral the bovines and hit him with it.\n\nJust like Garlin did with Furion, his own father had high hopes for Garlin. He wanted Garlin to become a scholar and find a firm foothold in the public sector. The jobs were stable, well-paying, and reputable. But Garlin wasn't a particularly studious boy. His mind worked differently - he learned by application. Contrarily, the schools emphasised rote memorisation and hypotheticals. So, he would regularly skip school and roam around town observing the goings-on in the markets.\n\nInevitably, Garlin would get caught by his father and would have to eat a fresh serving of bamboo lashings. But it didn't dissuade Garlin from resuming his behaviour. Because while Garlin knew why his father urged him so vehemently to pursue a path of betterment, he also recognised that the path set out for him wouldn't make him happy. Besides that, he also realised that the reason his father chose this path for him was the generous boost in status that was appended to the family of the government official. His father didn't want to be affiliated with his own profession as a bullock-cart driver, so he used Garlin as a tool to that end. Much like how Garlin used Furion to achieve his own dream.\n\nThe twenty-first lash did not fall on his son's marred back. Because at that instant, Garlin realised a key fact, which was that when a person is born, an invisible line is drawn that demarcates how far they can reach in life with their autonomy. This may refer to their social standing, economic position, or even their martial strength through cultivation. To reach beyond this limit, they will have to inevitably rely on another. Just like his father did and failed, with Garlin, and just like how Garlin did and failed, with Furion. It is impossible to force someone to assist them in crossing this line without incurring some serious repercussions. Garlin's father applied force excessively, and Garlin ended up running away in the middle of the night one day. As Garlin gazed at his son's tear-filled face and his wife's grieving frown, his grasp over the whip loosened. Going down this path would guarantee that his son would resent him for life. Garlin did not want that. If he ignored this and kept on pushing, either the boy would run away just like him or in the worst-case scenario, die. Garlin did not want that either.\n\nAt that instant, Garlin's mind was set.\n\n'Am I satisfied with what I've achieved by myself?' Garlin asked himself. To that, the answer was obviously, 'Yes.'\n\nHe was rich, and his business model was self-sustaining and brought in a steady and substantial income. Did he need to take that extra step to solidify his social standing?\n\n'Not really.'\n\nGarlin released a sigh that took with it all of his ambition and drive. He'd achieved a sobering conclusion, 'There is nothing that I can do anymore.'\n\nGarlin had reached the line and was ready to settle. He stopped nitpicking over his son, he stopped caring about what the boy did after that day. It wasn't because he despised the lad. Garlin was just disappointed. He realised that if he had approached the situation differently, he could have achieved a different result. Maybe if he was a bit more hands-on and stern with his son, the boy would have a sense of responsibility. Maybe if he took the boy along with him during business trips and ventures, the boy would become more intimate with the family's occupation. Maybe if he had moderated the boy's friendships and connections, the boy would have more experience socially. Maybe, maybe, maybe... There were a lot of them, each as viable as the other, each adding to his growing disappointment.\n\nLife had reached a standstill for Garlin.\n\nThis was until his stationary cart was given an imperceptible impetus, by his son. Suddenly, the boy started to produce results. His coursework in the Academy improved, and so did his performance. Just recently, he was listed amongst the top 10 of his cohort with three of his friends who Garlin had written off as worthless.\n\nIt did nudge Garlin's depression away just a little, maybe even spark an ember of hope. It definitely got him curious to see what motivated such a change. If Garlin had learned anything in his career, it was that nothing good came for free. His son was acting differently, for which there had to be a motivating factor. More often than nought, the root cause for a youth's change was someone of the opposite sex. Surprisingly, it was not the case in this situation.\n\nThe cause for Furion's change in personality was the boy currently sitting before him, named Markus Reva. But what intrigued him more was the identity of the person sitting beside the boy, named Guy Larks.\n\nThis Guy's identity was a bit more obscure. All Garlin was aware of, or whatever he was able to unearth from his memories, was that he was a Teaching Apprentice. But the last thing he could remember was that the man was culled from his post as part of the regular process. Once that happened, both Markus and Guy disappeared. This information was obtained directly from Furion's mouth. And now, they've returned about a year later, having made significant advancements in their cultivation.\n\nThis discrepancy was setting off his innate instincts, which had turned dormant as of late. An opportunity had come knocking.\n\n\"It's nice to finally make your acquaintance, Mister Dune,\" Guy greeted with a smile. Garlin examined his posture and body language and determined that it wasn't a facade. Although it wasn't wholehearted, there was a degree of sincerity in that remark and that pleasant veneer.\n\nGarlin returned the smile and said, \"It's unfortunate that I know very little about Mage Larks. Although I am informed of Markus and his achievements.\"\n\n\"That's good enough. I haven't done anything to warrant such attention,\" Guy replied with a chuckle, \"Not yet anyway.\"\n\n\"So, what can I help you with?\"\n\nGuy appreciated the no-nonsense attitude and went straight to the point, \"Dune Caravan Management. I require the services of your company to help store, transport and deliver stock for my company.\"\n\n\"If that's the case, you could have applied directly through our managers,\" Garlin retorted casually.\n\n\"Because that would have missed you the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a business unlike any other,\" Guy responded with a mysterious flicker in his eyes.\n\n\"If it's a business unlike any other, what guarantee would I have that my investment would return a profit?\" Garlin challenged.\n\n\"Touché,\" Guy admitted. \"You must have heard a tonne of ideas that start like this from many upstarts looking to squeeze you of your money. But you see, I'm different.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Garlin smirked back.\n\n\"Because I actually did the research,\" Guy declared as he dropped another copy of the business proposal with a dramatic flair. \"You asked for guarantees? Well, Sir, I've done my due diligence and can declare with a high degree of certainty that you will not be disappointed with this investment opportunity.\"\n\nGarlin furrowed his brows and pulled the proposal towards himself. Although Garlin and Karmin were similar, as they were both successful businessmen, there was a key detail that set them apart. Karmin, at heart, was a creator - his primary affiliation was as a blacksmith. Although he had a strong business sense and insight, in some cases where his creative instincts combated with the objective market trends, he would defer to his instincts. That wasn't the case with Garlin, as he was a capitalist through and through. He built a transportation company from scratch which now encompassed warehousing and storage as well, all using his business acumen which he cultivated through repeated failures and successes. Thus Garlin's nose followed the money, in all ten out of ten cases.\n\nTherefore, compared to Karmin, he was quick to grasp the key details listed within the extensively documented report. No claim was left unsupported - there was a wide range of research and legwork put into this document which provided robust guarantees. Garlin's eye's sparkled as his finger drifted along the paper and turned the pages one after another. Within a stimulating half-hour, he had finished the report and his eyes darted over to Guy, with a reignited fire of passion burning within.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-201]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":17,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 199 - Hitting up an Old Friend's Father","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\n\"So let me get this straight,\" Furion interjected as he massaged his forehead. \"You dropped out of the Academy because your Master, Mister Larks here was, for the lack of a better word, kicked out?\"\n\n\"I mean, there's a lot of better words to describe that situation,\" Guy muttered with a bitter smile. \"Fired, let go of, dismissed, discharged...\"\n\n\"And now, you're planning to start your own Sect?\" The boy continued, ignoring that little aside.\n\n\"That pretty much summarises the situation,\" Markus affirmed.\n\nFurion released a sigh charged with a myriad of emotions and shot a suspicious gaze at the Master-Disciple duo. \"Where do I fit into all of this? Are you asking me to join your Sect?\"\n\nAt this stage, Guy stepped in, \"Financing.\"\n\nBefore Furion could speak up in denial, Guy raised his palm and expounded, \"Dune Caravan Management.\"\n\n\"That's my father's business. I don't know if I can help you there,\" Furion replied shaking his head.\n\n\"What we need is a foot through the door, that much you can do,\" Guy reinforced. He noticed the conflicted emotions flashing across Furion's face and added, \"Don't worry. It is a lucrative proposition. If you are interested, I can take you through it right now.\"\n\nFurion inhaled with a shaking breath as he mentally calculated the offer. \"No, it's fine. I owe Boss Markus too much - this is the least I can do. As you said, I can get your foot through the door, but I won't be able to help if my father decides to ignore it and brings the door down on your legs.\"\n\n\"That's more than enough,\" Guy smiled back. \"Now then, let's eat. I've booked a hearty lunch, would be a shame to not enjoy it.\"\n\nThat Furion could get behind. He'd never actually eaten at The Golden Plate before. Even though his family was rich and well off, they rarely ate out in such luxurious establishments unless it was to wine and dine a potential client or business partner. Even then, his father actively avoided The Golden Plate due to its exorbitant prices.\n\nIn fact, Furion was partly assuaged about introducing this Guy Larks to his father because the man could afford to dine him here. Just to test out the theory further, Furion made it a point to order one or two of the pricier dishes on the menu and gauged the man's facial expressions. Noticing nary a ripple, Furion was sure that one, this man was serious and two, he had a lot of money to spare. Taking money from the rich was basically business 101!\n\nFurion patted his stomach after gulping down the last sip of the Jasmine-Infused Saffron Tea and exclaimed with a hearty, \"Aaaah!\"\n\n\"That was delicious,\" he added. \"Let's get going then.\"\n\n____\n\n\"Is my father in?\" Furion inquired the rugged-looking, beast of a man guarding the door to his father's office.\n\n\"Little Boss Furion,\" the man greeted with a bow. \"Boss Dune's inside, yes.\"\n\n\"Is he busy?\"\n\n\"He told me to not let anyone in. I dunno if he's busy or not 'cause he tells me that every time, so...\" The man answered while scratching his bald head.\n\nFurion sucked in a fraught breath through his teeth as he contemplated how to progress. After a rather momentous year, Furion had finally moved into his father's good graces. Prior to the turnabout Furion executed to his worldview and persona, in large part due to Markus' intervention, his relationship with his father was quite strained. They rarely talked, and Furion always had the feeling that the man didn't really care about what happened to him.\n\nHe did use to care at one point in time, though. Many years back. His father would dote on him, and buy him everything he wanted. Reprimand him when he made a mistake, and praise him when he did something commendable. But somewhere along the way, things started to go sour and their relationship diverged. Furion didn't know why back then, and it remained that way for a very long time since. This was until Furion became properly acquainted with Markus, and changed his approach.\n\nFurion thought that by acting out and getting into trouble, he could once again recapture his father's attention. Maybe that way he would care again? But that was the false path, since every time he did get into some mischief and had his father come bail him out, Furion could feel him moving further and further away. However, after a thorough searching of his memories, Furion figured out the reason and he realised that it had to do with why his father started pushing him away in the first place.\n\nIt happened one day when his father invited a client. Furion was told that the client was special. Yet, it was only a bit later that he learned to what extent they were 'special', and just how idiotic of an understatement the word 'special' was to describe them. These clients happened to be directly related to the Emperor, with just a few degrees of separation. Clamping them down would have been a massive deal for the business and the family. Not only would it rake in a lot of potential revenue and extend their connections, but it would also offer the family an opportunity to lose the dreaded \"parvenu\" label. Furion knew that this was what his father yearned for the most. The man had earned enough money to put them in a high-up position financially, but it was still insufficient when pitted against the big hitters in society namely the ancient clans. No matter how influential and wealthy they may be, when facing the clans that basically ran the Empire, they were just ants.\n\nHowever, wealth and an endorsement weren't the only barriers to entry into highborn society. There was a third, which was where Furion fit into his father's plan. What ensures the longevity of a clan? The mages affiliated with it. Not the ones in the family's bankroll, but the ones born into it with the clan's blood coursing through their veins.\n\nFurion was the third piece of the puzzle, alas he did not know of it at that time. He was always confused about why his father hired so many personal tutors and Teachers after shelling out inordinate amounts of money. His father hoped that Furion would turn out to be talented in some way, and become the pillar that could help transition their business and family into a Clan.\n\nNonetheless, Furion failed. When it came time to display their prowess, Furion fizzled out. This was because he never took his training seriously. He was perfectly happy living a life of indulgence.\n\nAfter that instance, his father stopped paying him any attention. Although it wasn't the first time Furion had disappointed his father, it definitely became the last.\n\nFurion lived in ignorance for many years, until one day, after acquiescing to a request from Markus, things started to turn around. As Furion started to apply himself more thoroughly in his training and in the Academy, he could gradually see his father's disinterested gaze softening. An infrequent word of encouragement, a commendation here, a reward for good performance there; Furion could clearly see his father coming around.\n\nThis was why he was feeling a little anxious about what he was about to do right now. On one hand, he owed Markus, and on the other, he didn't want to agitate his father. In the end, he felt that it was wrong to go back on one's words and threw caution to the wind. He knocked on his father's office door.\n\n\"Father, it's me Furion,\" he said with a cautious yet loud voice.\n\n\"Come.\" His father answered from beyond the door.\n\n____\n\nGarlin Dune was exhausted. Nowadays, he'd close himself off in his office even if there was no work for him to do, and simply stare into the unblemished ceiling, without a thought roaming through his mind.\n\nHis company basically ran itself. There was always some work to do since people always had to transport goods between places. The logistics were unchanging, hiring the required escorts, charting the course and planning stops, all of it had turned into an automaton that no longer required his input. Garlin worked hard to get where he was. He wasn't ashamed to admit that he built the Dune Caravan Management company with his own blood, sweat and the occasional tears, and it was his proudest creation.\n\nYet why was he feeling so distraught and idle all the time?\n\nThe question was answered by a series of knocks emanating from his doors and the voice of his son, his greatest disappointment.\n\n\"Father, it's me Furion,\" the boy called out. There was apprehension in his voice - the boy required something. In fact, this was something Garlin was getting used to nowadays. When before, the boy used to act gung-ho and impertinent, he was slowly turning more polite and mature. Which did bring a smile to Garlin's face.\n\n\"Come,\" Garlin responded. He had nothing else to do anyway.\n\nThe door opened gently, and his son's chubby face poked through. The boy bowed as a greeting and inched closer.\n\n\"Sit,\" Garlin instructed. \"Speak.\"\n\n\"Umm, Father,\" the boy said with a strained smile. \"I'm... I was wondering if had some time. You see...\"\n\nGarlin growled and said, \"Speak properly.\"\n\nThe boy jerked in place and regurgitated his words, \"I brought someone who wanted to talk to you about a business deal.\"\n\nGarlin's eyes narrowed and he had to physically hold himself back from unleashing a regretful sigh.\n\n'Well, at least the boy isn't downright asking to lend money to some miscreants. I can just deny things after hearing what they have to say.'\n\n\"Fine, call them in,\" Garlin accepted.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-200]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":18,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 198 - Hitting up an Old Friend","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nMarkus was in a perpetual state of heightened awareness and anxiousness.\n\n\"Can I get you anything, Sir?\" A courteous feminine voice caused him to jolt in place. He turned to face the smiling facade of an objectively beautiful woman, garbed in a conservative yet elegant pastel-red robe. Her face was painted to accentuate her sharp features and was made to look as natural as possible. Markus figured that was the theme they were going for - sincerity. Even the woman's smile looked real - her eyes were lax with folds forming by their sides complementing her expression.\n\n\"I-I- No, thank you,\" Markus answered, swallowing an audible gulp. As he observed the woman recede out of the room and slide the door close without turning her back to him, he violently tapped his belt satchel and sighed in relief after confirming something.\n\nMarkus wasn't used to being treated this way, with such deference. Especially given where he was right now.\n\nDuring his time at the Academy, Markus had heard of a legendary restaurant in the entertainment district. In fact, he heard that it was a restaurant in name only and that in reality, it was just as grand as the Emperor's palace. Markus never got the opportunity to verify these rumours at that time, given how he had more pressing issues to contend with. So he was shocked when his Master instructed him to book a private table for Sect business. At first, he was apprehensive, he was sure that booking reservations in a restaurant most people compared to the monarch's palace would be far from trivial. Before he could voice that thought, his Master plopped a luminescent bank account token in his palm. He then instructed Markus to visit the bank and withdraw some funds to \"expedite\" the reservation.\n\nIt was when Markus pursued that side-task that the second bombshell collapsed on him. The moment he entered the bank and displayed the token, he was dragged inside by a small squadron of powerful mages who proceeded to interrogate him on how he got his hands on the token. After a rather charged inquiry, the bank performed a complete one-eighty. He was whisked out from a dreary prison-like setting to a luxurious lounge being waited on by an armada of servants and a butler ready to bring him anything he requested while they verified his transaction.\n\nDuring his wait, Markus finally understood that his Master hadn't been jesting when he repeatedly warned him about his wealth. His Master was loaded! Legitimately loaded! Markus hadn't seen that many zeroes after a number in his entire life!\n\nHe exited the bank with a small pouch filled with gold coins hidden in his satchel. The mere presence of that hot potato raised his anxiety levels to the max. Markus would intermittently tap his satchel to make sure that the coins remained there, unaware that his skittering behaviour had attracted the eyes of actual pickpockets. But before they could make their move, Markus turned a corner and arrived in front of The Golden Plate, the premier eatery in all of Radiant City, and possibly the Solar Empire. No one wanted to get caught in this neck of the woods.\n\nMarkus was so absorbed in protecting the booty that he failed to enjoy the visual before him. The Golden Plate was a marvel of modern architecture. By using marble to create intricately carved designs that evoked an imperious aura of exclusivity and wealth, it was the epitome of luxuriance. The restaurant was tall, seven storeys tall, and had balconies extending out from each floor which, if observed from above, gave the building an appearance of a blooming lily.\n\nThe first person to greet Markus was a man garbed in a formal suit and sporting a well-meaning smile. He welcomed Markus and led him to a reception area where another individual approached him and asked whether Markus had a reservation. Markus said no, to which the man immediately offered a possibility for an expedited reservation which was a bit more expensive - a bit in a similar sense to adding a bucketful of sand into a desert. Markus acquiesced since it was part of his Master's instructions and ended up paying, rather suspiciously, exactly a quarter of the gold coins in his pouch. It was exactly because the prescribed fee went down to the copper denomination in its precision.\n\nMarkus shook his head with a wry smile and followed a third individual, the woman from before who frequently greeted him and ask him for his order, to a private dining room.\n\nA few minutes after Markus settled into a seat, the doors to the room slid open. Interestingly, Markus wasn't able to hear or even sense any presence from outside the room. He figured that the area was probably lined with a multitude of formations that isolated the private dining room.\n\n\"Boss!\" A cheerful voice boomed through as the hostess moved to the side, revealing a portly young man of Markus' age.\n\n\"Furion Stoll,\" Markus greeted and approached with open arms. The two friends embraced for a brief moment and separated. Markus immediately gestured for his companion to sit down, and they began conversing.\n\n\"What happened? You just disappeared off the face of Gaea,\" the burly boy named Furion inquired as he squirmed into the comfortable cushion of his chair. \n\n\"Circumstances required my departure,\" Markus answered rather vaguely. \"How's everything going? How's the Academy? Oh, and how are Fenman, Fuegan and Fennis?\"\n\nFurion scratched his forehead and answered, \"Things are moving as they always have back at the Academy. Though, there have been some positive changes since Teacher Way took the Vice Principal position-\"\n\n\"Didn't Teacher Way just recently achieve his license? How did he pull that off?\"\n\n\"There was an inter-Academic Tournament against the Far Horizon Academy from down South, and Teacher Way and his Students pulled out some flashy victories that gained the Radiant Academy a hell of a lot of advantages,\" Furion shrugged. \"There were a bunch of other stuff as well. He achieved two 2-star licenses in Painting and Alchemy, and then boosted through to a 2-star Teaching License within a month.\"\n\nFurion frowned and commented, \"Now that I'm saying it out loud, it doesn't make much sense... What kind of a monster is he?\"\n\nHe paused to ponder on that tangent before waving his hands and continuing, \"As for Fenman, Fuegan and Fennis, those three are doing well. If you have time, we should meet up later, Boss. Hit the entertainment districts, maybe visit a brothel or two!\"\n\nFurion immediately bit his tongue and said, \"I forgot that Fuegan got hitched! His new fiancée is a firecracker. She'd murder him if he got caught sniffing around such places. And then she'd castrate us for tempting him...\" Furion gulped while suppressing a shudder.\n\nMarkus chuckled as Furion continued elaborating on the trivial goings-on back at the Academy. Although Markus held no affection or nostalgia for that hell-hole, he definitely missed those four bully-turned-friends for all the hijinks and antics they got into.\n\nIf he were being completely honest, Markus was initially averse to forming a friendship with the four greatest miscreants who tormented most people back at the Academy. The F4, as everyone called them, were one of the more prolific bullies in the Academy. Although Markus' interaction with them was sparse, it wasn't pleasant either.\n\nHowever, Master Larks told him that he should consider getting close to the F4 not to form a sincere friendship, but one that was based on a give-and-take policy. He should assume a position where he could contribute something of advantage to them, and in turn, they would involuntarily enter a favour-owing mindset when interacting with him.\n\nWhat could Markus contribute to people who could buy everything they wanted? Their family's approvals of course. After some research, stalking and spying, Markus found out that the four acted out mostly to attract their parents' attention, which was usually distracted with their own businesses. \n\nAll four were second-generation rich brats of self-made businessmen. The parents were preoccupied with growing their fortune since they had personally experienced the pain of poverty. While the heirs, who were born with everything, lacked the one thing they sorely yearned for.\n\nThus, Markus enacted his plan. Through some pretty basic social manoeuvring and suggestion, he encouraged the F4 to shift their rogue enthusiasm into their studies. By fooling them into learning stuff and applying their knowledge, their academic measurables started to rise incrementally.\n\nWithin months, they were elevated into the top ten of the cohort, which immediately granted them their parent's attention and love. And thus Markus gained four valuable favours which were implicitly NQA (No Questions Asked).\n\nToday, Markus was planning to cash in his first one for the benefit of the Sect.\n\n\"That's enough of my rattling,\" Furion threw out as he gulped down a mouthful of water to wet his parched throat from all the talking. \"So Boss, how're things with you? Anything good happen with you?\"\n\nMarkus nodded and released his control over his mana. The wave washed over Furion and nearly caused him to choke on his spit.\n\n\"Y-You broke through?\" Furion exclaimed in shock, which turned into sincere awe. \"As expected of Boss! That Gaige's been flaunting around the campus like he's hot shit. He just got lucky! Are you here to teach him a lesson?\"\n\nMarkus chuckled at the boy's enthusiasm and spirit. \"Revenge can be exacted at any point in time. The more you let it cool, the sweeter it is.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" Furion agreed while flashing a thumbs-up.\n\n\"By the way, Boss,\" Furion commented. \"Why did you call me here? Before that, how can you afford this place? Not to be disrespectful or anything, but weren't you an orphan? Wait! Did you discover your true family? Are you a descendent of some rich royals? I knew it!\"\n\nMarkus smiled wryly as his companion's overactive imagination started to bloat the circumstance exponentially with each passing second.\n\nBefore he could interrupt and explain himself, the door to the room slid open once again, and the woman proclaimed, \"The host has arrived.\"\n\n\"Master!\" Markus greeted while standing up.\n\n\"Markus,\" his Master responded with a nod.\n\n\"Master?\" Furion blurted out in confusion.\n\n\"Ah, you must be Mister Stoll, Markus's friend,\" his Master commented as he extended his arm towards Furion.\n\n\"Master?\" Furion repeated while alternating his gaze between Markus and his Master.\n\nMarkus coughed, \"Furion. Let me explain...\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-199]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":19,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 197 - Dabbling in Legalese","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nKarmin had to physically hold himself back from hugging the man in front of him and kissing him on the lips. As a businessman, Karmin quickly envisioned the possibilities professed by the device presented by Guy. Using his knowledge of blacksmithing, he could confirm that what was proposed was within the limits of reality and was possible to materialise.\n\nGuy noticed that Karmin was on the cusp of tipping over in favour of the investment and decided it was time for the coup-de-grace.\n\n\"This device is a trailer of what my business aims to output. Machines and solutions that can simplify overlooked problems that prevail in society. Let us take a step back and look forward in time. A decade later, more than 25% of publishers in the world utilise this Press to produce their books. With the ease of manufacture and distribution, more and more people have access to information and the average literacy of the population increases. Those of the lower class that believed they could never escape their station due to the educational barrier blocking their advance no longer have to worry about their illiteracy, since just about anyone can learn to read and write with a small expense of a few copper coins to purchase a book that teaches them how to read.\"\n\n\"Why would you buy a book to learn to read?\" Karmin blurted out.\n\n\"Pictures,\" Guy answered. \"See! This opens up a new avenue altogether. Books that teach people to do things. A century into the future, anyone can write and publish a book. A farmer could write a book teaching others how to tend to different crops. An adventurer could write a book teaching others of the fundamentals to survive in the wilderness.\"\n\n\"Solutions that can change the future,\" Guy highlighted. \"You can expect more of those from the company.\"\n\nKarmin nodded subconsciously, but his mind was already dwelling on the future as Guy indicated. Except, he wasn't envisioning all those philanthropic outcomes, he was mentally counting the gold coins spilling into his coffers.\n\n\"This... Okay!\" Karmin declared. \"You've convinced me. I am prepared to invest in this company.\"\n\n\"Wonderful! Now comes the often unpleasant part of this interaction: the negotiation,\" Guy said as his enthusiasm dampened. \"I have prepared a preliminary contract to cement our agreement. Please have a read and if you have any problems, we can flesh out the details further.\"\n\nGuy produced another stack of papers, much thicker than the proposal, and plopped them in front of Karmin. As he read them, Karmin's expression turned complicated, not because he had an issue with the contents, but rather because the content was extremely thorough and tackled every question he could and couldn't think of.\n\n\"Verum Trading Company is affiliated with and a subsidiary of the True World Sect. At the time of drafting this contract, the Sect Leader and primary representative for Verum Trading Company are Guy Larks. The Burning Forge is owned by and operated by Karmin Zola. Legally, The Burning Forge and Karmin Zola are a singular entity.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"The Burning Forge will be the sole manufacturer for Verum Trading Company's products for the duration of ten years following the validation of this contract. However, the patents and rights for the products will be fully owned by Verum Trading Company. The Burning Forge may not sell or distribute products owned by Verum Trading Company to external parties. Violation of this clause will be subject to the following repercussions...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"As an investor, Karmin Zola can choose to receive earnings equivalent to the percentage invested. These earnings will be in the form of annual dividends, which are percentage distributions of the profits accumulated by the business yearly. Alternatively, Karmin Zola can opt to reinvest the dividends into Verum Trading Company for an increase in owned stake. The stake ownership is calculated using the following criteria...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Every new product developed by Verum Trading Company that is to be manufactured through The Burning Forge will be subject to another contract that will determine the cost of goods, resources, and so on. These contracts will be active for the duration of the manufacturing rights aforementioned and will be subject to renegotiation once the manufacturing rights held by The Burning Forge have lapsed. Verum Trading Company, and by extension the True World Sect, will be guaranteed a complementary unit of every new product manufactured by The Burning Forge.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"The stake for Verum Trading Company will be held by Karmin Zola, owner of The Burning Forge, till their termination. It is non-transferable. If Karmin Zola wishes to transfer their stake to a third party, the recipient must be able to purchase the stake according to its price, which corresponds to the percentage invested scaled to the valuation of the company at that point in time. Transfer of stake between individuals will require a confirmation from all other stakeholders.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nKarmin dabbed the sweat from his forehead as he averted his eyes from the stack of text. He still had a quarter of the stack left. He had seen many contracts in his lifetime, this was by far the most... everything!\n\n\"This is quite verbose,\" Karmin commented. That was putting it lightly. Karmin had never seen a contract so exhaustive!\n\n\"If we're doing this, we're going to do this right. Although we are closely acquainted, I wish to separate our personal and professional relationship. This contract is my way of showing my sincerity in seeking your assistance in this matter as a successful businessman,\" Guy explained with a forthright tone. When it comes to money, he had learned that it was often best to draw clear lines. Misunderstandings stemming from mishandling of money often lead to the worst kinds of conflicts, and most of the time the damages sustained through these conflicts - relationship-wise - were ones that never healed. Therefore, for this agreement, Guy put together a meticulous contract after crawling through the RoK for examples, leaving absolutely no room for misunderstandings or contention.\n\nKarmin coughed lightly to mask his embarrassment and said, \"It will take me some time to go through this. Don't get me wrong, I am leaning toward this partnership, it's just that, as you said, we need to take this seriously and approach this collaboration with a purely business-oriented lens.\"\n\nGuy smiled back, expressing his satisfaction, and said, \"That's good to know. No issues! I strongly urge you to go through this contract and mark any amendments you wish to implement, and we shall work out those kinks accordingly. I shall be in Radiant City for a month at least, I hope to produce a working unit of the Gutenberg Press within that time so that it can hit the markets as soon as possible. It definitely helps to have a demonstrative unit when convincing potential buyers.\"\n\nKarmin affirmed and returned an equally satisfied smile, trying his hardest to stop his lips from quivering as he anticipated the long hours that will be spent deconstructing this beast of a contract.\n\n____\n\nAs Guy turned a corner into an alley after exiting The Burning Forge, he doubled over onto his knees and released a long sigh of relief. This was his very first business pitch, and he was freaking out!\n\nFrom the beginning, Guy wanted Karmin to take him seriously and consider investing from a professional standpoint. He knew that Karmin had hitched his wagon with Guy from way back, and he would readily agree to anything as long as it wasn't flagrantly disadvantageous. In fact, Guy had a hunch that Karmin would still agree even if it was disadvantageous, albeit begrudgingly. Guy could have very easily asked Karmin to turn The Burning Forge into the Sect's finance front. It would have been easy to do, heck Guy could have \"urged\" Karmin to do so with his unique powers if the man was teetering towards a disagreement. But Guy didn't want to do that.\n\nFor the True World Sect to sustain itself and succeed, its source of income needs to be robust and legitimate. Guy couldn't rely on others for this, it had to be purely through his own initiative.\n\nSpearheading innovation. That was the name of the game. Developing novel products that made life easier for people and businesses. Guy could sell inventions that existed in his past life that didn't exist here. It was something most, if not all transmigrators attempted and succeeded in doing. But as established earlier, Guy knew that it wasn't a sustainable venture.\n\nWhat use was having a horde of innovative and inquisitive minds if he was the only one outputting ideas? The Sect was basically a think tank filled with endless creativity. If Guy taught the members well, they could in turn innovate and develop new products and solutions that could be monetised. Verum Trading Company would act as a platform for them to prototype, market and float their ideas. This way, the kids would learn to apply their knowledge and gain motivation from achieving tangible results.\n\nGuy didn't have to participate in innovation actively, he could light the fuse with a few key products like the Printing Press, which he rightly affiliated with the original inventor. Down the line, Guy planned to create the Lathe and the Milling machine as well, the two fundamental machines that revolutionised the modern industry. With the clause in the contract which awarded the Sect with a complimentary unit, Guy planned to teach the Sect members how to use these machines so that they could fast-forward innovation and prototype their ideas quickly.\n\nGuy had laid out an elaborate plan of action to raise his Sect and turn it into an unshakeable monolith. That was the only way he could implement meaningful changes on a global scale. The business would play a huge role in this goal.\n\nWith manufacturing out of the way, once Karmin signed the contract, Guy had to now worry about distribution. The Sect's business could not build a brick-and-mortar store in commercial districts, after all. And no business would go out of their way to a rural village to buy goods they had never heard of and transport them where they were needed. Verum Trading Company had to deliver their products to the customer somehow.\n\nSurprisingly, Markus came through on this matter. Guy walked briskly through a few alleys and roads and finally reached a rather high-class restaurant called The Golden Plate in the city's entertainment district.\n\nThis area was usually frequented by the wealthier segment of the market and was thus clean and rarely crowded. There were regular patrols by the local law enforcement, therefore crime was a rare occurrence here. In fact, being caught by law enforcement would be the best-case scenario for any criminal in these parts.\n\nGuy's purpose here was to meet his second possible investor, and a prospective distribution channel for the Verum Trading Company.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-198]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":20,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 196 - Blast from the Past (from Another World)","n":0.316},"1":{"v":"\nGuy's elder sister was an ambitious businesswoman. She was tenacious and ruthless and built her entertainment empire from scratch with no help from the family. It was a task she took upon herself to prove that she was more than just the Larks name.\n\nShe always had the entrepreneur's spirit and a natural-born insight unlike any other. She was quick to observe the changes in market trends while working as an intern in a record label company.\n\nAfter two years of accumulating experience and knowledge, she set off to create her own unique company that recruited talent and trained them to thrive in the perilous industry. She took a page from the systems employed in the East and tweaked it slightly to achieve great success.\n\nFor one, the West encouraged individuality and self-expression. Yet because of this mentality, the artists were forced to set out on their own and find opportunities by themselves. Although they could employ agents, the support they received from that side was limited to finding and landing auditions, negotiating pay, and so on. There was little to no support for growth and development, which was available in the agencies of the East.\n\nWhen an actor failed an audition, or if an album flopped, they would rarely receive tangible feedback on how to improve. There was also little training on how to handle their fame and the media. His sister's goal was to create an agency that could fill in that role. To act as the incubator that nurtured artists and supported them through their journey. \n\nGuy's sister pitched her company to many investors, but most did not believe in her vision. They figured that investing heavily into unestablished talent was futile since they would simply jump ship when offered a better contract, which was understandable. But his sister did not give in regardless of the many denials she faced. Ultimately, one woman felt moved by his sister's proposal and she offered her support. His sister would later marry this woman, but that was a separate story.\n\nDuring her time pursuing investors, his sister had conducted unbelievably thorough research of the market. In the process, she recruited Guy's assistance to help her put together the business proposal. Guy was more than willing to help his sister for free, but she insisted on paying him saying, \"Until I can prove my mettle, you aren't my brother. I am no Larks. I am simply an acquaintance hiring your services.\"\n\nThrough this favour, Guy learned a great deal about business management from his sister. He accumulated many valuable skills that he never thought he would ever use again until he died, transmigrated, and resolved to create his own sect.\n\nGuy followed his sister's method by the book to put together the business proposal for his venture. He spent two weeks moving from place to place, stalking outside stores and shops and even interviewing many folks both willing and irritated. It was hard, but it was necessary. \n\nThis is because no one wants to willingly give their money to others. The rich may throw their wealth willy-nilly, but that is only because they know that the expenditure will net a guaranteed return immediately. But such guarantees aren't always present when investing.\n\nWith investing, what they get are probabilities. Probability of successfully recouping the amount invested, the probability of amplifying their invested amount, and the dreaded probability of making a loss. Based on how these probabilities are spread, an investor will decide to invest or pass on a proposal.\n\nThe probabilities are generated in large part based on the data presented to the investors, and in minor part based on the entrepreneur's drive and vision for their business. A confident entrepreneur with a losing business model is the same as a money-making business model with a half-hearted or nervous entrepreneur. However, the former will be kicked out of the room immediately, while the latter can salvage the situation by selling their business model to the investor and working as an employee in the business.\n\nTo convince Karmin, Guy had to show that he was motivated by his business, and he had to present to him the data that supported the need for his business.\n\nAfter collecting a wide range of raw data through primary research, Guy took half a week to compile everything into human-readable form. At this point, he was grateful that he had his computer in the RoK. With the help of the spreadsheet program, the word processor, and the printer, the process was trivial. His efforts definitely paid off as Karmin's eyes sparkled and latched on to the colourful graphs presenting the data visually. Rather than seeing abstract numerics sprawled across the page, graphs are the easiest way to make sense of data so that even a layman can understand it.\n\n\"While you bring forward good points, I am confused as to what your business will do. As in, what is the tangible output from this company?\" Karmin asked.\n\n\"Good question. To answer it, I would like to propose to you a series of questions, please entertain me,\" Guy requested as he pulled out a textbook from his satchel.\n\n\"This is the 'Compendium of Common Metals and Alloys' from the Guild's library. I borrowed it for today's presentation. Only the Guilds have a copy of this book, why is that?\"\n\n\"Because it is expensive to print. And it regularly gets updated,\" Karmin answered.\n\n\"True, so if I wanted to purchase this book, how much would I have to spend?\"\n\n\"At least a few gold coins. No one really bothers to purchase these,\" Karmin responded. \"You would have to pay scribes to copy over the content and artists to copy the illustrations. It's a huge hassle.\"\n\n\"What if I told you that it was possible to reduce the cost to a few silver coins?\" Guy probed mystically.\n\nKarmin narrowed his eyes and nearly snorted at what he perceived was a joke. But when he noticed Guy's confident smile, he realised that the man was being serious.\n\n\"You're kidding!\"\n\n\"I am here today to propose to you the first product envisioned and designed by Verum Trading Company, the Gutenberg Press,\" Guy declared. He then reached into his satchel again and pulled out a scroll the length of his forearm.\n\nAs he unfurled it, he revealed a descriptive diagram that presented, in Karmin's eyes, a grandiose machine that could take in sheets of paper and output uniform text.\n\n\"This machine utilises a mechanism that we call the Gutenberg Mechanism to stamp text arranged in proper order in the form of blocks, into blank paper,\" Guy explained. \"It utilises the same techniques people use to stamp their identity in official forms.\"\n\n\"Can you explain how this process works?\" Karmin inquired as he squinted at the paper.\n\n\"These are called letterpress blocks that contain singular letters extending outwards and reflected. To manufacture these, you can use casts with molten bronze. We can customise these and generate a myriad of typesetting fonts to match the nature of the text. For instance, this textbook is informative and needs to be devoid of flagrant embellishments. To accomplish that, we can utilise the following font which is called Simple Serif or Simple San Serif. For more vibrant text, we can use fonts like this one which I call Cursive,\" Guy explained while pointing out sections on the scroll.\n\n\"The blocks can be arranged in a line, note that the text is backwards since when you print it the imprint reflects. You can arrange multiple lines to form a page.\"\n\n\"This seems to take a lot of time,\" Karmin commented. \"Wouldn't it be easier for a scribe to write out the page?\"\n\n\"That would be true if the intention is to write one page at a time. But the way this press works is by printing out multiple batches all at once. You see, after typesetting a page, all you need to do is affix it here and dab the ink over it like so. Finally, you place the paper over this and bring down the lever of the Gutenberg mechanism. After a few seconds, the lever can be pulled back and voila!\" Guy finally gestured at the last diagram. \"You get a completely typeset page immediately. While typesetting takes time, printing takes barely a minute. You can print over a hundred copies of a page within an hour. Then you set it for the next page and repeat the same. Within a week you can output over a hundred copies of a book with only four people working the machine. The best part is that every book will be exactly the same. And if the workers are properly trained and educated, the margin of error is low. As a businessman, you should already be able to envision the benefits of this machine.\"\n\nKarmin nodded enthusiastically as his eyes widened into saucers. \"You no longer have to worry about variations in the script due to differences in scribe habits. Heck, you don't have to hire droves of scribes in the first place! The unbelievable fact is that this miraculous machine doesn't even rely on magic or mana, so just about anyone can use it.\"\n\n\"This machine!\" Karmin exclaimed as financial mathematics rattled off in his mind. \"How much will it cost to manufacture?\"\n\n\"Through my research, I found that the issue does not lie in the cost of the materials but rather the time and expertise. Most of the parts needed to materialise this require some intricate tool work for which we will need some expert blacksmiths and woodworkers, which I am sure you have connections with. I have developed blueprints for these parts, which I will share in due time. But before that, I will need to hear your opinion and decision on the proposal,\" Guy concluded.\n\n\"So, what do you say?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-197]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":21,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 195 - Business Proposal","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Teacher Larks, you didn't have to come all the way here,\" Karmin greeted jollily while reaching forward for a sincere hug.\n\nAs Guy embraced the man in return, he noticed a few changes in his demeanour. For one, Karmin appeared much, much stress-free as opposed to the last time. It was also evident that he had put on a little weight and his face had gained more colour.\n\n'It looks like business is good,' Guy thought to himself. If only he checked his bank account first, he would realise just how much of an understatement that comment was. The Burning Forge was raking in an ungodly amount of money. After people realised the ubiquity and base strength of steel, they started to adopt it everywhere. Mercenary corps, sects, clans, businesses, heck even the Royal Family placed orders for steel weapons and armours, both enchanted and regular.\n\nIt got so out of hand that Karmin was forced to loosen the restrictions on the purchase and sale of the alloy, which was preceded by an extremely heated negotiation with the Head of the Smithing and Enchanting Guild. Although a few concessions were made, there were no substantial losses. The Burning Forge, and Guy, still held the patents for the alloy and would receive a set percentage share from every unit mass of steel sold through the Guild and its channels. The guild and its members could sell steel as ingots and as forged weapons and armours, but enchanting was only allowed through The Burning Forge's stamp.\n\nThanks to these events, Guy's account had ballooned significantly, and the bank had taken the initiative to upgrade his status to VVIP. Of course, Guy did not know of this yet since his registered address had expired and they could not correspond with him.\n\n\"Since it was I who needed a favour, it was only right that I approached you. Besides that, I don't qualify for the 'Teacher' title. You can just call me Guy,\" Guy said while waving his hands.\n\n\"If that is what you prefer, then let's be casual. I believe we've earned this given our business entanglements. You can be comfortable with me and call me Karmin,\" the man responded jovially and gestured for Guy to take a seat. They were currently in The Burning Forge's office in Radiant City. Guy travelled to the commercial hub of the Maika Duchy to accomplish many things in preparation for setting up his Sect. One of which would require the involvement of backers with wide sales channels, an established and substantial business, and an open mind with the willingness to take risks.\n\n\"I received your mail earlier, it indicated that you wanted to discuss something?\" Karmin directed the conversation. After getting to know Guy, he understood that just like himself, the man wasn't a fan of useless small talk.\n\n\"That is true. Before I get to that, though, I would like to talk about a few prerequisite details that will support my request,\" Guy responded and proceeded to explain his goal of starting a Sect.\n\nNow that Guy had a name for his Sect as well as a location where it could be established, he started to move down the checklist and addressed the next order of business which was income. A sect needed money to sustain itself. Escort missions were a sect's bread and butter, but those were hard to come by since most businesses preferred established sects instead of hedging their bets on fledgelings. Those that did commission new and less renowned sects wouldn't be able to pay as much. So Guy was sure that his sect wouldn't be able to recoup its expenses by relying only on escort missions. Furthermore, those missions were often dangerous and he wasn't sure if his students were strong enough to handle them so soon.\n\nAn alternative that did not involve underage kids putting their lives on the line was through conducting business. This could involve providing a specialised service or selling unique products.\n\nTo that end, Guy found through research that there were exceedingly complex steps involved in starting a business affiliated with a Sect. Especially within the Solar Empire, where the market was heavily controlled, there were a plethora of requirements that needed to be fulfilled. The most stringent of said requirements was that any company spawned off a Sect could not have physical stores within any commercial districts - purchases must be made directly with the Sect. To elaborate, if Guy created a company that provided a good or service, customers could only purchase that good or commission the service by contacting the Sect's sales representative. They could not go to a storefront that acted as the point-of-sale. This was a massive disadvantage because it automatically removed the primary mode of promotion in this world. Essentially, it turns Sects into e-commerce businesses, but without the internet.\n\nApart from this, Guy was faced with other roadblocks common to new businesses, most of which could be solved by building lucrative connections. This could be accomplished by bringing in investors. Investors hold a stake in a business and have an active motivation to assure its success. This was Guy's purpose in approaching Karmin.\n\n\"I see,\" Karmin hummed once Guy finished speaking. \"So I am guessing that your request has something to do with your Sect's possible revenue stream?\"\n\n\"That is correct,\" Guy affirmed.\n\n\"So?\" Karmin inquired as he leaned into his table.\n\nGuy smiled and reached into his bag, retrieving a half-inch thick, A4-sized bound stack of papers and placed it in front of Karmin.\n\n\"What's this?\" Karmin asked with furrowed brows as he pulled the stack towards himself.\n\n\"The business proposal,\" Guy explained.\n\nKarmin glossed the cover page, \"Verum Trading Company? What's Verum?\"\n\n\"It means 'truth' in an extinct language,\" Guy answered. \"If you peruse the Executive Summary on the subsequent page, you will see that my sect is called 'True World Sect'. Hence, to establish a relationship between the company and the Sect, I decided to name the company as such.\"\n\nKarmin hummed and proceeded to read through the proposal. Contrary to his expectations, going as far as to exceed them, the report was thorough. Extremely so. It started with a description of the company's purpose.\n\n\"It says here that, 'The Verum Trading Company seeks to fulfil gaps in the market that the public isn't fully aware of.' This sounds a little vague, can you expand on it?\"\n\n\"Surely. There is a saying where I come from that 'Necessity is the mother of creation.' People seek out solutions and invent when a vital need is found unfulfilled. People built carts when the need to travel over long distances while transporting heavy goods was found unfulfilled. People built roads when the need for said travel grew perilous and unstable,\" Guy started. He then shifted his tone and professed a few counterpoints, \"But what happens when a large portion of these needs get fulfilled? This is where we encroach upon the territory of the 'wants'. This is a slippery slope since satisfying wants is not crucial, but merely enjoyable. People needed clothing to protect themselves from the environment, but they wanted fashion to express their individuality and in some cases flaunt their wealth. But that is beyond the scope of our discussion.\"\n\n\"Ironically, it is by satisfying wants that businesses thrive. This is also what separates the lucrative businesses from the ones that just get by. Through my research over the past few weeks in the commercial districts of Radiant City and Wayward Town, I found out that most, if not all businesses that cater to consumer 'wants' do so exclusively with a market segment that has an excess of disposable income and savings. I would like to draw your attention to-\" Guy leaned forward and turned the pages of the report. \"-here. On this page, I have described my observation comparing a Carpenter's Shop in Wayward Town against a Furniture Emporium here in Radiant City. In the Shop, 88% of the clients were of a segment from the low-income bracket. On a side note, I've defined my criteria for such labels on the reference page at the front. 8% were from businesses looking for cheap and disposable furniture, while the rest were simply miscellaneous. However, the Emporium exclusively catered to a wealthy clientele. And by wealthy, I mean in both money and power. In fact, I saw them kick out a man who had the finances to purchase their products but lacked sufficient fame.\"\n\n\"How did you get this information?\" Karmin asked incredulously.\n\n\"I stalked outside the stores and took surveys. The people visiting the Shop were more upfront with their answers. For the Emporium, I had to rely solely on my observations, hence they may be skewed or biased - just a fair warning,\" Guy clarified. \"But I want to point out that the Emporium made a heck of a lot more out of their sparse sales as opposed to the carpenter with his apprentices who outputted more units per order. I also noticed that the variety of products sold by the carpenter was sorely lacking, while the Emporium had a myriad of products with varying designs.\"\n\n\"Well the Carpenter's clients don't really seek such ornamentations,\" Karmin pointed out.\n\n\"Exactly!\" Guy said while snapping his fingers. \"Why is that?\"\n\n\"Why is what?\"\n\n\"Why is it that the Carpenter's clients don't seek these ornamentations? Why is everyone - by that I am referring to the large segment of the market that falls under the middle to low-income brackets - suddenly just content with mediocrity and living a mundane life?\" Guy professed animatedly. \n\nGuy decided to pull a few tricks he learned from his sister in his past life and blasted Karmin with a declaration that shook the man to his core.\n\n\"Everyone wants,\" he said with a weighty voice that started to crescendo as he spoke. \"Everyone wants, but most lack the frame of mind to pursue it. People believe that certain excesses are beyond their station - that they are solely for the rich and powerful - and that they don't deserve it. But the Verum Trading Company aims to disprove this mentality. A farmer can enjoy the luxury of owning their very own chaise lounge without having to feel heartache over shelling out an inhuman amount of currency. And similarly, a carpenter need not fret over being unable to fulfil that demand should the farmer approach them.\"\n\n\"Every need or want can be fulfilled by ingenuity and creativity. This is Verum Trading Company's motto. We seek to output products that address the overlooked gaps in the market that are reservoirs of wealth just waiting to be tapped.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-196]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":22,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 194 - The Same Person","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nThe class was dismissed and everyone went their way, except for Jean who remained in place for a while, silently chewing on her lips with a faint conflicted expression flashing forming on her face.\n\n'Maybe another time?' She concluded unassuredly. Mister Larks had forgotten about the appointed discussion amidst the hectic naming debate. She wanted to remind him once again but held back her tongue at the last minute because she was worried. Fear was brewing inside of her.\n\n#Pathetic wimp!#\n\n*Stop agitating her!*\n\n#Shut up!#\n\nJean shook her head to silence the voices assaulting her mind. She exhaled a troubled breath and lamented silently. She'd taken a large step forward, but things were starting to regress. She was scared, but she didn't know how to bring it up in front of Mister Larks. She empathised with his decision to create a Sect, but she also didn't want to disappoint him by being a hindrance.\n\n'What do I do?' She sighed. Amidst her anguish, the voices started to pick up steam once again. She had to spend a more significant portion of her consciousness to appease them both. As she did so, she entered a preoccupied trance and her body ran on autopilot. She walked, and walked, and walked onwards, uncaring of where her feet took her. She continued moving at a steady and mechanical pace until suddenly, a myriad of familiar fragrances stormed her senses.\n\nUnwittingly, through some form of subconscious muscle memory, she found herself in the garden Grace tended to by the spring.\n\nJean bent down and inspected the flowers that were blooming in a systematic grid with a gentle touch. Everything was in perfect order, growing as well as it could, given the limitations Grace had to work with.\n\n\"You're in late?\" Grace's voice commented from behind her. Jean jolted her neck and addressed the garden's owner and caretaker with as sincere of a smile as her face could muster. Jean then acknowledged Grace's question with pursed lips and an inattentive nod. It was close to sunset - Jean didn't usually visit the gardens during this part of the day. She mostly frequented the gardens early in the morning.\n\n\"If you're here now, it means something's bothering you,\" Grace deduced accurately. Once again, Jean was completely floored. There weren't that many people in this world who could read her so easily like a book, especially after her treatment. In fact, she could count the number of people with just one hand- no- just two fingers. The first, of course, was her teacher, Mister Larks. The second, surprisingly, was Matron Reva.\n\nGrace noticed Jean's eyes faltering and her lips moving up and down. Whatever the girl was struggling with, was something she found difficult to vocalise. No matter, \"Help me survey the garden first. Tell me what's on your mind after. Okay?\"\n\nJean nodded and moved to assist Grace as they transitioned from one plant to the other. Something Jean learned through her interaction with Grace was that the woman was uncannily learned in botany with both the mundane and magically charged plants. There were a few plants in the garden like the Bluegleam Fungus, which required highly specific mana dense and damp environments to grow, but were surprisingly thriving. Jean knew for a fact that it was difficult to grow these without one being a mage themselves and having access to extremely specific soil conditions. But Grace had ingeniously used the nature of other plants growing in its vicinity to her advantage. The fungi were cultivated in an indentation of a tree with Sweltering Moss growing around it, which is known to agitate the plants it grows on and discharges the water stored within them to create an extremely humid ambience. The tree was also hosting the notorious Sanguineous Creeper, which is known to consume blood to generate highly potent mana that is stored within its vines for an extremely long period. None of these was naturally found in this part of the forest, which meant that Grace had transplanted them here. To be able to then maintain these plants in such a bounteous state without being a mage definitely raised Jean's respect for the woman.\n\n\"That's the last of it!\" Grace declared with a satisfied grunt while clapping her hands to dislodge as much dirt as possible. \"Come, let's wash our hands. Dora made some soap with a sandalwood infusion. I don't know how Guy got his hands on such expensive materials, but damn is it worth it!\"\n\nGrace waved a soap bar which she retrieved from her satchel hanging over her shoulders and called Jean over to the spring.\n\n\"Hmmm! Smells divine,\" Grace commended while taking in a deep breath from her cupped hands as the duo walked back to the orphanage.\n\n\"Now, tell me. What's eating at you?\" Grace asked casually.\n\n\"I'm just scared,\" Jean answered without hesitation. After settling her apprehension through the mundaneness of tending the plants, her mind was sufficiently unburdened and open to sharing.\n\n\"Why?\" Grace retorted with a mild frown laced with concern.\n\n\"Mister Larks is planning to create his own sect. He's calling it the True World Sect,\" Jean started. \"It's great! I agree with his vision and goals, they are admirable, but...\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\nJean slowed her steps and lowered her gaze to the ground. Noticing a loose stone, she raised her leg and kicked it hard - with all of her mana concentrated on it. Like a wild stallion released from its reins, the stone burst forward with unparalleled vigour. \"But, I'm worried that there won't be any place for me there. I'm scared that I will no longer be able to learn under Mister Larks, with Senior Brother and Big Sis. I'm terrified that I will be all alone again, left to my thoughts.\"\n\nThough her face remained unperturbed, Grace could feel the unshackled sorrow laced within those words. The girl was visible shaking, trying her hardest to release her pent-up emotions but failing miserably at it. Grace stepped towards her trembling form and gently cradled the girl's head into her welcoming bosom. With another hand, she patted Jean's back.\n\n\"It's okay,\" Grace murmured with a warm purr. \"Let it out. Let it all out.\"\n\nA tense few seconds passed before - just like a pressure cooker releasing its accumulated steam - a long cathartic exhale escaped from Jean's mouth and nose.\n\n\"A Sect is a Mercenary Corp at heart,\" Jean said with a low whimper. \"That's how they function and make their money. But Matron Reva, I don't want to hurt anyone! I just can't do it. But I don't want to be kicked out because I cannot contribute to the Sect.\"\n\n\"Is that what you're worried about?\" Grace asked in disbelief as she pulled the girl away from the embrace by her shoulder. Grace looked deep into Jean's forlorn eyes and restated, \"You're worried that just because you aren't a brute who hurts other people, Guy will discard you from the Sect?\"\n\nJean produced an imperceptible nod to which Grace scoffed and asked, \"Do you think Guy would do that? Do you REALLY think he's that kind of a guy?\"\n\nJean hesitated, eliciting a stern reprimand from Grace, \"I'm disappointed that you still haven't comprehended what kind of a person your teacher is after studying under them for over a year.\"\n\n\"But Mister Larks HAS changed,\" Jean responded. She went on to explain how Guy's application cases and lessons had taken a more aggressive turn.\n\n\"It's about time he did that,\" Grace commented, much to Jean's surprise. \"He's learned that the world isn't so breezy as he'd thought it to be. Besides, Jean, people never change, they only grow. Take a look at this sapling here,\" Grace pointed at the subject a few metres away from the path.\n\n\"It's sprouted in that location, it can't do anything else but grow there. Though, as it grows taller and wider, it can deviate in its trajectory to seek out the most abundant source of nutrition and greatest access to sunlight. Yet, it can never uproot itself and find new ground to call its home. Humans are just like that. When you scrape off all the surrounding layers, dig deeper, you will find out that our core character never changes,\" Grace returned her gaze to Jean and playfully rubbed the girl's head. \"Guy's still the same. He's just grown.\"\n\nWith that, Grace picked up her steps and walked towards the orphanage. As she did so, she paused and threw out a final line of advice, \"Don't think for a second that you aren't of any use, Jean.\"\n\nGrace retrieved the dried soap bar from her satchel and waved it around, \"You have so much stuck inside your head that's just waiting to jump out.\"\n\nJean revealed a rare, faint smile as she observed Grace's confident figure skipping down the path to the orphanage. The words Matron Reva told her resonated inside her head, lulling the arguing voices to a silent halt. Her face formed a resolute expression as she trudged along. She continued without pause or hesitation until she arrived outside Mister Larks' bedroom door. She exhaled and knocked on his door mechanically.\n\n\"Jean? Come in,\" Guy welcomed from inside.\n\nRight as Jean entered, Guy reminded, \"Please leave the door open. Sit, sit!\"\n\n\"Now tell me, what's up?\"\n\nJean looked directly into Mister Larks' eyes and noticed the same gaze that welcomed her into his tutelage a year back. Maybe things did change around here - Teacher Larks became Mister Larks - but just like Matron Reva said, the man within hadn't changed. Now, without procrastinating any further, Jean opened her mouth and explained her concerns.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-195]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":23,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 193 - An Apt Name","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\"According to my Master, the name of a Sect matters a lot,\" Marie said offhandedly. \"Are you sure that you want us to do it?\"\n\n\"Ultimately, the Sect will service you folk,\" Guy shrugged. \"Who better to bestow it its name than those that will comprise it?\"\n\nGuy observed a complicated expression spawn across everyone's face. He could see that they were struggling with it. It was understandable. After all, he was putting them on the spot with this request. No one could turn on their creativity like a switch, on-demand unless they were Kano of course - that boy was a well of creativity that seemingly never ran dry. He could create seasons that didn't exist, sceneries that were beyond mythical, beasts that hadn't been envisioned before, and he could evoke emotions that couldn't be put into words. Guy was tempted to take Kano's input in this, but he figured that there were still a few more years left until the Sect became relevant to Kano. Who could predict if Kano would even be interested in joining the Sect at that time? This is considering that the Sect existed at that time. All in all, it wasn't fair to do so.\n\n\"Let's follow this strategy,\" Guy declared as he clapped his hands. \"We will spend ten minutes, brainstorming ideas. Each person will come up with one name, and why they chose it. They must present their honest opinions and profess their case. After that, the quorum will debate the name. Whether it is viable? Whether it needs to be changed? And so on. Sound reasonable?\"\n\nThe group hummed and proceeded with the activity. Right as they started, Marie noticed that Guy wasn't doing anything, \"Aren't you participating as well, Sect Leader?\"\n\n\"I came up with a few names earlier. I didn't like them,\" Guy confessed while shaking his head.\n\n\"We could still debate on it,\" Marie offered.\n\n\"That's not necessary. I won't go with it even if you guys decide it. Those that contribute, have the right to veto their own works,\" Guy retorted smugly.\n\nWith that, all three of Guy's students regressed into contemplation. Each of their approaches to this was different, and unique befitting their personalities.\n\nMarie was methodical. She promptly drew a table on a piece of paper and started to list out names off the top of her head followed by their pros and cons.\n\nJean was measured in her approach. It looked like she debated her ideas internally to a thorough level before her writing utensil pressed itself against the paper.\n\nMarkus, for better or worse, followed Guy's strategy of drawing a mind map and generating ideas based on key phrases and concepts. Although many sites and books promoted this method for brainstorming ideas, Guy admitted that it never really worked for him. All it did was complicate the matter further by amplifying the number of choices he had to filter between exponentially with each new branch. But this was all Guy's opinion, maybe it worked for others. Why else would organisation gurus push it so enthusiastically?\n\nGuy kept time mentally, and to his surprise, the trio finished their first set of ideas well ahead of the ten minutes he set earlier.\n\n\"Who's going first?\"\n\n\"Me,\" Marie volunteered. She walked up to the front of the class and prepared to speak when Guy quickly reminded her to jot down the name on the blackboard.\n\n\"The name I went for was 'Bright Horizons Sect'. I chose this name for two reasons. The first is to establish an optimistic impression of the Sect. People that join this Sect can expect appreciative growth in the future. Secondly, the name can also act as an auspicious marker, indicating that the Sect will experience great success.\"\n\n\"Good job, Marie,\" Guy commended. He was proud of Marie's enthusiasm and readiness to put herself out there.\n\n\"Now, the floor is open for your opinions. Please keep it civil and constructive,\" Guy said.\n\n\"I think it's a nice name,\" Jean opined. \"It presents a possible vision of the Sect, for both its members and itself.\"\n\n\"I also agree,\" Markus chimed in. \"But I also feel like the name is a bit open-ended and vague.\"\n\n\"Can you expand on that Markus?\" Guy volleyed.\n\n\"The name does not explore the present nature of the Sect. It professes what the Sect could be and achieve. But it does not portray what members can expect from the Sect in the present. I think we should try to include details along those lines as well,\" Markus expounded.\n\nMarie flashed her tongue as a cheeky challenge and returned to her seat.\n\n\"I-I will go next,\" Jean said while raising her hand.\n\n\"Along the veins of Senior Brother's reasoning, the name I came up with is 'Renewal Sect'. It alludes to how Sect Leader intends to redefine the function and purpose of a Sect while offering members a second chance and new opportunities. It also resonated with me since I was able to renew my quest towards becoming a healer and my passion for the subject.\"\n\n\"Good! Something personal, I like it,\" Guy commended. \"What about you guys?\"\n\n\"It's good,\" Marie nodded.\n\n\"Same here,\" Markus affirmed.\n\n\"That's it?\" Guy snorted. \"Okay...\" he shrugged seeing as no one was willing to provide additional criticisms. He figured that the two were being considerate of Jean, who struggled with public speaking in general due to her inability to gauge the audience. He was satisfied that they thought that way, but he didn't miss the slight disappointment flashing across Jean's face as she returned to her seat.\n\n'She was hoping to receive an opportunity to stand her ground,' Guy confirmed mentally.\n\n\"Although I like the name, Jean,\" Guy said. \"I feel that it lacks sufficient punch. It doesn't have the force needed to stand out amongst other, more prominent sects. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\nJean's eyes opened up with satisfaction and she nodded thoughtfully. \"Now that it's been pointed out, I can see the shortcoming. Thank you Sect Leader.\"\n\n\"By the way, I noticed that everyone's calling me Sect Leader now?\" Guy segued. \"We haven't even officially established the Sect yet, isn't it a bit premature?\"\n\n\"We all know it's an eventuality,\" Marie chuckled. \"We're just getting used to it.\"\n\n\"It's too long!\" Guy said while shaking his head. \"I don't think you can call me Teacher without getting sued by the Co-operative. So, just call me Mister Larks or just Guy. \"\n\n\"Okay, Guy it is,\" Marie affirmed with a muffled laugh.\n\n\"Marie!\" Markus yelped. \"Master,\" he then pleaded with a worried gaze.\n\n\"You can call me whatever you want, Markus. Respect doesn't adhere to a name, but the person,\" Guy said while waving his hands. He turned to Jean and gazed at her expectantly.\n\n\"I will call you Mister Larks...\" the girl mumbled.\n\n\"Since that's out of the way, let's get back to the business at hand. Markus, it's your turn now,\" Guy redirected.\n\n\"My current frontrunner for sect names is the 'Shifting Paradigms Sect',\" Markus started. \"It's inspired by how we are constantly encouraged and forced to question our beliefs and biases and broaden our understanding of the trivialities that prevail around us. Even the simplest of phenomena have innumerable mechanisms underlying them that at first glance are impossible to fathom. Yet as you unfurl it, layer by layer, things start to make sense.\"\n\n\"That's a wonderful rationale, Markus,\" Guy congratulated.\n\n\"I agree,\" Marie followed up. \"But I think it's too complicated and wordy. Paradigm is a tough word that I don't think many people will know the meaning of. And it's a mouthful.\"\n\n\"That is a fair point,\" Guy agreed. \"No matter, we still have time. Let's resume the process. Marie, now it's your turn.\"\n\nThey then continued the brainstorming session. Incrementally, the blackboard was populated with a plethora of names offered by his three students. However, the discussion stopped maintaining its civility near the end, as exhaustion and irritability started to take hold of their minds. After all, it was never pleasant having your ideas denied.\n\nBy the end, a still silence reigned in the class. No one took the initiative to go up to the board and jot down another name. Either they were out of ideas, or just didn't have the motivation to do so.\n\nGuy looked around and sighed upon seeing the morose faces.\n\n'I guess I'll have to go with one of my own,' he concluded begrudgingly. As he was about to erase the names from the board, Jean shot up from her seat.\n\nHer eyes flashed with a rare sparkle, and she gulped excitedly.\n\n\"I... I have another one!\" She exclaimed uncharacteristically.\n\nShe walked up to the front and started explaining.\n\n\"I got inspired by Senior Brother's very first idea,\" she said while pointing at the crossed-out 'Shifting Paradigms Sect' on the blackboard. \"Senior Brother defined it as the result of peeling away the layers of obfuscations to get to the truth. To put it another way, here we learn how to look beyond the falsehoods presented to us and get to the fundamental truths. A world without mana, that is the truth.\"\n\nWith an extremely agitated expression, she declared, \"'True World Sect'! That is the name. It defines what we seek to do here. It encapsulates the vision, and the mission succinctly. And, it is short and catchy, like Mister Larks pointed out.\"\n\nThe still silence that impregnated the room morphed into one filled with excitement. While the students contemplated this idea, something moved within Guy's soul.\n\nAll of a sudden, he started to feel animated as the name echoed within his mind. A part of him was resonating with it. The minute tear within the RoK widened slightly, and an ominous aura rippled out before dissipating.\n\n\"I like it!\" Guy asserted. \"Opinions?\"\n\n\"It's perfect,\" Marie agreed, and so did Markus.\n\n\"So that does it then. From here on out, our Sect with be known as the True World Sect.\"\n\nWith a booming voice, Guy added with fervour, \"Our vision is to educate the uninformed masses of the truth that our world is built upon. And our mission is to cultivate free thinkers that can challenge the established facts that lack proper scientific founding and pursue the truth no matter the co-\"\n\nGuy coughed as he finally caught himself. He shook his head to clear his rampant and somewhat anarchic thoughts and alternated his gaze between his students who sported a confused expression.\n\n\"I, uh...\" he muttered. \"I'm feeling a bit woozy. I stayed up all night brainstorming. I ought to rest,\" he said with a strained smile.\n\n\"Anyways, class dismissed.\"\n\n'That was weird. I lost myself there for a second. I... I think I need to clear my head a little bit.'\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-194]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":24,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 192 - Crowdsourcing","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\"Senior Brother,\" Jean called out as she walked alongside Markus to their upcoming lesson on magic theory and application with their Teacher Larks. Or should she refer to him as Sect Leader Larks now? Jean had heard of the plan to create a new Sect. She seriously considered it, and also evaluated Sect Leader Larks' intentions behind moving for such an initiative, and she was all for it. As she saw her cultivation advancing and saw the positive impact she had on her community with the help of her magic, her mother's research, plus the new knowledge she accumulated from Sect Leader Larks' lessons and |Soul Imprint| sessions, she very much wanted to recruit more potential mages who could walk with her in her path and help the world become a better place.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Markus responded as he slowed his pace to match Jean's.\n\n\"I've noticed that the lessons on magic theory and application have gotten a little bit more aggressive as of late,\" she commented.\n\n\"How so?\" Markus probed with a slight frown.\n\n\"Well... In the last lesson, we talked a bit more about inducing magnetic fields,\" Jean started. \"About how passing an electric current through coils of wires can create an artificial magnetic field. Usually, Teacher follows it up with an example of where it can be applied. Before, it would be practical uses in terms of utility. Maybe like using it to separate iron dust from an impure mixture or something like that.\"\n\nMarkus agreed with a hum.\n\n\"Instead, he talked about how it could be used to create an extremely lethal projectile launcher that can propel objects are Mach speeds.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Markus responded. At that instant, Jean stopped moving forward and remained in place.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Markus asked.\n\n\"That's it?\" Jean said with a hint of disbelief in her monotone voice. \"Just 'You're right?'\"\n\n\"What's up?\" Before could continue his inquiry, Marie popped in and slung her hand over Jean's shoulders. \"Why're we waiting here? Is the lesson cancelled? That's weird, I didn't see that in my divination...\"\n\n\"It isn't cancelled,\" Markus corrected. \"Jean had something to talk about, so we just took a pause. That's all.\"\n\n\"What's it about?\" Marie probed excitedly. \"Wait a minute. Is it about you two...\" She entangled her two index fingers and wobbled her eyebrows provocatively.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Markus responded with a scrunched-up face filled with confusion. Jean would have done the same, except her emotion-evoking centre was rusty and her facial muscles wouldn't listen to her.\n\nMarie clicked her tongue, \"You guys are no fun. You'll understand what I mean when you grow up.\"\n\n\"You're a year older than I am,\" Markus shot back. \"What difference does a year make?\"\n\n\"A lot!\" Marie scoffed. \"Anyways, stop deviating from the topic. What were you guys talking about?\"\n\n\"Jean pointed out that the recent application cases of concepts covered in the lesson have become a bit more aggressive,\" Markus reiterated.\n\n\"Oh, this is about the Gauss Rifle!\" Marie expertly pointed out. \"So what's the issue?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Jean stretched. She didn't know how to phrase her response. Something was gnawing away at her. Recently, the malicious voice in her head had gotten much louder and more enthusiastic with the flashy and destructive displays from the lesson. It was becoming harder for her to concentrate.\n\n\"I can understand why Teacher is doing this,\" Marie continued, attracting Jean's attention.\n\n\"He intends to start a Sect. A Sect is basically a mercenary corp with a more palatable packaging. I've travelled in many merchant caravans and assisted through many trade ventures. The organisations prefer to hire Sects to escort them because there is some guarantee of safety and martial support from their members. This also happens to be the way sects make most of their money. If we intend to be part of Teacher Larks' Sect - I guess it's Sect Leader Larks now - then we need to have some degree of preparedness and capacity to defend ourselves when we take such jobs,\" Marie explained.\n\n\"Besides, Markus here got himself into trouble just by being present in a location. He was lucky that he had some experience in defending himself with magic. What about you?\" Marie asked Jean. \"Do you think you would survive in such situations? What if your protector, Josie, isn't there to have your back?\"\n\n\"I... I don't want to hurt anybody,\" Jean muttered.\n\n#Your weakness will be your undoing! Then again, it would be better if you just died.#\n\n\"Well, Sect Leader is just preparing everyone for the Sect, I guess,\" Marie reasoned. \"But if you aren't comfortable being a member of the Sect, Jean, you don't have to force yourself. I kind of have to, even if I am not averse to joining the Sect since my Master chose to align himself with it. Markus here is kind of obligated to do so for the same reason. You don't necessarily have to do that. Your obligation is first with your Clan.\"\n\n\"Father said I can join the Sect if I want to,\" Jean muttered. \"And... I want to. But, I also don't want my magic to maim others. My mother always told me that a healer must use their magic for the good of everyone.\"\n\n\"Everyone has their reason to learn magic,\" Markus hummed contemplatively. \"You don't have to do what you aren't comfortable doing. If you want, I can talk to Master about it.\"\n\n\"That would be too much,\" Jean spoke up immediately, waving her hands.\n\n\"He's right,\" Marie supported. \"If you are uncomfortable, make it known. It's as Sect Leader Larks always says, 'Learning for the sake of learning will net you the opposite effect.'\"\n\nJean nodded thoughtfully and followed the duo to the classroom.\n\n\"You guys are late,\" Guy commented as they entered.\n\n\"We stopped to talk. Jean has something she would like to say,\" Marie answered. Guy gazed expectantly at the usually quiet girl and awaited her statement.\n\n\"I-I will talk to Sect Leader after the lesson,\" Jean quickly said with a discomfited expression.\n\n\"Okay,\" Guy shrugged. \"Unfortunately, we won't be learning anything today. I actually have another task from you guys that needs work.\"\n\n\"As you all know, I am planning to start a sect. Matron Reva has given her permission to use this location as our base, which solves the primary logistical nightmare. However, we cannot proceed with registering it without...\" Guy started to tap his podium to replicate a drumroll, \"... a name!\"\n\n\"So in today's lesson, I want everyone to brainstorm names for the Sect,\" Guy concluded.\n\n\"You don't have a name already, Master?\" Markus asked in disbelief.\n\nIn truth, Guy did have names, but given his modern sensibilities, they reeked of cringe and eighth-grader syndrome. He wanted to choose something that matched the standards of this world, but everything he came up with caused his toes to curl and shoulders to shudder when he said it out loud. He couldn't even write them on paper without giggling.\n\nOn top of that, most of the names he came up with that could hold water were derived from sect names he'd heard in his past life in novels. Although they were great, their significance stemmed from where the sects were located. Furthermore, in truth, Guy did not feel like plagiarising from others' works; even in this life, he would affiliate scientific theories and discoveries with the original scientists even if they did not exist in this world. It just didn't sit right with him to appropriate others' contributions, since Guy was an educator at heart. \n\nTo that end, referring to some classic wuxia novels written by Jin Yong, the Wudang Sect was called such due to it being situated in the Wudang Mountains. The same went for the Huasan Sect, which literally translated to Mount Hua. The Beggers' Sect was comprised of beggars, hence the creative name. Guy would have simply followed these conventions and named his sect Mount Tai Sect after the mountain the orphanage was built upon, but it also fell under the cringe-worthy category, AND it was also a sword-centric sect from Jin Yong's works.\n\nSo, Guy decided to let his students come up with something. At least if it fell from their mouths, he wouldn't shudder so frantically, and they would also provide a fresher perspective to his writer's block.\n\n\"I'm really bad with names,\" Guy confessed. \"Based on research, the name of a Sect has a lot to do with the kind of cultivation techniques that comprise its core, and to an extent the speciality of the Sect. For instance, the Cloudstrider Sect specialise in movement-centric cultivation techniques and ritual formations. The cultivation techniques are heavily influenced by how mist behaves, and the ritual formations are geared towards illusions and deception.\"\n\n\"The Sunken Fist Sect specialise in, surprise-surprise, fist-based martial arts and close combat. They also have a strong stake in many blacksmithing ventures. The Sunspot Sect, which ended up going extinct thanks to Marie's Master specialised in area-of-effect and ranged spells. According to a record, the Sect Master could incinerate an entire City to ashes within seconds with just a single spell. Now, I don't know how accurate that record was, most of it was embellished with flowery words and speculations, but it's enough to highlight the main points.\"\n\nGuy gazed probingly at his students and said, \"I know it is early and a bit unprepared, but we need to decide on a name for our Sect. We can use the parameters I discussed before as guidelines, or we can come up with something different.\"\n\nThen, as if it were choreographed, the students in the room brought one of their hands up to their chins and scratched in contemplation. It was comically synchronised which elicited a chuckle from Guy. Luckily, they were too deep in thought to register it.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-193]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":25,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 191 - Losing Oneself","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"*sigh* What happened now?\" Grace droned as she watched Al and Markus dragging an unconscious Guy in by his shoulders, with Jean fanning the man's face with a spell.\n\n\"Master exhausted his mana,\" Markus explained with a bitter smile.\n\n\"I can see who you all learn it from - Marie and yourself, that is,\" Grace derided Markus sarcastically. \"Leave him to me, I'll take him to his room.\"\n\n\"Master is quite heavy...\" Markus muttered.\n\n\"I've carried heavier,\" Grace scoffed and strung Guy over her shoulders like a sack of rice and walked towards his room.\n\nAl's eyes followed the stout woman carrying a man at most twice her size as though it were nothing, but his mind was preoccupied with something else. In a half-trance, he traced his steps back to his tent and slumped into a cross-legged lotus position.\n\n\"What happened back there?\" He muttered to himself. When Guy used that attack on him, Al lost control of his body. Something from inside urged him to obey Guy's command as though it was the right thing to do. It was extremely unsettling and irksome. To feel helpless and weak was never a pleasant experience.\n\nAs Al pondered over the earlier events, a series of audible knocks interrupted his contemplation. Al frowned and extended his senses outwards, only to choke on his saliva upon realising who the guest was.\n\n\"*cough* Please come in!\" Al exclaimed in a high-pitched voice.\n\nThe door at the tent's entrance swung open slowly and an elderly man limped in, with a walking stick leading the charge.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" Krish commented as he sat down near Al's initial seat. \"Stop standing like a stooge. Sit!\"\n\nAl nodded vigorously and sat down on his knees in front of Krish.\n\n\"Friend,\" Krish sighed in defeat. \"Can you please act comfortably? You're making it harder for me to hold a conversation.\"\n\nAl nodded again and sat down in a tense cross-legged pose.\n\n\"H-How can I help, Mage Nara?\" Al inquired cautiously.\n\n\"I'm here to talk about Guy's ability,\" Krish emphasised. \"I saw what happened earlier. It was surprising. How did it go for you?\"\n\nAl frowned while recollecting the feeling of being played like a puppet, \"I don't know how to describe it. I've never experienced anything like it before. My mind kept telling me that the only words I could say are 'meow' or 'hiss' or a 'purr' which I could not produce with my vocal cords. And for a few seconds, I believed it. I don't quite understand why though?\"\n\nKrish shook his head and tapped at Al's chest with his index finger, \"It's because you're weak here!\"\n\n\"My heart?\"\n\n\"Your soul,\" Krish corrected. \"I count two times prior, this being your third, suffering under an attack directed at your soul. Yet, even with all of your intelligence, you are unable to deduce the cause of your weakness? I thought you were supposed to be perceptive.\"\n\n\"My soul?\" Al repeated in shock. \"Are you implying that Guy's ability attack the soul? If so, then it's beyond powerful. It's unstoppable! No one in his realm bothers to cultivate their spirituality. It does make sense though - most of the benefits he derived from his inheritance revolve around the soul.\"\n\n\"Seriously, you need to get started on it right about now. Haven't you suffered enough?\" Krish pointed out.\n\nAl revealed a bitter smile and confessed, \"It's difficult for me. I have many demons lurking within my heart that are waiting to swallow me whole.\"\n\n\"Is it to do with your Student?\" Krish shot back and received a sorrowful nod from Al.\n\n\"Your destinies are tied together,\" Krish said while shaking his head thoughtfully. \"It is unfortunate that I cannot untangle that web without incurring a massive debt with the universe. You see, while he is a monster birthed by your negligence, you won't be the one to slay him.\"\n\n\"You're saying that the boy will face retribution, correct?!\" Al uttered in agitation.\n\n\"Depends on what you define retribution to be,\" Krish rebutted. \"You must realise that he has nothing left to lose. Everything he held dear was taken from him. One after another, this world took and took, until what remained was a dry husk of a man in a state of arrested development. His heart had turned cold, and what he needed was someone to give him warmth. That was something you failed to do.\"\n\n\"I pushed him too hard,\" Al agreed. \"I was selfish and indulgent. I knew there was a darkness lurking in his eyes. He had a grudge with the world, and in my fervour to cultivate a prodigy, I failed to soothe it.\"\n\n\"Although I cannot tell you if you will overcome that hurdle and break free of the shackles holding you in your current realm. I urge you to practice cultivating your spirituality. You will face more dangers of this nature in the future, and it would be a shame if you suffer a fatal injury due to your carelessness,\" Krish cautioned.\n\n\"May I ask why Mage Nara is so thoughtful of me all of a sudden?\" Al responded with vigilance.\n\n\"If Guy ever has any problems, he will approach you first,\" Krish answered. \"He is more open with you and treats you with respect due to your vast knowledge. He cannot approach me even though I have more experience because there are situations where my lips are bound by fate. Oftentimes, I know the answer the lad is seeking but I cannot divulge it lest it affects the preset sequence of events.\"\n\n\"I am a little intrigued, though. Do you think Guy's Sect will proliferate?\" Al asked.\n\n\"As I said, the Sect will push this world to heights you have never seen before!\" Krish responded enthusiastically.\n\n\"But I still don't see Guy acting the way you predicted. Would he really be able to do all those... unpleasant things?\" Al questioned, voicing his uncertainty.\n\n\"If you're asking me if he's capable,\" Krish said with a dubious tone. \"I'd like you to remember what it felt like to completely lose control of your body. To be forced to accept a reality that contradicted your personal beliefs. Now, amplify that to encompass a large crowd - maybe even the population of an entire city?\"\n\nThe more Krish talked, the more drenched Al's back became. If Guy made a wrong turn and his personality changed for the worse, he could wreak havoc beyond comprehension. Not even Ziva could compare to the potential carnage Guy could leave in his wake, if his hands were forced. He could, quite literally, convince people to fight each other by just saying a few words.\n\n\"At this point, you will try to convince yourself that Guy isn't that kind of person. Your interaction with him till now would support that claim. However, a seed has been planted in his heart. A very powerful and destructive seed of revenge. Anger and hatred have sprouted in his tranquil soul and it will barrel out of control,\" Krish added.\n\n\"Revenge? Against whom?\"\n\n\"Someone you know,\" Krish answered with an ominous smirk. \"There is no benefit in knowing their identity. Not now anyways - it will be revealed in due time. Suffice to say that they will die a very painful death in Guy's hands.\"\n\n\"I... don't believe it,\" Al muttered.\n\n\"You must have heard of erumpents?\"\n\n\"Do you mean the single-horned, herbivorous beast endemic to the Boreas Plains?\" Al clarified.\n\n\"That's right. Did you know that they are known to be one of the calmest and friendliest creatures in the world?\"\n\n\"I do remember hearing that.\"\n\n\"There is nothing beneficial gained from killing erumpents. Their meat is inedible due to its high acidity and toughness. On the other hand, there is everything to gain from having them alive. Their hair can be used to make clothes. They shed their horns at the end of every mating season which can be used to make weapons. Their milk is nutritious and lasts for many months before spoiling. Heck, even the bull erumpent's semen has use as a... performance enhancer.\"\n\n\"I do know this,\" Al affirmed.\n\n\"Then you must know that humans don't attack these beasts, not because there is no benefit from doing so, but because of what these erumpents do when they face uncalled aggression? Erumpents are known to gore their aggressors with their horns and eviscerate them alive. An erumpent is naturally learned in healing magic. They will constantly heal their victims as they work on them. And once the victim can no longer hold on and dies, they impale their bodies through the anus and carry the carcass on their horns until the body starts to decay, at which point they dispose of it. All of this just to send a message to future aggressors of what fate they will suffer if they attempt doing something so idiotic.\"\n\n\"Why are you telling me all this?\"\n\nKrish stared meaningfully at Al until the message clicked in his mind. Al's mouth widened in shock.\n\n\"You don't mean-\"\n\n\"Erumpents are herbivorous. They don't revel in uncalled murder. But they will do it if they have to all the while being mindful of their limits - they know how to not lose themselves to anger. But humans aren't born with such inhibitors,\" Krish highlighted.\n\n\"That is to say, erumpents behave this way for a reason. However, they know when to stop. Humans, when walking down such a destructive path, can often lack the self-control to stop. Guy exudes an aura of a centred and mature person, however, there will come a time when he will lose all reason. At that moment, just like an erumpent, he will have the potential to unleash hell at an unprecedented scale,\" Krish added. \"When Guy reaches the precipice - the edge of the cliff beyond which he will lose all sense of right and wrong - someone must stop him. And that someone will be you. Guy's future is in flux and I'm finding it difficult to narrow the exact sequence. Therefore, I need someone to keep an eye on him. I can only do so with limited capacity. Which leaves only you.\"\n\n\"What do you need me to do?\"\n\n\"You have experience with one mage gone astray. Catch Guy before he trudges the same path. To that end, I must once again remind you to practice cultivating your spirituality. If you even have to go toe-to-toe with Guy, I fear you will fail miserably,\" Krish advised. Once he was finished, he stood up and said, \"That is all I have to say for today. Don't ask me any more questions, I cannot answer them,\" and left.\n\nAl hummed by himself while contemplating Krish's warning. The conversation was disconcerting and brought up a long of unpleasant points that, unfortunately, were of great concern.\n\n\"Nonetheless, Mage Nara is right. I cannot let another mage with promise lose themselves to their inner demons. Although I cannot stop Guy from seeking whatever revenge he is after, I can do everything within my power to stop him from sacrificing his humanity in its pursuit. That is something I must do at all costs!\" He promised to himself with a firm expression.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-192]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":26,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 190 - I Reject Your Reality and Substitute My Own","n":0.302},"1":{"v":"\n\"So, what did you find through your meditation?\" Al inquired. He and Guy were standing facing each other in the impromptu sparring area.\n\n\"I'm going to do it now. But I will need you to do a few things for me to test some stuff out,\" Guy answered as he extended his arms to his side, with open palms facing towards the sky. He closed his eyes and started to call out the mana from his core and directed it out his palms.\n\nA translucent mist started to emanate from Guy's hands, like a humidifier. Interestingly, instead of diffusing into the atmosphere, it hung in place and spread outwards. Within minutes, a heavy mist enveloped the sparring field, fully encompassing Guy's entire mana domain.\n\n\"What does it feel like to you?\" Guy inquired.\n\n\"It's definitely not water or any kind of gas for that matter,\" Al answered. He extended his tongue outwards and licked the air. He then sniffed multiple times and narrowed his eyes. \"Has no taste or smell.\"\n\n\"It's mana,\" Al responded after observing the area with his mana sense. Suddenly, his eyes widened in shock. \"The mana is tethered to the atmospheric mana. This is interesting it isn't displacing it at all!\"\n\n\"Teacher Jeeves,\" Markus called out from the side. \"What does that signify?\" Jean perked up as well, directing her full attention to Uncle Jeeves' explanation.\n\n\"Generally, when a mage exudes mana from their core into the atmosphere it displaces the existing mana. This is also one of the ways to take full control of your mana domain, although it is extremely inefficient. Usually, mages prefer to recruit the atmospheric mana with spells, just like how Cleo did during your fight.\"\n\n\"That being said, although your Master is releasing the mana from his core into the environment, it is not actually displacing the existing mana. Instead, his mana seems to unify itself with the atmospheric mana. This means that you and I can still use the atmospheric mana perfectly.\" Al waved his hand causing a small tornado to form in his palms.\n\n\"Not that it was an issue in the first place. With our cultivation realm gap, retaking control of the domain is trivial,\" he added as he dispersed the tornado.\n\n\"Although, this isn't the first time I've seen this method of mana dispersion. It is commonly used by assassins to gain control of their environment without letting their targets know of their presence,\" Al informed.\n\n\"Alright then, what's next?\" Al asked Guy with anticipation oozing in his voice.\n\n\"Prepare yourself,\" Guy warned as he closed his eyes. Al braced himself for what was to come. After living and learning with this Master and Disciple, he realised the importance of vigilance.\n\nThe mist surrounding Al started to flicker and ambiguous images began appearing in their place.\n\nGuy frowned and said, \"It's harder than it looks. I'll need more practice to perfect this one...\"\n\n\"Take it slowly,\" Al assuaged.\n\nGuy hummed and continued. Intermittently, he portrayed a stressed frown which in turn caused the flickering to hasten. Finally, after ten minutes, the scene stabilised.\n\n\"Woah!\" Al exclaimed as he looked around. His surroundings had warped completely. What was originally an open, outdoor space had now turned into a cavernous room lit by flickering candles and lamps.\n\n\"Is this the Cloudstrider Sect's Archive?\" Al inquired as he approached the rows of bookshelves present before him. As his hands slid over the wooden shelves, his eyes widened in shock.\n\n\"This is uncannily realistic,\" Al commented. \"The texture,\" he sniffed, \"the smell,\" he curled his hand into a fist and knocked on the wooden surface eliciting an echoing clack, \"even the sound!\"\n\nHe moved forward a picked out a book from the shelf. He flipped it open and rubbed the paper as well as the bindings. He performed the initial sensory assessments and after he was impressed once again, he proceeded to read the contents.\n\n\"These don't seem like gibberish. This is all correct isn't it?\" Al asked while turning towards Guy. As he did so, he observed that Guy had assumed a seated lotus position and was in a calm, near-meditative state.\n\n\"I can't afford to let my concentration waver-\" right as Guy said that the surroundings started to flicker. But Guy immediately grasped his fleeting focus and secured the illusion.\n\nAl hummed affirmatively and recruited Markus and Jean to help inspect the illusion. The trio started to flip through the books and poke and prod the room and all of its contents. After a full thirty minutes of exhaustive investigation, Al concluded, \"This is beyond anything I have ever seen before. This looks so real that I could've honestly confused it as such if you hadn't expressly indicated that it was an ability.\"\n\nHe turned to Markus and asked, \"What do your senses tell you?\"\n\nMarkus activated his spacetime vision and inspected his surroundings. \"Nothing unusual. They also indicate that this is all real. Everything has mass and a presence.\"\n\n\"But they technically don't right?\" Al highlighted with some uncertainty. \"These should all be an illusion. If Guy lets go of his concentration, they will all disappear. But everything about the situation here tells me otherwise...\"\n\nAt that instant, the scene started to waver again and finally dissipated.\n\n\"It's like when someone lies so convincingly that it becomes the truth?\" Guy called out with a bitter smile. \"My ability is an extension of my |Soul Imprint| but in the real world. I can manipulate everything within my mana domain to fit a reality I deem to be the truth.\"\n\nAl's jaw dropped so hard that, if not for the joint attaching it to his skull, it could very easily drill into the ground and embed itself there permanently.\n\n\"That is insane!\" Al exclaimed as the concept finally settled in his mind. \"Mind you, I tried everything in my repertoire to tamper with that illusion, but I couldn't affect it at all! For all intents and purposes, my repository of spells and skills tailored to interacting with illusory magic all told me that there was nothing of that sort in effect. This means that the only way to truly dispel this ability is to jolt you, the caster.\"\n\n\"It's balanced in that way,\" Guy shrugged. \"I have to actively manifest what I'm trying to show you in my mind, including every detail. If it is from a memory, the effect is generally much stronger hence why I chose the Archives as a trial. I don't think it would be so easy to recollect something from further back.\"\n\nGuy closed his eyes and concentrated once again. The surroundings jittered and shook before another scenery was formed.\n\n\"This is my office,\" Al indicated. \"No, I can see what you meant. There are minor lapses here and there that easily give it away. Well, this primarily has to do with the fact that I am deeply intimated with this room and I have personally embedded a few formations here and there that are absent in this recreation.\"\n\nAl reached for one of his draws and pulled it open, revealing an empty space, \"Since you don't know what goes in here, it is empty. I can see the limitations now.\"\n\nJust to confirm, Al inspected other, familiar, regions of his room and noted the differences as they became known. \"Actually, this is convincing enough to fool most people at lower realms. I don't think Markus or Jean would have been able to differentiate, right?\"\n\nJean nodded in response as Markus chimed in. \"I have only been in Teacher Jeeves' rooms a limited number of times. And during those attendances, I wasn't paying much attention to key details. Right now, I could easily be convinced that I am back at the Academy.\"\n\nGuy dispersed the illusion. As he did so, everyone noticed the sudden lightness of the mist compared to before.\n\n\"So you consume the mana distributed in your domain the more you use it to portray illusions?\" Al surmised.\n\n\"There are other factors as well. For instance, the more sensory data I try to mould in, the more mana it consumes. Duration of holding the illusion as well as the scale of the illusion also influences the amount of mana used,\" Guy added.\n\n\"All in all, it's a pretty good ability. Though I worry that the breadth may be limited with this one,\" Al hinted while tilting his head.\n\n\"Actually...\" Guy interjected as he elongated the syllable. \"There is an additional aspect to this ability.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Guy hummed as he searched for the right words. \"You can think of my ability as being able to manipulate reality, correct?\"\n\nAfter receiving acknowledging nods from his audience, he said, \"Till now, I've only shown how to manipulate the non-sentient entities in the environment. My ability also encompasses sentient beings.\"\n\n\"Can you expound on that?\"\n\n\"Again, it's easier to demonstrate. I will use my ability on you, Teacher Jeeves,\" Guy warned.\n\nGuy exhaled loudly and closed his eyes. After a short minute, he pointed at Al's face and said, \"You are clean-shaven.\"\n\nWhile Guy's lips mouthed those words, no sound left them. Instead, a hoarse and throaty voice reverberated all around Al and assaulted his senses. Al could feel his mind vibrating as those words made their way through his ear canals and hammered into his brain with unrelenting force.\n\nAl furrowed his brows and felt his face, and was surprised to find it devoid of any hair at all. Before Al could say anything, the clean region wobbled and his previous batch of hair returned to its rightful place.\n\n\"It's harder to do with sentient beings I guess. The moment your mind opposed the change, it became harder for me to enforce my will,\" Guy said with a wry smile. \"Reality depends on how it is perceived. For sentient beings, they are aware of their self so it is much harder to manipulate that.\"\n\n\"I'm going to try something more forceful,\" Guy warned again. \"This will be my final test. I don't think I have enough mana to go further.\"\n\nGuy exhaled again and spoke, \"You are a cat.\"\n\nAgain, a hoarse and throaty voice resonated around Al. It spoke the words leaving Guy's lips and pervaded all of Al's senses. For a second, Al started to lose control of his body. Concerned, Al moved his lips and tried to vocalise his thoughts, yet to his horror, the sounds that left his mouth weren't what he intended\n\n\"Meow meow meeeeooooow *hiss* me-\" Al coughed as his senses came back to him, stopping any more cat-like noises from leaving his mouth.\n\n\"What the heck was that?!\" Al screamed incredulously. He looked towards Guy and noticed the man turning woozy and falling to the ground.\n\nAl rushed to catch the man, all the while suppressing the sweat dripping down his drenched back.\n\n'What in the world just happened?'\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-191]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":27,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 189 - Special Abilities and Powers","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nMagic is the art of warping reality - that was an established fact. The world flows in a particular way, this way is defined by the natural laws that ensure the world's stability. A mage, or any wielder of magic, and mana can tamper with this flow and manipulate it, to a limited degree. A mage can spawn fire in their palms, make water levitate, cause the earth to ripple, steady wind to grow turbulent, generate lightning from their fingers, accelerate plant growth, heal injuries, and many more. However, an abstract line is drawn in place that inhibits them from warping the natural laws beyond a certain point.\n\nThis 'line' denotes the barrier beyond which the stability of the world itself is threatened. For instance, A mage can spawn fire in their palms by either infusing a 'Fire' nature to their mana or by combusting fuel in their environment. Mages can even use magic to manipulate existing fires, redirecting them, compressing them, and even in some niche cases eating them for sustenance. However, although these feats appear extraordinary, they stand on the plausible end of the 'line'. What if a mage wants to turn their entire body into fire? No, not self-immolation, but actually turning into a figure made of flame with all the properties of fire without losing their lives? This breaks an uncountable number of natural laws - transmuting organic matter into plasma without expending energy or mass to activate and sustain this conversion, all the while ensuring that the 'sentience' of the being undergoing the transmutation isn't lost so that they can once again reverse the conversion and assume human form.\n\nYet, even if this sounds impossible and downright ridiculous, it is still within the realms of a mage's power as long as a condition, or from another perspective, a sacrifice is met on the mage's part. This condition is derived from the cultivation method that the mage practices. The cultivation method, in essence, moulds the mage's mind to fathom these implausible scenarios and goes on to imprint this information into their will. This imprinting is permanent and rigid. If a mage has imprinted a specific 'line crossing power' into their will, it is often difficult to accommodate another one. The barrier that separates the Mana Condensation mage from the Foundation Establishment realm is somewhat connected to these 'line crossing powers', for a lack of a better word.\n\nFrom a different standpoint, this is considered a sacrifice, since if the imprinted power lacks breadth and depth, it can often become difficult for a mage to advance past a specific cultivation realm since there are no longer any insights they can derive from it. The imprint becomes a shackle at this point. Taking the example of the flaming man, the power is extremely specific and the mage will find it hard to extract new inspiration to push forward in their cultivation unless they have some sort of breakthrough revelation that can maybe test their understanding of the power along a different trajectory without having to rehash their existing cultivation.\n\nMarkus' ability to observe and, to a small degree, manipulate spacetime is an example of this 'line crossing power'. The understanding of fate and its machinations is another type of power held by Marie and Krish Nara. While Guy didn't know much about the latter, he had enough assurance that there would be sufficient breadth and depth for Marie to work with since her Master had reached the Tesseract Transformation realm, which is the de facto pinnacle of magehood. As for the former, Guy was confident that there would be sufficient breadth and depth for Markus since he had only barely scratched the surface of that complicated topic.\n\n\"This is Markus' unique power,\" Al explained. He summarised the idea succinctly for Guy and his Disciple. \"My special power tends to contradict my earlier explanation, in that it allows me to borrow the powers of others. In a sense, I am not shackled by my cultivation method.\"\n\n\"That sounds a bit overpowered,\" Guy responded with a scowl.\n\n\"The world is fair,\" Al said while shaking his head. \"I must have a thorough understanding of the power exhibited by the mage to be able to replicate it. And even if I do satisfy that condition, replicating such powers drains me a lot. Additionally, I can only exhibit one special ability at a time - it's like I have to morph my own cultivation to attain the same flavour of the mage I am trying to replicate. And finally, I cannot benefit by obtaining new insights about that power - I can replicate but not innovate.\"\n\n\"I guess that IS fair,\" Guy muttered.\n\n\"In the same sense, you must also have a special ability,\" Al reiterated. \"Why don't you try exercising it?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure how... Do you think it might have something to do with how I can provide more potent |Soul Imprints| to my students?\" Guy surmised.\n\n\"That's possible, but I feel like that is more in line with cultivating the soul. You should have an ability more aligned with the cultivation of your will, right?\"\n\nGuy hummed in understanding and then tilted his head, \"Do you have any suggestions on how I can manifest it?\"\n\n\"This is more to do with yourself,\" Al denied immediately. \"Everyone has a different way, but a technique to get started is by meditating. You must inspect your cultivation core and determine it by yourself.\"\n\n\"That sounds incredibly haphazard,\" Guy commented.\n\n\"Well, your Disciple accomplished it, I don't see a reason why you can't,\" Al said with a mirthful chuckle. \"Nonetheless, I have nothing else to do at the moment. I will take over from here and spar with Markus and Jean. Might as well use this opportunity to understand his cultivation. In the meanwhile, you should meditate.\"\n\nGuy nodded affirmatively and receded to a space away from the sparring field and proceeded to cycle through the Yoga forms to initiate his meditation.\n\n____\n\nIt had been some time since Guy entered his core space. His previous attempt was not so pleasant, as he ended up getting trapped in some kind of an illusion. This time, Guy was prepared.\n\nThe mist that induced the illusion still hung around him, but his mind was vigilant and refused to submit to its attempts to pull him into a false reality. His senses flickered between images of alternate scenarios from his past life and the default empty state of his core space.\n\nThis went on for what felt like five minutes before the mist finally dissipated and started to retreat to the clear pool of stagnant water at the centre of the space. Guy noticed that the water body had grown significantly larger. If it was a pond before, it was now closer to a lake. It wasn't so vast that Guy couldn't see its boundaries, but it sure was difficult given the heavy layer of mist still hanging over the water's surface. Unlike before, the mist hadn't fully disappeared into the water.\n\nGuy reached out with his hands and grabbed the mist to try and disturb it in front of him; it was so heavy it was suffocating. Yet, the gaseous air did not behave as it should have. It started to stretch like an elastic solid until it reached a point of fracture and a chunk was torn off. In Guy's hands, the torn chunk started to liquefy and flowed through the gaps in his fingers. Once it was free, the dropping liquid deviated and merged with the gaseous mist in front of him.\n\n\"What is this thing?\"\n\nCurious, Guy proceeded to play around with the mist to understand its behaviour. Through some deduction, he could surmise that the illusion must have something to do with this mist.\n\nTreating it like Play-Doh, Guy pulled another chunk from the mist and started to mould it into something from his memory. Back when he used to teach kids at the kindergarten level, Guy encouraged the use of Play-Doh and homemade alternatives of it as supplements to learning. For children, it helps develop fine motor skills, and hand-eye coordination and encourages creativity. Through repeated use, Guy was somewhat of an expert in making models out of it.\n\nWithin minutes, a near realistic miniature elephant started to form in Guy's hands. The mist had a translucent off-white colour, but as the elephant's shape started to solidify, the colour of the mist also began to shift to match a greyish-brown hue of an actual pachyderm.\n\nWhen the final detail was placed on the model, a complete elephant took life in Guy's palms. With a comical poot, the elephant raised its elongated trunk and marched forward. It lifted off from Guy's palms and collapsed into the mist. The mist in turn cushioned its fall, and once the elephant landed, it was completed engulfed by and disappeared into it.\n\nSuddenly, as though a switch was flipped, a series of intuitions started to click in Guy's mind. These came in the form of instructions which told him how the mist functioned. This phenomenon was similar to how Markus gained the insight to tangle with spacetime and influence the gravitational fields around objects. It wasn't scientific, but it made sense.\n\nAn incredulous smile formed across Guy's face as he finally understood what the mist could do.\n\nHe immediately dispersed his meditative state and returned to his senses. In front of him, Markus and Jean on one side were exchanging spells against Al as the latter provided key pointers about how certain spell combinations could be used and how they could increase their efficacy.\n\nGuy ignored the trio and followed his intuition to pull the mana from his core. What Guy learned from his earlier revelation was that unlike with other mages, the liquid substance in the pool and the mist hanging over it were both the same.\n\nGuy moved the mana through his palms and exuded it outwards. On queue, a familiar mist started to pour out from his pores. This sudden change caught Al's attention, who paused the spar and asked.\n\n\"Did you find something?\"\n\n\"I did,\" Guy beamed back. \"I'm eager to test it. Are you up for a small experiment?\"\n\nAl simply smiled back in anticipation.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-190]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":28,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 188 - Combat Training","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nBreakfast was silent as the group was incomplete. Grace hadn't awoken yet, Guy figured that she was probably exhausted after unveiling her darkest secrets. Revisiting trauma was never pleasant, and oftentimes physically draining.\n\nA dismal ambience lingered around the dining table, even the usually upbeat Dora kept mum the entire time. She didn't even pester Kano to elaborate on his trip to the city. Markus ate his food mechanically, the same as Marie. Jean wore her usual impassive expression, yet her body language screamed discomfort. She could read the room and had no idea why such a dreary atmosphere pervaded it.\n\nGuy finished his food and placed his wooden spoon into his bowl.\n\n\"Markus, from today onwards we will add combat as part of our regular lesson rotation,\" Guy declared.\n\nThe eyes of his two students darted his way in disbelief. His disciple was also thoroughly floored by Guy's sudden announcement.\n\n\"Master? I'm not sure that I understand...\"\n\n\"We've been neglecting a key functionality of magic during our lessons. After our trip to the Cloudstrider Sect, it became clear to me that our approach was incorrect. Danger lurks behind every corner, we must be prepared to contend against such threats that target our lives and that of our loved ones. Although you succeeded this time, we also established that it was in large part due to your opponent's complacency. If there is one thing I know for a fact, is that there will never be second chances in life-\"\n\n'Lies!' Guy thought to himself. He was here right now in his second chance. 'But they don't know that. And maybe my second chance was also the first time. What guarantee is there that I or any of my students will get a second iteration?'\n\n\"Anyways, self-defence is a must-have skill for everyone. We will add combat to our usual physical training regiment.\"\n\n\"I understand, Master,\" Markus affirmed.\n\n\"Jean, I would like for you to attend as well. Although I cannot force you to participate, it would be beneficial for you to learn. As for you Marie-\"\n\n\"I will voluntarily sit out. I am learning to cultivate and practice magic to expressly avoid such scenarios,\" Marie interjected immediately while shaking her head. \"I don't want to give myself an out by supplementing myself with combat exercises. Besides, the old man keeps telling me that 'our way is to puncture with a borrowed knife' or something like that. He probably has other plans for me.\"\n\n\"Are you sure Big Sis?\" Markus inquired.\n\n\"A hundred per cent! This handicap will push my limits. I am sure of it!\"\n\n____\n\nA flurry of |Fireball|, |Ice Lance|, |Water Jet| and a plethora of other projectiles flew back and forth between two casters as a third individual observed unwaveringly. Almost akin to a turn-based game, the duo attacked and defended alternatingly. Each pushing their spellcasting and ingenuity to the limit to produce solutions on the fly. In one instance, a |Fireball| would be negated by another |Fireball|. In another, the |Fireball| would get pulled into |Wind Vortex| morphing it into a |Flame Spin| that spread outward with a shockwave.\n\nGuy and Markus, along with Jean, were in the usual clearing where they tested and practised spellcasting. Their previous location had undergone a thorough landscaping operation and thus they had to manually clear a section of the forest to create a new one. Today could be considered an inauguration of this new field, and it was already starting to look worn out due to the heavy pummelling from the rogue spells.\n\nBoth Markus and Guy had their wands out. Guy had built one for himself a while back when he made one for Jean and Marie. He'd mostly been using it for spells of convenience, either to clean the roof tiles of the orphanage or the stairs, maybe sweeping fallen leaves and dust. This spar was officially the first time the wand participated in actual combat. Needless to say, Guy was plenty impressed with his creation. He had tried the wand out to cast a few combat spells during its conception, but he hadn't used it in a high-stress situation. After actually doing so, he realised just how cheat-like it was. Certain spells which took a heavy toll on the mana pool were turned into trivial cantrips thanks to the wand. This was also in large part due to Markus' innovative Compartmentalisation algorithm that further enhanced Guy's Modular Spellmaking.\n\n\"If I were to describe it, I would say that our combat style is like a brute force attack, isn't it?\" Guy commented as he redirected a burst of water whipping from his blind side. \"We are leveraging our efficiency in spellcasting to overpower our opponents. There doesn't seem to be a technique to this.\"\n\n\"Technique is anything you want it to be,\" another voice responded. Neither Guy nor Markus had to divert their attention to know that it was Teacher Al Jeeves.\n\n\"I was wondering what all those mana fluctuations were. I must say, this is my first time seeing you so aggressive Guy,\" Al commented.\n\n\"Master is quite unrelenting,\" Markus chimed in as sweat started to form across his forehead. \"The spells are-\"\n\nA compressed vorticing ball of fiery gas propelled itself at Mach speeds towards Markus. Markus barely shifted his hips to the left and the ball flew past, missing him by a millimetre and collided against a tree on the other end of the field. As the ball hit the trunk, it expanded and exploded magnificently, taking with it a huge bite of the trunk. The tree fell after a second, as it finally realised that its body was suddenly missing.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" Guy asked. He could see the precision in Markus' movement. It was calculated- No! It was like he already knew the ball would follow that trajectory before it even left Guy's wand.\n\n\"I used the new sensory data that my mana sense can observe to predict the path,\" Markus answered truthfully.\n\n\"Really? Which new data channel is this?\"\n\n\"I believe it was what Master called Spacetime?\" Markus answered while scratching his head.\n\n\"WHAT?!\" Guy shrieked in surprise. \"How?\"\n\nMarkus smiled proudly and started to explain his process of stumbling across the new channel that led to his advancement into Foundation Establishment.\n\n\"You do realise just how risky your method was, right?\" Al reprimanded. \"Many mages have lost their sanity after delving into the information gathered from their mana sense. Nonetheless, your gains did end up outweighing the risks. Being able to access an exclusive sensory channel through the mana sense is a one-in-a-million ability held closely by specialised practitioners from deep-rooted clans, sects, or beings with special bloodlines and physiques. I caught a few glimpses of how you used this new sensory channel to your advantage in the fight against Cleo. Definitely handy! Although I don't know what else it offers you apart from an extremely precise view of your surroundings.\"\n\n\"You have no idea just how broken this is,\" Guy said to Al. \"Being able to observe spacetime, like actually seeing it, opens up a realm of new possibilities for Markus.\"\n\nHe then turned to the boy and asked, \"Have you found any interesting new uses?\"\n\nMarkus scratched his chin and said, \"It isn't exactly a spell, more like an ability- no, an intuition that I get when I sense spacetime. I can manipulate the meshgrid with my mana. The longer I do it, the more exhausted I get and it is highly exponential.\"\n\n\"Can you show me?\" Al inquired with interest sparkling in his eyes.\n\nMarkus nodded and said, \"Teacher Jeeves, please lower your guard for this one. I haven't tried it on someone two realms above me, I don't know if it will work.\"\n\nRight as Al obliged verbally, he could feel a minuscule change transpiring around him. He suddenly started to feel a fluctuation in his weight. Thanks to his cultivation realm, Al had a highly attuned sense of perception of himself. He had lived in this body for over a century now, needless to say, he knew every nook and cranny of it, from the length of his tone-nails to the number of eye-lashed on his left eye. The small disturbance in his weight was nigh-imperceptible but wasn't missed by him. He was lighter by exactly one kilogram.\n\nAfter a short second, the feeling reverted, but then pushed in the other direction. Instead of feeling lighter, he had gotten heavier.\n\n\"That is fascinating!\" Al congratulated. Markus stopped his ability acting on Al and diverted it to his Master\n\n\"That's freaky!\" Guy exclaimed.\n\n\"I used this to cause Cleo to lose her step during combat,\" Markus revealed.\n\n\"That's an excellent application!\" Al praised. \"Most combatants and martial artists learn how to react to changes in the environment. Missed footing, slips, obstacles, and so on. But no one really trains how to compensate for sudden changes in their internal model. Though I must say that it may not work so easily with veteran fighters. I highly suggest you figure out a way to augment this ability.\"\n\nMarkus nodded and said, \"I am searching for ways to formalise this. If I can translate this into a spell circle, I believe it will be even more efficient and tweakable.\"\n\n\"I bet this ability also gives you a lot of insights into that black hole spell you've been trying to cook up,\" Guy added.\n\n\"The boy calls it a |Singularity|. That's what I remembered hearing,\" Al chimed in.\n\n\"Was that English?\" Guy shot back incredulously.\n\nMarkus smiled bitterly and said, \"There were no apt words to describe it, so I used the word Master used to define a black hole.\"\n\n\"What's English?\" Al interjected. \"It's definitely not Ancient Tongue.\"\n\n\"It's the language that most of the insight in my inheritance is encrypted in,\" Guy lied without missing a beat. For the first time, he didn't feel any discomfort as it rolled out the tip of his tongue. The triviality of the process did unsettle Guy, but he quickly waved it away.\n\n\"I wouldn't be able to replicate that, right?\" Guy redirected immediately.\n\n\"I don't think so. The way Markus described it, this new ability is probably a byproduct of his specific cultivation method - whatever it is. It would be difficult for you to replicate it without going through a cultivation deviation. You could create an analogue if you tried, just like how Markus managed to create a pseudo replica of Gaige's attack. But creating the same would be extremely difficult.\" Al explained. \"In fact, you should probably have some special ability with your specialised cultivation method. Have you tried testing it out?\"\n\n\"My cultivation method?\" Guy blurted out. Frankly, he had no idea what it was either. How could he know what his special ability would be?\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-189]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":29,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 187 - Rage, Unending","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy returned to his room and went to bed. Sleep evaded him for a while until he caught it by force. It was difficult descent into the land of dreams, but Guy achieved it nonetheless.\n\nThe darkness wobbled and rippled like the surface of a still pond after an interloping pebble breached it. Guy felt a faint suction, and then a hard thud as he found himself deposited in an unknown place. The world around him was dim and dank. Drooping foliage surrounded him, like somewhere deep within a dense forest. Yet he could hear no fauna. He could hear nothing, except his heartbeats.\n\nThrown into an unknown home such as this, Guy surprisingly didn't panic. His perception told him that he had arrived here willingly. How? He did not know - he could not recollect. His memories only told him the validity of the current time instance, everything before was a blur. Guy's body acted on autopilot and trudged forward, through the shrubbery. Curving around the towering trees, ducking under the entangled vines, and leaping over the exposed roots.\n\nHe walked for an incalculable amount of time. He did not know how long because he did not feel any discomfort or tiredness. He didn't even know which direction he was going. He just followed where his feet took him.\n\nAt that instance, a pained whimper broke through the woods and assaulted his ears. It was faint, almost a whisper, but it resonated like large church bells in his mind. Once again, Guy's feet took over. With an increasing pace, which turned into a jog and then a sprint, he navigated through the maze with uncanny proficiency. \n\nThe sound repeated, but much louder this time. Maybe he was getting closer. Maybe the source was evoking the sound more frantically.\n\nThe whimper turned into a painful, soul-shattering cry. Guy's environment zoomed past him as he finally burst through the last layer of trees. He was now in front of a hill - bare except for the well-kept garden around it. At the tip of the hill, was a quaint cottage. Its facade beckoned with an inviting warmth, but through the ajar door, Guy could feel an abominable evil leaking through.\n\nAt this moment, Guy exited his autopilot state and his full consciousness was dropped into his body. His mind rumbled and whirred into motion.\n\n\"Where am I?\" He muttered. And in response, another shrieking cry for help resounded. It was coming from inside the cottage.\n\nThe voice sounded young, feminine, but hoarse. Almost as though it had been put through the wringer many times before. It was heartrending to hear.\n\nGuy gulped audibly as a realisation dawned upon him. He could already imagine what he was witnessing. This place, this cottage, that sound. But he didn't want to believe it.\n\n\"It's all a lie. This is just a dream,\" he repeated. Often acknowledging that one was in a dream was enough to give them full control over the environment. Guy kept telling himself that it was all a figment of his overactive imagination. But his subconscious was unwilling to concede control. The ambience remained static, and the wailing voice boomed within his mind. Shaking him to his core.\n\nUnable to take it any longer, Guy started to walk briskly up the hill and approached the cottage. As he approached, the agonising screams started to claw into him mentally and emotionally. Guy couldn't hold himself back, his blood was pumping and his rage was boiling over. Not once had Guy ever felt this way in his entire life, not in this one and definitely not in his previous one.\n\nHe forced himself into a sprint and burst into the house, pushing through the door with his shoulder. With an audible bang, the door flung open and flew off the hinge.\n\nWith veins popping out of his eyeballs, Guy scanned the room. His ears perked up and searched for the source of the sound. But he was only greeted with silence - ear-shattering silence.\n\nThe anger in his heart started to fester. What sort of games was his mind playing? He collapsed to his knees and started to pummel the ground furiously. Each punch caused the world around him to shake. The madness locked inside him started to burst out. He did not know how else to express it except by physically venting it.\n\nThe anger was unending and as he released it, more formed and took its place. Guy was thoroughly shaken to his core after hearing Grace's revelations. He only wore a calm facade as a mask. Deep down, he was infuriated. He wanted nothing more than to find the man who hurt her and twist his neck. No, that would be too quick. Too easy. If the world was fair, there had to be retribution!\n\n\"AAARGGHH!\" Guy bellowed as he brought both his fists down.\n\nBOOOM!\n\nDust tumbled from the ceiling and cracks started to spread out all over the floor, originating at the point of impact.\n\n\"This is a first,\" a voice commented.\n\nGuy jerked his head sideways and looked into the darkness surrounding him. Even though the cottage had windows, no light graced its interior. The only source of light was the entryway through which Guy burst in. From the shadows bathing the room, a figure stepped out.\n\nGuy's eyes widened in shock as the figure's face peeked through.\n\n\"It's you!\"\n\n\"It's me!\" the other Guy parroted with a joking intonation. \"You feel anger. Why is that?\"\n\nGuy didn't respond. He stared incredulously at the familiar form of his past self.\n\n\"Even when the mother and her two daughters died at the hands of the abusive man, you didn't feel an inkling of rage. Yet now, all of sudden, your heart aches and your soul quakes. Why is that?\"\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Guy retorted.\n\n\"Why can't I be here? I am you, you are me. I am where you are, everywhere, all the time,\" the other Guy responded.\n\nThen, silence prevailed in the room.\n\n\"Why do you look so shocked? Did you think that I was confined behind that mask?\" The other Guy mocked. \"That mask is the portal to let me enter the foreground, when in fact I exist eternally in the background.\"\n\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\" Guy barked back infuriated.\n\nThe other Guy shrugged and said, \"Let's call it an experiment. I wanted to test something. I wanted to gauge your reaction.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"What were you expecting to see when you ran in here?\" The other Guy redirected. \"Were you hoping to see the face of the man that defiled that woman? For the sake of argument, what would you have done if you saw the man here forcing himself upon that girl? Would you have stopped him, or would you have remained passive as you usually do?\"\n\n\"Stop joking around with me.\"\n\n\"Come on now, humour me for a second.\"\n\n\"Of course, I would have stopped him!\"\n\n\"At what point would you stop?\" The other Guy hinted.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nThe other Guy waited for the mumbling Guy to format his answer. But after minutes of inactivity, he said, \"You know that you must kill him. Would you be able to do it though?\"\n\n\"I would,\" Guy answered with a resolute expression. His face stuck somewhere between a concerned frown and cold, calculated decisiveness.\n\n\"Ain't that intriguing,\" the other Guy said sarcastically. \"Saint Larks, willing to draw blood? Stop kidding yourself! You couldn't hurt a mosquito sucking your blood in front of you. What confidence is there in annihilating someone else - a human no less?\"\n\n\"He is no human. He is a monster. An inhumane monster. And he should be treated as such. What he did to Grace... it is unforgivable.\"\n\n\"With what strength? You talk a big game, but when push comes to shove would you even have the power to enact your decisions?\" The other Guy challenged.\n\n\"The congregation you are creating for our Church, do you think you can protect it from the infidels who seek to demean and destroy us?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"THE SECT! You act so enthusiastically, but you seem to forget that a Sect is a mercenary group at heart. Mercenary work involves fighting, maiming, and killing. Can you even do it?\"\n\n\"If I must.\"\n\n\"Talk is cheap.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?!\" Guy shot back.\n\n\"If you let me have control. I will solve everything for you,\" the other Guy tempted. \"This revenge would be the top priority. After all, there is no place for selfish deviants in a world built on the Absolute Truth.\"\n\n\"Enough!\" Guy demanded. \"Release this farce this instant.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do it!\"\n\nThe other Guy did not respond and simply dissipated. Guy's anger returned twofold. In a fit, he rushed towards the walls of the cottage and flung his fist against it. A fist-sized hole formed as the wood shattered. With another punch, the structure buckled. Guy did not pause and resumed the rage-filled demolition operation.\n\nHe then beelined to the sleeping quarters. To his disgust, he found that there was only one. Which meant that the man slept with her from the start. He probably shared the bed with her, endearing himself with the innocent child. Lowering her guard!\n\nWith another primal scream, Guy grabbed the mattress and bedframe, and cleft it in two. He proceeded to pummel the walls, hell-bent on destroying the disgusting place.\n\nOnce the cottage was no more, he moved on to the garden. He uprooted and burned the fields. He then desiccated the soil, removing all beneficial minerals from it. He then proceeded to pummel the ground, levelling the hill.\n\nGuy's carnage extended outwards. He fell the trees and burned everything to ashes. His anger knew no bounds. He did not want this awful place to exist in his mind. Even a remnant of it, be it a figment, was disgusting.\n\nAfter what felt like years, Guy stopped and beheld the carnage he had wrought. The world was burning around him. The ground was charred with soot and debris. The skin of his fist had torn in many places. His bones were showing, blood was caked everywhere. Yet Guy still hadn't found peace. It was just that there was nothing else to vent it out on.\n\nGuy reined back his anger and sat down into a meditative pose. He slowly descended into a deep trancelike state, until he suddenly felt a pop.\n\nGuy opened his eyes and stared blankly at the ceiling of his room. The first rays of the sun peeked through his windows and tumbled across his face.\n\nGuy held his face in his hands and took a few deep breaths to suppress his emotions. The anger hadn't subsided. It was just that there was nothing else to vent it out on. Nothing justifiable, at least. Not yet.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-188]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":30,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 186 - Vow","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\"You don't mean...?\" Guy exclaimed in disbelief. He hoped, deep inside, that everything was a lie. For Grace to have suffered through something so malicious, something so disgusting, something so absolutely inhumane... Guy just couldn't digest it. For that matter, even the food he'd consumed was attempting to redouble out of his oesophagus.\n\n\"The day I menstruated for the first time, my Mas- that man... took me. He forced himself on me,\" Grace revealed with a low whimper. She paused to collect herself and continued to speak. However, Guy could feel the heavy emotions gushing through her words and her deep-seated fear and anger.\n\n\"I had no idea what was going on. I was too young and I didn't know what it meant. I just let him do it, I bit my lips and forged through the pain. 'Maybe it was part of Master's plan?' I would lie to myself,\" Grace said. \"But I knew, deep down, that it was wrong.\"\n\n\"He... did that to me many times, every time I menstruated. After the first time, he would lock me in the hut. He stopped teaching me how to cultivate as well. It went on like this for a year, until one day my menstruation was delayed.\"\n\n\"I didn't know what to do. I didn't have anyone to depend on, so I told that man. When he heard it, he was extremely elated.\"\n\n\"After that incident, a change took place. My treatment took another turn, this time for the better. He would feed me delicious food, and varieties of elixirs, I also received physical therapy regularly. As an impressionable child, my growing apprehension lessened as I believed that my Master was back to normal. I thought that maybe he was angry with me for something I did before, and now he had forgiven me. Yet, I overlooked the fact that he still kept me locked up in this prison.\"\n\n\"Then time progressed, and I started to notice my cultivation dropping at a frantic pace. It was slow at first, but with each month it started to decrease exponentially, until the fifth month when I had returned to my mortal state, but much worse. I couldn't feel the mana at all, I couldn't even cast basic cantrips.\"\n\n\"Once again, I told the man about this. And that was the last time I saw his face,\" Grace concluded.\n\n\"When I next I woke up, I found that I was alone in that house. I was weak, on the brink of death. My stomach was scarred with a brutal burn. My insides were on fire. And worse yet, I could feel that I had lost something. There was an emptiness inside me.\"\n\nGrace stopped talking and rolled over to her side.\n\n\"I remained in the house alone for a week. My mind was blank. I was lost. A part of me was angry with myself for disappointing my Master which resulted in this punishment. 'Why did he leave me? What did I do wrong?' I started to hate myself. It got to a point when I contemplated ending everything. But then I remembered my parents.\"\n\n\"With great difficulty, I managed to recuperate. Thanks to the knowledge that man left with me, and the still intact herb garden, I managed to brew a few healing concoctions and regained some of my strength. But mana manipulation was still beyond my reach. No matter! I just had to return home, to my parents.\"\n\n\"I travelled for days, fighting through the pain from the hasty healing that man did to me. I guess once I had fulfilled my use, my fate didn't matter to him. Though, I am thankful that he at least put me back together in one piece after slicing me up. If he hadn't done that, I would not be here.\"\n\n\"By the time I returned to my village, I found that it no longer existed.\"\n\nGrace chuckled ominously and said, \"What happened, was that a few years after my departure, a mage garbed in black arrived at the village and burnt it to the ground, including everyone present there at that time.\"\n\n\"It couldn't be!\" Guy denied it in shock.\n\n\"The assumption is valid,\" Grace responded. \"He couldn't leave any loose ends. He was sure that I wouldn't survive his operation. But what of the people from my past? If people started asking questions, they could trace it back to him, right?\"\n\n\"I lost everything. My past, my present, and my future. At this point, I was nothing but a ghost. I might as well be dead,\" Grace cried.\n\n\"I wanted to end it all,\" Grace revealed. \"Finish what that man did to me.\"\n\n\"But then, I met Markus. He was a little kid, alone. Almost my age when I was taken. Being with him, this emptiness that remained within me started to fill up - I could feel it. Maybe it was the lingering motherly instinct that was growing inside me that found some satisfaction and wholeness when taking care of the kid...\"\n\n\"It was just us two for a while. But as he grew older and older, the anger, hatred and disgust started to resurface within me. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat without throwing it all up, I couldn't even get up due to the lethargy.\"\n\n\"It was then that I stumbled upon Dora and Kano. Those two were even younger than Markus when I found him. Still toddlers, barely able to crawl. After I took them in, the pain within me receded again. A few months later, Marie joined us and we finally settled down here in this building. The villagers had abandoned this place for many years. The woods were dense here, and prone to beast attacks.\"\n\n\"But we had nothing to lose. We moved in, cleaned and cleared the area,\" Grace explained.\n\n\"Now this is all I have, Guy. The children and this place. This was all that kept me going. It was all that I needed. But, that was until you came,\" Grace said while sobbing loudly.\n\n\"I disliked you when you arrived,\" Grace confessed. \"You reminded me of my unpleasant past. You reminded me of him.\"\n\nAt that instant, pieces started to click in Guy's mind. Her murderous reaction when she saw Guy naked with Markus started to make sense to him now. It must have opened up all of her past wounds when she thought that Guy was about to do to Markus what the beast had done to her.\n\n\"You're thinking about that time, aren't you?\" Grace asked. She could read Guy's facial expressions and deduced them accurately.\n\n\"You were different,\" Grace redirected. \"I'd met a lot of mages through my life. Each was equally as bad as the other - they were all the same. Selfish, arrogant, quick to anger, and just as quick to jump to conclusions. But you were the exact opposite. I thought it was a result of a naive mind, but after getting to know you, I realised that it was a result of a mind mature beyond its years.\"\n\n\"You flatter me.\"\n\n\"It's the truth! I was apprehensive about sending Markus to the Academy because I feared he would become like them - cold, uncaring and self-absorbed. You wouldn't believe just how relieved I was when he came back - although I didn't show it. But then he brought you along... I prepared myself for the worst but was pleasantly surprised. I observed as you taught Markus and the other kids, and how you emphasised the use of rationality and morality - being aware of how our actions affect the world and those around us.\"\n\nGrace sat up on her mattress and gazed directly into Guy's eyes. Her face wore a firm and unbending expression, and she grasped Guy's hand tightly.\n\n\"I will let you establish your Sect here only under one condition: You mustn't let the kids joining go astray. Keep them grounded, just like you did with Markus, Jean and Marie. Turn them into exemplary mages.\"\n\n\"Does that even need to be said?\" Guy retorted incredulously. \"I won't let them go astray. Not in good conscience.\"\n\nGrace shook her head and repeated, \"You don't understand. Magic corrupts. As you grow with your cultivation your personality warps with you. After a point, you are forced to sacrifice the only shred of humanity that tethers you to your mortal self and you turn into an abstract concept given physical form. And once you lose that human identity, you stop treating others as humans as well.\"\n\n\"The way you're raising Markus and the others, I can get behind. In fact, I would have interrupted the moment you started leading them astray, but till now you haven't. However, with a growing body of students, your attention will inevitably become diluted. So, I need you to promise me! Promise me that you won't let ANY child learning under you go astray. Promise me, and I will let you use the orphanage and the surrounding areas to set up your Sect.\"\n\nGuy gazed back into Grace's eyes and prepared to pledge. \"I promise that no member of my Sect will ever, in any way, turn to harm innocents. I will make sure that they become whole individuals with a proper sense of morality.\"\n\nThe duo remained in silence as the vow lingered in the air. It may not be much, it wasn't like it was some sort of soul contract, but the words had weight. At least to Grace, it was enough. She trusted Guy. Why? Grace didn't know the answer to that question.\n\nIt might be because he never forced anything on her. He respected her - respected her boundaries, her choices, and her opinions. He treated her as his equal. That was not something you'd find so easily in this world.\n\nAnother reason might be because, in an obscure way, Grace also reciprocated the affection Guy kept sending her way. If someone were to hear the words 'I Love You' multiple times from the same person with sincerity, unless the recipient was without emotions, they too would become swayed and develop some feelings for that person.\n\nProximity breeds familiarity. And Grace was growing intimately familiar with Guy.\n\nAfter a silent few minutes, Grace snapped out of her focused state and realised that she and Guy were extremely close to each other, AND she was holding on to the man's hands. If anyone were to enter her room at this moment, misunderstandings would surely arise.\n\nShe immediately dropped her hands and coughed to cover up her embarrassment.\n\n\"I- I should sleep now,\" she muttered and urged Guy to do the same... in his own room.\n\n\"Before I go,\" Guy said as he passed her door frame. \"If it isn't too unpleasant, what was the name of that man who did this to you? Can you describe him?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Grace choked at the sudden change in ambience. \"I am not sure. He called himself Yarrick, though he just told me to call him Master. And as for his appearance... the memories are sort of blurry. I've been trying my hardest to forget...\"\n\nGuy furrowed his brows as he digested this information and then revealed a slight smile back at Grace, \"It's fine. Good night.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-187]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":31,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 185 - Cursed","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nA six-year-old girl, with two sharp chestnut-brown eyes glowing with the innocence of childhood, crouched down and inspected a multi-coloured flower in bloom. She used her stubby index finger to tilt it to the side and observed the integrity of the flower's stem. Noticing the excessive elasticity of the stem, she pulled back her hand and scratched her chin in thought.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" An adult's voice asked, shocking the girl out of her ponderance. The girl turned to face the source and revealed a smile so bright that it could block out a hundred suns.\n\n\"Master!\" The girl cheered and skipped toward the man. He had the appearance of someone in their forties, with a chiselled goatee, brunette hair that was tied into a bun and hazel eyes. He wore a loose white cotton collarless shirt that descended till his knees, and equally loose sandal-coloured trousers of the same material. He descended to his knees and met the girl at eye level.\n\n\"What's gotten you so stressed out, my little Disciple?\" The man inquired mirthfully.\n\n\"The Auroral Lily's nutritional intake seems stunted,\" the girl answered with a pout as she rubbed her muddy hands on her plain jute summer dress.\n\n\"Have patience,\" the man said with a warm smile. \"We've only just replanted it. The soil environment in this region already has a significantly higher mineral content, on top of the vitality-rich fertiliser we're using. The Lily grows in a tundra biome under much scarcer conditions. You shouldn't be worried about it not receiving enough nutrition. Besides, everything takes time. Remember the first month after you moved in with me? How did you feel then?\"\n\nThe girl smiled wryly and said, \"That's not fair! I was only missing my parents...\"\n\n\"Maybe this flower is also missing its parents. Give it some time, it will come to liven up,\" the man added while gently patting the worried girl's head. The girl beamed back a smile in response, failing to realise the man's hand's incremental descent down her spine to the small of her back.\n\n\"Guess what Master found today?\" The man asked with exaggerated intrigue.\n\nThe girl frowned as she tried guessing, but before she could voice it, the man pulled out a simple, yet elegant gold necklace.\n\n\"Wow!\" The girl's eyes widened like saucers as the gold glimmered in the morning sun's bright rays.\n\nThe man proceeded to put the necklace on the girl by first moving her flowing locks. His hands contacted her neck, revealing her collarbones cushioned with baby fat. He placed the gold metal on her neck and slowly fastened it from behind.\n\n\"This Master is so lucky! He has the most beautiful Disciple in the whole wide world!\" The man declared loudly.\n\nThe girl blushed in response and hid her face in embarrassment.\n\n____\n\n\"Master, when can we go to the city?\" The girl asked. She was now ten years old, and her face was in the process of shedding its fat.\n\n\"Why do you want to leave?\" The man shot back with a faint yet harsh edge in his voice.\n\n\"It's been so long. I want to eat those Sweet Dumplings you brought last time,\" the girl said with a hopeful gaze.\n\n\"Why would you need to go to the city for that?\" The man shot back as he approached the girl from behind. He placed his hands on her waist and rested his chin on her head. \"Master will make it for you.\"\n\nThe girl flinched slightly as the man's breath brushed against her scalp. She had spent five years with her Master, isolated on this hill in the middle of a forest. She had tried leaving many times - in the beginning, it was due to boredom. But in the past few years, a sense of foreboding had dawned upon her. She felt trapped. Suffocated.\n\nOver the years, she and her Master had gotten closer... on an uncomfortably physical level largely due to her Master's aggressive advances. She felt discomfited and anxious, but her Master would tell her that it was all innocent. They were just normal interactions between Master and Disciple, he would say.\n\n\"How's your cultivation moving?\" the man inquired, now whispering directly into her ears. The girl shuffled away and bowed respectfully. \"Thanks to Master's teachings, this Disciple was able to achieve a breakthrough and advance into the cusp of the Core Formation realm. Just like Master said, ingesting that potion made of Auroral Lily invigorated my blood and pushed me past that barrier.\"\n\nThe man's eyes flashed with malicious greed but were immediately replaced with warm pride. She didn't miss this instance, though. Recently, she had noticed her Master's gaze and expressions waver, exhibiting a dangerous glint intermittently.\n\n\"That's good! Congratulations, my beautiful Disciple!\" The man exclaimed as he reached in for a hug.\n\nThe girl's spine tightened at the words 'beautiful Disciple'. A compliment should elicit a more pleasant response, but after hearing it so many times, each time with more lustful vitriol than the last, she was starting to hate it. She didn't believe it anymore. She hated her hourglass figure, her piercing gaze, and her inviting features. Everything her Master used to describe her allure had turned into knives carving into her spirit.\n\n____\n\n\"AH!\" The girl screamed as she beheld the gory mess on her bed. Blood. Blood everywhere. Hearing the scream, her Master rushed into her room.\n\n\"What happened?\" He asked. But his eyes landed on the girl's bed.\n\n\"It's okay. It's a natural process,\" the man assuaged the shaken girl. He approached her bed and folded the bedspread. With a flick of his hands, the cloth disintegrated. With another flick, the blood that oozed into her mattress dissipated as well.\n\n\"See? As good as new!\" He exclaimed with a flourish of his hands.\n\nThe girl looked apprehensively at her Master and cowered.\n\n\"Don't be scared, Grace,\" her Master said. \"It's a good sign. It means that my beautiful Disciple - the most wonderful girl in the world - has now become a woman.\"\n\nGrace looked into her Master's eyes and saw his facade slip completely. No longer did he bother to wear the mien of a proud Master, a caring father figure, and a close friend. His eyes lost all of their warmth and were replaced by a maddened, avaricious and lecherous intensity.\n\n\"Master?\" Grace whimpered as she saw the man she called Master approach her. His gait was that of a predator. And she was his prey.\n\n____\n\nSilence reigned in Grace's room, as she paused. Her voice remained stoic and uncaring the entire time she narrated her past. She was picked up by a seemingly kind-hearted Mage who unearthed her from her village and took her on as his Disciple. He convinced her parents that she had immense potential and would one day soar through the skies. As illiterate folk, gaining the recognition of a Mage was a massive boon. They readily sent their daughter with the Mage. After all, the best they could give her would be just enough food to survive the day. At least with this Master, their daughter could thrive and not just survive.\n\nGrace's Master took her to his \"home\" which was an isolated cottage up a hill, surrounded by dense forestry on all sides. There was an artificial spring flowing through the area that was used to irrigate and tend to a garden that grew a myriad of herbs, flowers and alchemical ingredients. Her Master taught her everything about growing herbs and cultivating. Grace showed immense potential and breezed through cultivation realms with minimal effort, going as far as to reach Foundation Establishment by six and a half years of age.\n\n\"Have you ever heard of Lamias?\" Grace asked. \"They're a type of nature spirit - sentient creatures native to the Fae Realm. One key biological trait of Lamias is that they're always females.\"\n\n\"They are known to be extremely powerful, capable of wielding the force of nature with a high level of proficiency. A Lamia in the Core Condensation realm can control a forest the size of Radiant City as if it were her own playground. A Lamia is born with an innate cultivation method, like most sentient beasts, that can boost her to the Core Condensation realm incredibly quickly. For others, it may take years or lifetimes, but for a Lamia, a decade would be sufficient.\"\n\n\"Yet, even with all this power, a Lamia has one glaring weakness,\" Grace paused.\n\n\"You see, the moment a Lamia becomes pregnant, she loses everything. Her cultivation is immediately dissipated, never to be regained again, and all of it is transferred to her offspring. Since Lamias are only females, their offsprings are also exclusively females, and they are always born as twins. No matter what race the other half of the offspring may be, Lamia's bloodline supersedes all. Her offspring will be just as strong as her, and will have the same weakness as her.\"\n\nGrace turned her face on her pillow and looked directly into Guy's eyes.\n\n\"What happens to a mage's core when they die?\"\n\n\"It starts to dissipate,\" Guy answered.\n\n\"For a Lamia, once she becomes pregnant, her core gets infused into her offsprings. If one were to extract the offspring from her womb, refine them and siphon their essence through alchemical processes, they can create an extremely potent elixir that can boost a mage's cultivation by a lot. For a Mana Condensation realm mage, it would be enough to deposit them on the doorstep of Core Formation. For a peak Core Formation realm mage, it would be enough to boost them into the Core Condensation realm,\" Grace concluded.\n\nShe then moved her hands towards her belly and slowly pulled up her shirt, to reveal a horrible burn scar marring her abdomen.\n\n\"What my 'Master' didn't tell me when he picked me up, was that I had Lamia blood flowing through my veins.\" Grace's voice wavered as tears started to flow out the side of her eyes. \"All that time, I was so excited when my cultivation leapt through realms. He would praise me, and commend me for being a genius. Little did I know that it was all a lie - an unfortunate byproduct of my cursed bloodline.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-186]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":32,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 184 - Grace Opens Up","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nThe trio's return to the orphanage was wholly uneventful. To avoid scaring the populace again, Al decided it would be best to alight from Garrud a few kilometres away from the village. Once they arrived at the orphanage, it was already evening and the sun was just dipping over the horizon. Although the trip ended with a mild high, overall it was a bit depressing and no one was in the mood to eat at this point.\n\nGuy returned to his room and sat down by his floor-level desk. The delve into the Cloudstrider Sect's archive was eye-opening. The subsequent discussion with Markus during their flight back complemented his findings and established one key fact: that sects were just horrible!\n\nIf the Cloudstrider Sect was an exhibit of what a sect could be at its peak, Guy wanted none of it.\n\n\"Although I am left with no options but to start my own sect, it doesn't mean that I must conform to the existing norms,\" Guy concluded. Following the age-old adage 'if it ain't broke, why fix it?', people stuck to the current sect model because it worked well enough for them. And even though the threat of Academies did spur them to make some changes, the ones they implemented were negligible because, in the grand scheme of things, the group that sects catered to were often the weak and underprivileged who had no option but to enter servitude if they ever hoped to exit their station.\n\n\"Incidentally, the unfortunate and underprivileged are the market segment I will be catering to.\" He couldn't afford to rope members with significant financial, political or martial power bases. And honest, Guy didn't want to do it either, \"That's just too much stress.\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" Guy stopped himself from thinking any further. He had subconsciously entered the future-planning mode. Before he could preoccupy himself with questions like, 'What will the name of my Sect be?' or 'What should my Sect layout be?', he had to tackle the most important question of them all.\n\n\"Where will the Sect even be?\"\n\nIt all boiled down to real estate. Guy wasn't knowledgeable about the price of real estate in the Solar Empire. Heck, he didn't know how to go about it either! Was the land owned by the Emperor or the Feudal Clans that managed their designated region? Would he need to communicate with a broker of some sort? What about tax? Above all that, how much land or space would he even need for his Sect?\n\n\"Busy, busy, busy,\" Guy repeated as he scratched his head in frustration. \"Nope! I can't procrastinate on this. I will hitch a ride to Radiant City first thing tomorrow morning. It will also allow me to check how much money I have accumulated in my account.\"\n\nAs Guy mentally laid out his plans for the following days, three equally-spaced and succinct knocks drew out his attention. He extended his mana sense and recognised that it was Grace.\n\n\"Come in,\" he called out.\n\nThe door opened slowly, and Grace's figure appeared through it. Guy observed her body language and expression and frowned. Unlike her usual firm and upbeat aura, a sense of defeat and sorrow hung over her. She was fidgeting while scratching at her elbows, she was avoiding Guy's gaze, she was biting her lips, and her shoulders were drooping.\n\n\"What's the matter? Sit, sit,\" Guy gestured as he tossed a cushion in front of his desk for her. Grace nodded and sat down before Guy.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Guy probed with a concerned gaze.\n\n\"I...\" Grace spoke up with a nearly inaudible volume. \"Markus just told me that you were thinking of starting your own Sect?\"\n\nGuy slapped his forehead, \"Right! I almost forgot to tell you.\"\n\n\"You told everyone else, but me. Even Dora and Kano knew about it, and Kano only just arrived yesterday,\" Grace added with a dull tone.\n\n\"I... I'm sorry,\" Guy said sincerely.\n\n\"He said that you might be leaving the orphanage as well?\" Grace asked.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Guy said as he pulled the corners of his lips into his cheeks submissively\n\n\"Why are you apologising?\" Grace retorted.\n\n\"Because...\" Guy didn't know how to answer that question. He was apologising for keeping Grace in the shadow. But why though? Truthfully, their relationship was similar to that of roommates sharing a home. Grace shouldn't feel so offended and dismayed over a small oversight such as Guy forgetting to reveal that he would move out sometime in the future. Yet why did Guy get the feeling that Grace was hurt?\n\nGrace started chuckling. Her laughter started to grow in amplitude until it reached a manic pitch. Then Grace cupped her face and muffled her laughter. Eventually, her apparent mirth warped into a cry of deep sadness and shame. She was now weeping. Her shoulders that jumped with delight just a second back now did the same with each whimper she released.\n\n\"Grace?\" Guy was alarmed at the sudden turnabout. The multiple shifts in the atmosphere within the span of a minute were so rapid that his thoughts were still buffering. He couldn't compute his next actions and was stuck staring at the weeping woman with his hands suspended in the air.\n\nGrace pulled in a deep breath through her nose to clear her nasal canals and then used her cuffs to dab her falling tears.\n\n\"You are a horrible man, Guy Larks. Do you know that?\" Grace said with a bitter smile.\n\n\"I shouldn't have let you stay here. I should have kicked you out the moment you arrived at our doorstep with Markus,\" Grace continued angrily.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Guy repeated.\n\n\"For what?\" Grace retorted back. \"Tell me, why are you sorry?\"\n\nGuy remained silent. The words that were at the tip of his tongue slithered back down his throat. He knew for a fact that his answer wasn't what Grace was looking for.\n\n\"If you leave, I will have nothing left Guy Larks!\" Grace bellowed ragefully.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Guy blurted out in shock.\n\n\"You came into our life- my life and integrated yourself so seamlessly,\" Grace expounded. \"Markus is your Disciple, he goes where you go. Marie is Mage Nara's Disciple, she goes where he goes, and as per Markus, he is bound to follow you wherever you plan to set up your Sect. Besides, that girl sees you as a father figure and someone to depend on - something I couldn't be for her. Dora and Kano, the only things those two ever talk about nowadays are all the interesting and mind-boggling things you've been teaching them. If you were to leave tomorrow, who do you think will remain in this orphanage?\"\n\n\"Grace...\"\n\n\"Just me!\" Grace answered herself while gritting her teeth. \"And do you want to hear something funny? When I heard that you might be leaving soon, do you know what saddened me the most? No! It wasn't the fact that I would be left by myself in this orphanage, but it was the fact that I wouldn't get to see you again!\"\n\nA heavy silence grasped the room as Grace finished the sentence with an incredulous pitch. \n\n\"Why do I feel this way, Guy? What did you do to me?\" Grace asked with a manic gaze.\n\n\"I was just... there I guess,\" Guy muttered.\n\n\"Why are you leaving me, Guy?\" Grace parroted with an increasingly detached tone, with a growing sense of hysteria in his voice. \"Is it because I'm useless?\"\n\nGrace pulled her knees towards her chest and hugged it tightly. \"I'm sorry. Please don't leave me...\"\n\n\"Grace?\" Guy approached the rocking woman carefully. \"Relax. It's okay.\"\n\nRight as his arms were about to hold her shaking shoulders, Grace screeched in fear, \"Don't hurt me! Please! AAAH!\"\n\nHer voice was loud, and it echoed all across the orphanage, rousing Markus and Marie who rushed over immediately.\n\n\"Master?!\" Markus was the first to arrive and was immediately followed by Marie.\n\n\"I-\"\n\n\"It's okay Teacher Larks,\" Marie assuaged. \"Please help me take her to her room.\"\n\n____\n\n\"It's happened before, hasn't it?\" Guy broke the silence inside Grace's room. He was with Marie, facing the now calm and unconscious body of Grace.\n\n\"A few times,\" Marie answered. \"She would wake up in the middle of the night. Wailing fearfully, grasping her legs just like before and cowering in the corner of the room.\"\n\n\"Do you know why?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"Everyone has their story,\" Marie replied. \"Everyone here's suffered in one way or another.\"\n\n\"She didn't tell you?\"\n\n\"I didn't ask,\" Marie shook her head.\n\n\"But this isn't healthy. She needs to work out whatever is eating away at her,\" Guy reasoned.\n\n\"Who can she talk to?\" Marie retorted. \"Not me. I'm just as broken as Matron Reva,\" she chuckled.\n\n\"Not Markus either. That boy doesn't understand women at all,\" Marie added. \"The twins are just kids.\"\n\n\"You know, Teacher Larks,\" Marie pivoted. \"In the years that I've known Matron Reva, I haven't seen her more emotive and relaxed than in the last year - after you came in.\"\n\n\"Anyways, I'm going back to bed,\" Marie said with a loud yawn. \"See you tomorrow, Teacher Larks. Good night!\"\n\nGuy hummed in response but didn't leave Grace's bedside. His gaze alternated between affection and concern as he saw her tranquil face. In truth, her earlier outburst had alarmed him. While he respected her privacy before and avoided egging her to reveal her history, he was now completely invested and wanted to know more so that he could help her.\n\n\"Guy?\" Grace murmured.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Are you there?\"\n\n\"I'm here.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"You can build your Sect here,\" Grace said.\n\n\"I don't want to inconvenience you,\" Guy responded.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"I know that you hate Mages,\" Guy redirected.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Do you want to know why?\" Grace asked.\n\nGuy hummed and shuffled closer.\n\n\"I'll tell you, but in the end I want you to promise me something. Can you do that?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nGrace raised her right hand and extended her pinky finger. Guy stared blankly at that action until it finally hit him. She was asking him to form a 'Pinky Swear'. It wasn't a gesture that originally existed in this world. Guy introduced it to his younger students and now most of the villagers did it. Funnily, they assumed that the swear was some kind of archaic mage ritual.\n\n\"Make the contract,\" Grace said. \"Pinky swear that you will keep that promise.\"\n\nGuy held in a chuckle and acquiesced by locking his own pinky around Grace's.\n\n\"I pinky swear!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-185]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":33,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 183 - (Interlude) Leaving the Cloudstrider Sect","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nGuy returned the final book from the Archive back into its place on the bookshelf. The expressions on his face alternated between satisfaction, disgust and hopefulness.\n\nHe was satisfied that he managed to consume all the books present within the time frame, which was beyond his initial estimate. The more he could add to the RoK, the greater his knowledge pool would be in the future that is to come. Speed-reading, like any skill, can be improved upon through practice and repetition. Guy's initial estimate was based on his first try, however, as he read more and more his mind and body became more accustomed to the action and his speed gradually increased.\n\nHe was disgusted by some of the unethical practices endorsed by the Sect. The Archives didn't go into much detail, but Guy was able to infer things by piecing together hints from multiple documents. One of the most horrendous actions Guy found was when an inheritance ground, which is a type of inheritance artefact that takes the form of a micro-dimension, opened up in the middle of the Vast Blue Expanse to the East.\n\nIt was discovered by a gaggle of crab fishermen whose ship got stranded on the island where the inheritance ground existed due to a wild hurricane. Word got out, and all the sects around the world rushed to claim it for their own. After a series of conflicts between members up the hierarchy, the rights to the ground were won by the Solar Alliance of Sects.\n\nMembers from the various sects of the alliance arrived in droves. It was commonly known that inheritance grounds were treacherous domains filled with dangers of many kinds. It was very rare for an Ascended mage to leave behind a benign artefact due to the volatile nature of cultivation and magic. Thus, the Sects would send in the grunts from the Outer Domain as cannon fodder to clear out and map the regions inside the grounds. Many would die, some painlessly while others not so much. Those that survived would live to see another day, albeit scarred for life. Those that were lucky and found something beneficial would ultimately lose it to those higher up the ladder.\n\nThe documents in the Archive didn't even deign to name the hundreds of lives lost during that venture to map the inheritance ground. It disgusted Guy to no end.\n\nUltimately though, this was an eye-opening trip for Guy. He felt hopeful about creating his Sect. He wanted to do better, he planned to use the information gleaned from these archives to build a Sect he could be proud of.\n\nRight as Guy entered an imaginative trance, he felt his body getting warped in place. The world around him wavered, blurred and stabilised all within one second. The feeling was similar to the teleportation Guy though when traversing between Karmin's shop in Radiant City and his Headquarters.\n\nOnce his vision cleared, Guy noticed that he was outside the Archives, facing the massive doors leading into it. Guy frowned and muttered, \"The full six hours haven't elapsed yet. What happened?\"\n\n\"We have to leave,\" Al answered from behind him. Guy smiled and turned to face Markus, Al, and Marek. The last presence came as a surprise because the group's body language felt friendlier all of a sudden, unlike the antagonistic vibe that persisted during their initial encounter. Evidently, something had transpired that changed the relationship dynamics.\n\n\"There's been some trouble,\" Al continued.\n\n\"I'm sorry Master,\" Markus apologised immediately. Guy nodded, but then his eyes widened in shock. Markus had just called him Master in front of Marek. Guy nudged his gaze towards the man while looking at Al, hoping that he would clarify the faux-pas.\n\n\"It wasn't the kid's fault,\" Marek chimed. \"Our Sect Leader's daughter got the fresh idea of messing with me. Power plays and all that crap. The lad was just caught in the crossfire, not that it disadvantaged him in any way. He can hold his own quite well, kudos for having such a capable and smart Disciple, Sect Leader Larks.\"\n\n\"S-Sect Leader?\" Guy stuttered. 'Okay, A LOT has transpired while I was holed up in the Archives!'\n\n\"I look forward to meeting you soon,\" Marek said to Guy before turning to Al. \"Well friend, I'm disappointed that we could not spend more time catching up. Hopefully, we can do so in the future. I guess the debacle that ensued before puts me in your favour once again. Don't wait too long to cash this one in.\"\n\nWith that said, Marek gave Al a warm hug and disappeared.\n\n\"Teacher Jeeves,\" Guy spoke up. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you everything as we leave. We can't waste any more time here.\"\n\nAl carried Guy with one hand and Markus with the other and flew out. He didn't take them to the landing bay they arrived at, and simply flew straight out through the translucent formation barrier around the Sect. A few kilometres out, Guy suddenly heard the loud flapping of wings. Craned his neck down and saw Garrud stationed suspiciously underneath them. Right then, he knew what was about to happen and screamed at Al to not do it. However, it was already too late. The moment his lips parted, Al's grip loosened, and the Master and Disciple hurtled down. Thankfully, they landed perfectly on top of Garrud, but the impact rattled their groins. If not for them suddenly empowering that region with their mana, the two would have lost all reproductive capabilities right then and there.\n\nAs Guy nursed his aching tenders, Al's voice resounded in his mind.\n\n'The Sect Leader's daughter, Cleo Loras, got the bright idea of humiliating Marek by defeating the student of the man who defeated him,' Al started.\n\nSince he was flying within the radius of Guy's mana sense, the latter responded, 'That's a bit convoluted. And unnecessary.'\n\n'Losing face through association,' Al rephrased. 'The world of mages is very volatile. In fact, I am guilty of admitting that if we hadn't met, and Markus was really my student and he lost to Cleo, her ploy would have worked. But nowadays I'm a bit more... enlightened I guess?'\n\n'How did you get caught in this? You aren't one to actively seek conflict,' Guy asked Markus.\n\n'She lured and trapped me. It came out of the blue, Master. I wasn't prepared,' Markus answered.\n\n'Did you win?'\n\n'I did not,' Markus answered. Although, Guy could hear a pleasant intonation in the answer.\n\n'The boy won,' Al denied immediately. 'If I hadn't stopped him, he would have crippled, or even killed, the girl completely. Don't be mad, he wasn't fully in control of the situation. The girl brought it upon herself by activating a formation that clouded the opponent's rationality.'\n\n'Good job,' Guy congratulated. 'Tell me everything. I want to know.'\n\nMarkus's face bloomed with a childish smile as he started to recollect the duel from memory. His animated tone and evocative recounting reflected the sheer joy the boy was feeling. Because although, on paper, the duel was declared a loss. Markus saw, first-hand, just how much stronger he had become. Guy was also pleasantly surprised by Markus' report. Although he was averse to combat, he recognised its necessity given the path he was planning to take. To that end, one thing that worried him the most was his and his students' abilities to contend against opponents of similar strength. Markus' victory calmed his tumultuous heart.\n\n'Although I don't want to discourage you,' Al spoke up as Markus finished his piece. 'Your overwhelming victory today was primarily because Cleo wasn't knowledgeable about your combat style, and she was also overly arrogant when entering into the fight. When facing a calmer and focused opponent, your chances of victory may be slimmer than you think.'\n\n'I am aware of that,' Markus answered sincerely. 'I lacked proper combat experience while my opponent did not. However, I held the initiative throughout the duel. This could only mean that my opponent entered the duel with a lax state of mind.'\n\nAl hummed in affirmation. He was satisfied that the duel hadn't inflated Markus' ego. After all, it was the number one killer of mages all over the world.\n\n'By the way, Teacher Jeeves,' Guy followed up. 'What happened between you and Elder Glista?'\n\nAl smiled and said, 'We cleared up some misunderstandings and resolved our differences.'\n\nAl left it at that and flew ahead all the while sporting a bright smile. He would love to elaborate, but it wasn't his secret to tell.\n\n____\n\nBack at the Sect, a girl had just woken up from her unconscious coma. Her pock-marked, bruised and burnt skin had returned to its pristine jade-like consistency, and her clothes had been replaced with new ones that once again augmented her angelic beauty. Her broken bones had healed and so had her ruptured internal organs. Everything had returned to normal, except for two things.\n\nThe first of the two was her mind. Losing is a part of growing up. Unfortunately, it wasn't something Cleo had experienced in her life. Every confrontation she entered was measured. She never took action until victory was guaranteed. She was strong, but a lot of her power hinged upon her position as the Sect Leader's daughter, and her intellect in choosing her battles.\n\nYears of continuous victory had clouded her judgement and boosted her arrogance. She thought that because Markus was in the same cultivation realm as her, and because he had no martial combat experience, he would lose under her blade. However, reality proved otherwise. Inside the seemingly non-confrontational human lay dormant a beast capable of unleashing an unbelievable amount of damage.\n\nShe did not anticipate that Markus would have an inexhaustible supply of mana inside him - the barrage of spells exiting his wand was unending and unrelenting. She did not expect that Markus would have a battle instinct rivalling a seasoned master - he avoided every single attack of hers with minimal movement and with precise calculation as if he knew everything she was throwing his way. She didn't know that the boy had an Abyssal Wyrm's blood coursing through his veins - the voracious ball of death that nearly consumed her was sufficient evidence, and the Sect Leader's daughter had enough knowledge drilled into her to distinguish character traits of special mages.\n\nUltimately, she did win. But only through a technicality, and that irked her. She should have lost. But the boy gifted her the victory. How dare he do that!\n\nCleo sat up in her bed and was immediately attacked by a vile stench. This was the second thing that failed to return to normal after the fight.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Alchemy Pavilion was draining their year's stockpile of alchemical waste, and it was disposed of through the drainage systems. The Pavilion Head stopped over and inspected the Young Miss' condition and said that regretfully, the unpleasant odour will persist for at least another week,\" Korr's flat voice answered.\n\nCleo turned around and noticed the emotionless man standing by her bed.\n\n\"You!\" She bellowed while pointing at him. \"You told me that he was weak!\"\n\n\"This slave did no such thing,\" Korr shook his head. \"This slave simply offered his evaluation of the boy. The Young Miss' made the final decision.\"\n\n\"You dare talk back to me?!\" She picked up a ceramic bowl next to her bed and threw it at the man's face with a rageful scream. Contrary to her expectations, Korr raised his hand and caught the bowl before it hit his forehead.\n\n\"You-\" Cleo choked. Korr stood up to her, this could only mean one thing.\n\n\"The Sect Leader has called this slave back to serve him,\" Korr said. \"Thus, I bid the Young Miss farewell.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Cleo called out frantically as she got to her feet. She didn't bother to put on her footwear and grasped at the man. \"I made a small mistake. Just give me a second chance.\"\n\n\"The Sect Leader said to convey to the Young Miss that, 'If you make a risky play, do so when you know you will win. Because of your idiocy, I now have to bend even lower in front of Marek.'\" \n\nIn fact, through association, the Sect Leader had also lost a lot of face due to his daughter's humiliating victory. He had planned to retaliate by scheming to undermine Teacher Jeeves and that boy Markus. However, right after the incident, Elder Glista came with full force and rallied support asking to condemn the Sect Leader for offending guests visiting the Sect. They then went on to challenge the Sect Leader's capacity in leading a Sect if he couldn't control his own flesh and blood. Elder Glista also threw out a plethora of accumulated evidence of the Sect Leader's scruples from the past. Since Elder Glista was one of the pillars of the Sect, these allegations couldn't be swept under the rug and had to be brought to debate and discussion. The Sect Leader had little time to counter the allegations since it literally blindsided him. He would have been the one to dole out Cleo's punishment today if not for the bind he was currently in, in holding the other elders at bay.\n\nKorr paused and said, \"The Young Miss knows full well that the Sect Leader abhors that phrase - 'second chance'. The Young Miss received an opportunity, regretfully she squandered it immediately after. For now, the Young Miss has been ordered to remain within her quarters.\"\n\nThose words essentially meant that she was grounded until her father released her punishment. After bestowing the punishment, Korr exited her compound. Cleo tried to follow him out, pleading and begging. However, she was stopped by an invisible barrier surrounding her compound. The formation to sequester her had been activated. She was caged.\n\n\"It was all that boy's fault. Why was he hiding his strength-\"\n\nCleo screamed out one excuse after another. The fault of the ritual formations. The fault of her weak blade that cracked under the attack of simple water. The fault of the sun for bearing down on her.\n\nHer enraged and wronged shouts echoed within the barrier around her compound, failing to exit it due to the noise-cancellation effects layered in the formation.\n\nShe declared that she would have her revenge one day. One day, she would once again challenge Markus Reva. Crush him. And make him beg for her forgiveness for humiliating her.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-184]]","n":0.021}}},{"i":34,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 182 - Outplayed, Outdone, Outclassed","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nMarek and Al rushed towards the combat amphitheatre in the Outer Division hastily. Marek was embarrassed and outraged at the effrontery of the Sect Leader's contemptuous \"little princess\". He was also extremely apologetic towards Al and his guests, as the Sect's internal matters had bled over and affected them as well.\n\n'If anything happens to my guests, Korr, let the Sect Leader know that the price will be paid in blood. I will inflict the same hurt upon his precious little girl that she causes on the boy,' Marek warned Korr through Mana Transmission. The man did not flinch at the sudden threat and maintained his facade of concern and exhaustion.\n\nAl was also worried. He knew that Markus had little experience in actual combat, and he also knew that his public loss against Gaige weighed heavily on him. Al was aware that sometimes, such experiences could turn into shadows that haunted a mage's heart turning into inner demons. He feared that another such public loss would worsen Markus' complex.\n\nWithin seconds, they had arrived at the stadium, but even before they got there, their mana sense had painted an awkward scene which caused them to slow their approach incrementally.\n\nTheir initial estimates and expectations were wholly shattered.\n\n\"What in the world?\" Marek muttered as he observed Markus shower his opponent with a highly pressurised assault of sewage water which threatened to destroy the highly coveted Azurium Blade in his opponent's hands. Although the metal was known to be relatively brittle, it couldn't be so easily damaged. Which could only mean that the water jet had an extraordinary level of lethality.\n\nOnce Markus ceased the pressurised jet attack, his opponent, who looked nothing like Cleo Loras given her dishevelled appearance and soiled and torn rags, was propelled outwards unceremoniously and came to a sliding halt a short distance away from the stage's borders.\n\nSince Korr was the last to arrive, his internal snigger was shattered in its nascency and his usually unmoving face revealed a crack of surprise and horror. This wasn't what was planned. For a moment, he was even convinced that the other person on stage was probably not the Young Mistress. However, a scan around the amphitheatre confirmed that it WAS her!\n\n\"Elder Glista,\" Korr acted immediately. His mind ran the scenarios and he realised that the sequence hadn't changed. Elder Glista still had to lower the formation, albeit it was more important than ever now!\n\n\"No, no,\" Marek said with a light chuckle. \"I'm interested in seeing how this goes.\"\n\n\"But Elder-\"\n\n\"She was the one who wanted it activated, aren't I right?\" Marek jabbed. \"Actions have consequences. She's been skirting around those consequences for a while now. I believe this will be a valuable experience for the little princess.\"\n\n\"Elder, please,\" Korr begged with sweat dripping down his forehead. It was real this time, not an act, and Marek was enjoying every minute of it.\n\n\"Something's wrong,\" Al interjected. \"Markus isn't usually this aggressive.\"\n\n\"That's because that little miscreant went ahead and activated the Irrationality Formation in her favour,\" Marek answered.\n\n\"Elder!\" Korr immediately called out, only to receive a forceful glare and a suppressed growl from Marek. The reason for his reminder was because technically, the Irrationality Formation hidden in the bundle was a cheat. The formation tilted the duels in favour of one side, which was against the fairness expected from a duel in the first place. If others heard of this, it would dent the Sect's reputation greatly.\n\nAt that instant, Marek and everyone else felt a fluctuation around them. The mana in the region undulated and started to collapse rapidly. For others, it was a momentary lapse. However, for those with more advanced cultivations like Marek, Al and Korr, the effect was wholly amplified. They were more sensitive to, as the other Guy would put it, the \"truths\" of the world even if they themselves didn't know it in its entirety. And the feeling they were experiencing right now harkened back to one of the more fundamental truths that prevailed - spacetime and gravity. In truth, Markus' expertise in spacetime was rudimentary at best. The spell he was conjuring on the field was a hodge-podge of surface knowledge he had gleaned through trial-and-error. However, it was much rawer than anything, anyone else had achieved in this world.\n\n\"Hahahahaha!\" Marek bellowed heartily. \"This boy's got vigour. I like him!\"\n\n\"Marek we need to stop him,\" Al interjected with a stern and anxious expression on his face. \"My goodness, he's improved it!\"\n\n\"What are you so worried about? This spell? It doesn't seem that bad,\" Marek waved away.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" Al scratched his forehead before remembering something. \"Do you remember the Abyssal Wyrm of the Narue region?\"\n\n\"That old hag?\" Marek grumbled with disgust in his eyes. It was clear through that insult that Marek held no positive emotion towards that woman.\n\nAl ignored the incorrect description of the otherworldly beauty in her human form and said, \"Do you remember her ultimate attack? |Eye of the Abyss|?\"\n\nMarek shivered as he recollected that unpleasant confrontation. He hated to admit it but that \"old hag\", as he put it, was someone he had suffered a heavy defeat against. He barely made it out of there alive, partly due to his stupidity in confronting her recklessly and without backup. But in the middle of his unpleasant retrospection, his mind jolted in place. Suddenly, two images started to convalesce in his mind, one from his past and one that was occurring right in front of him.\n\n\"H-How?\" Marek's jaw dropped in shock. \"Is he- No, I mean- Abyssal Wyrm bloodline?\"\n\n'No time to explain. Just know that what he is about to cast right now has the potential to be equally devastating as the |Eye of the Abyss| albeit at a much, much smaller scale. But the problem is that his attack will be pure, with no flashiness. Just unadulterated and voracious annihilation!'\n\nMarek jolted, and without wasting a second longer he got to work dissipating the formation. With a wave of his hand, the Life-and-Death Formation was deactivated. With his position as an Elder, he had the authority to do so. However, the Irrationality Formation was not within his control. It could only be controlled by those expressly allowed by the Sect Leader. In this case, the girl who was in the process of ceasing to exist had the key. However, she was barely in any condition to do so.\n\nHence, Marek deferred to Al, since he acknowledged the man's prowess with anything intellectual in nature. Al didn't need to see or hear Marek's go-ahead as he immediately got to work. The ritual formation in question was subtle, in that it was bundled amidst a series of other formations concentrated on the field. For any other mage, it would have been a chore that would take a few hours to decipher. However, the convoluted bundle unravelled like a loosely tied knot in Al's mind. He could immediately pinpoint the weakness of the formation and attacked it with distributed |Magic Missles| that were modified to transfer a disrupting mana pulse to their targets in a specific order.\n\nDestroying formations was an intricate task. If it was interrupted incorrectly while in operation, the backlash would be immense for the disruptor. To interrupt them, a mage needs to disrupt ritual anchors, which are tangible objects designated as tethers for a ritual based on the ritual's diagram. The diagram may fade over time, but as long as the ritual remains active, the anchors can propagate its effect till the ritual is turned off. Al had witnessed an Irrationality Formation before, and even if it was entangled with others and one anchor was used to sustain multiple formations simultaneously, he was experienced enough to disrupt the formation without affecting others in its bundle.\n\nRight as the last missile hit one of the strategic anchors of the formation, a single foreign word escaped from Markus' lips. The name pierced through the inhuman shriek emanating from the void-black ball in front of him, which was flanked by revolving debris.\n\n|Singularity|\n\n____\n\nIt was like a fuse tripped in Markus' mind. A bunch of voices convincing him to do something suddenly just stopped speaking. His mental faculties defogged immediately, and he was confronted by his most recent and most powerful creation.\n\nThe |Singularity|.\n\nA rather grand name, he admitted, for a piddly recreation of the black hole from his vision. But the question remained, why was it out here? And why was he casting it?\n\nThen, like a ton of bricks crashing into him from a dangerous height, his memories gained clarity and he remembered everything that led up to this moment. He also understood that somehow, he was not in control of his actions for a while. Or maybe he was. Maybe... it was his subconscious that was controlling him?\n\n'What am I thinking?!' Markus reprimanded himself as he observed the |Singularity| falter in front of him. His momentary lapse of concentration would have cost him dearly if it collapsed right now. But that was the only way to dissipate this attack!\n\n'Markus!' Al's voice resounded in Markus' mind. 'The person you are fighting is the Sect Leader's daughter.'\n\nMarkus's eyes widened in shock. Now, he was definitely screwed. Forget about lying low and under the radar, he had just debased and was about to kill the VVIP of this Sect! Markus shot Al a desperate gaze which conveyed everything Al needed to know.\n\n\"He can't stop the attack without hurting himself and everyone around him,\" Al concluded.\n\nHe then immediately rushed on stage and activated a multitude of protective spells, as well as a spell he was working on - using Guy's method of course - to counter that dastardly compressive spell that rerouted a river back at the village. Al dialled the spell up to its maximum possible level and thrust it against the |Singularity|.\n\nEvidently, the defensive spell was not enough. His thought process during its conception did not account for the interweaving of spacetime elements, so the spell could only counter the compressive aspects by overloading it with a lot of mana. As more and more of Al's mana got sucked into the |Singularity| the spell's voraciousness was satiated. Al got a little concerned as more mana than he expected rushed in. It wasn't much in the grand scheme of things, but for a perfectionist who preferred to be efficient with his mana, this discrepancy irked him slightly. He would explore this at a later date.\n\nThen, as anticipated, he cast a much thicker ward spell around the dissipated spell for the upcoming blast. The attack collided against the wall of mana and burst through a few preliminary layers before shutting off.\n\nAs the dust settled, Marek walked over and said, \"Due to external interference, the match goes in favour of Cleo Loras. Congratulations.\"\n\nIt took some time for Markus to register the outcome, but he joined the dots and recognised what Al and Marek were cooking. He then bowed at the shivering girl bathed in filth and said sincerely, \"I have lost. Thank you for broadening my horizons, Mage Loras.\"\n\nHe then quickly jumped off the stage and sprinted away without a moment of hesitance.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-183]]\n","n":0.023}}},{"i":35,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 181 - Heart-to-Heart","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nMarek's feet twitched due to the stress building up inside him. It had been a long time since he poured his heart out like this. His previous experience, many years ago, had wounded him greatly and he was anxious to see how it would go this time.\n\nHe alternated his gaze between the table and Al's face. His conversation partner appeared distracted while gazing blankly into the wall. This simply worsened the turmoil in Marek's heart.\n\n'Give me a reaction,' Marek pleaded. 'Anything at all!'\n\nAt that instant, Al suddenly raised his palm, brought it over his face, and started to shudder as a burst of mirthful, muffled laughter resonated from him.\n\n'That's...' Disappointing. Marek's heart ached once again. He wanted to dig a hundred feet-deep hole and bury himself in it. He wanted the world to end right now so that the past conversation would cease to exist. He wanted anything, absolutely anything, to save him from the humiliation he was feeling right now.\n\n\"I really can be stupid sometimes,\" Al commented. \"The answer was right in front of me - it was literally squashed up against my nose - but I was too absorbed in my paranoia to grasp it.\"\n\n\"W-What-\"\n\n\"I am flattered that you think of me that way,\" Al continued. \"Honestly, I really am. But I am not looking to pursue a romantic relationship at the moment. As you so correctly pointed out, I am going through something. Let's call it a disaster of my own creation. And I hope to resolve that first before moving on to other ventures.\"\n\nBased on Al's answer, Marek could see a faint glimmer of hope. \"If that's the case, maybe I can help? After all, two heads ARE better than one.\"\n\n\"While I appreciate your offer, I won't accept it. I once included someone in pursuit of solving this problem, only to bring peril upon them. I cannot in good conscience inflict the same pain on another person,\" Al denied immediately.\n\nMarek smiled bitterly, before sighing in relief. \"Thank you for that, Al. I really mean it.\"\n\n\"Thank you? For what?\"\n\n\"For your kind rejection,\" Marek answered. \"I didn't know it, but there was a heavy load weighing down on my heart this entire time. 'Should I tell Al? How would he take it?' Those kinds of questions were eating away at me from the inside. Now that I've brought it out into the open, and received closure, I feel lighter all of a sudden.\"\n\n\"Why should you feel so apprehensive?\" Al challenged. \"Is it about the stigma?\"\n\n\"Obviously! Like I said before when I was still a budding mage, I grew attracted to a fellow Sect member. He was a kind-hearted lad who wouldn't think twice before helping others. Although he didn't make much headway in his cultivation, he was always willing to guide and trade pointers,\" Marek started with a nostalgic glaze in his eyes.\n\n\"Over time, my affection for him kept growing and growing. It reached a point where I couldn't contain it within myself. And so, I took a leap of fate and confessed. I thought he was... like me. The nature of our interactions made it appear as such. But he-\" Marek flinched as he recollected the moment. \"He put me out to dry. Let's say his rejection wasn't as dignified as yours. Ultimately, he let it slip and then everybody in the Sect knew - of the deviant named Marek Glista. I realised then that this world had no place for people such as myself. Thankfully I wasn't weakhearted. I could bear the jeers and deriding comments. I worked my ass that day forth. And now, none who looked down on me remain alive. They either succumbed to the tests of time or my blades.\"\n\n\"What of that boy who betrayed your trust?\"\n\n\"He killed himself,\" Marek answered flatly. \"While it may sound morbid, his death was what helped me get over that whole debacle. When I found out that he killed himself, I realised that I wasn't the only one who held affection for the other in our friendship. He too reciprocated my feelings, but he was in denial of his own identity the entire time. He feared validating his feelings for me. It gave me comfort to know that I wasn't alone, but I was also a little dismayed that he chose that path.\"\n\nMarek paused once he finished the anecdote and said, \"But I am surprised that you aren't offended or repulsed by my expression of affection towards you.\"\n\n\"Why should I be offended, more importantly, why should you feel anxious about it either way?\" Al retorted. \"You are in a position where you dictate the rules! To hell with what other people think, they're all hypocrites.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to make me feel better?\" Marek smiled.\n\n\"You think your love for another man is unnatural and abnormal? What of all the people who wouldn't think twice before laying with other species? Is that not unnatural?\" Al reasoned. \"Your affection is pure. You didn't force yourself on anyone nor did you pressure anyone, you were considerate the entire time.\"\n\n\"The way you rejected me earlier, I get the feeling that you've been in a relationship with another man before?\" Marek probed.\n\nAl nodded, \"Of course! You should know that my cultivation urges me to try and learn new things. I have experimented with a man. It was pleasant, I won't deny it.\"\n\n\"I am envious of the man who you shared that experience with,\" Marek said with a wry and dismayed expression.\n\n\"Don't be so dramatic. It was just physical,\" Al shot back. \"I know that you're looking for something more substantial.\"\n\nThe ambience in the room turned brighter at this point as both sides lowered their guards against each other.\n\n\"Since we're being truthful here,\" Al followed up. \"That kid isn't my Student, and that man isn't my Apprentice.\"\n\n\"Are you talking about your companions?\"\n\n\"Yes. The kid's actually the man's Disciple,\" Al confessed.\n\n\"Really? This is the first time for me - seeing a Master and Disciple both in the same cultivation realm. Did the guy con the kid into entering his discipleship?\" Marek asked incredulously.\n\n\"No. But their circumstances are... special. I won't expound on it as it isn't my place to do so,\" Al clarified. \"But I urge you to observe them more carefully, and not dismiss them so readily. Who knows, maybe you'll see something interesting?\"\n\n\"I still don't get why they need to peruse the Sect's archives,\" Marek pointed out.\n\n\"It didn't HAVE to be the Cloudstrider Sect. We would have made do with any other, but this was convenient given the favour. And it worked to our benefit due to the Sect's rich history,\" Al answered.\n\n\"Let me guess, you're thinking of starting your own sect?\" Marek guessed. \"That's not possible though, you are already associated with the co-operative of Teachers... So it's that man then?\"\n\n\"Astute deduction,\" Al lauded.\n\n\"It's going to be difficult,\" Marek responded while shaking his head. \"The scene is quite saturated. Just last year, the Solar Sect Alliance welcomed 250 new registered Sects of which only two remain functional, that too as subsidiaries of the Poison Rain Sect down south.\"\n\n\"I don't think that's going to be an issue,\" Al assured.\n\n\"Why?\" But Marek immediately followed by exclaiming, \"Don't tell me! Given how calm you are, it must mean that it's basically a done deal - a guaranteed success. That can only mean that the man has a strong backer.\"\n\n\"I have no comments,\" Al responded with a blank expression.\n\n\"Your silence speaks volumes,\" Marek chuckled excitedly. \"So who is it? Anyone, we know? Can't be, all of our acquaintances are deeply affiliated with one group or another. Must be someone from outside! Is it a foreigner?\"\n\n\"I was promised an NQA, what's with all these questions?\" Al complained with an exaggeratedly scandalized tone.\n\n\"*tsk* You're no fun! That's okay, I'll have to cross paths with them anyways. I'll be the one representing the Cloudstrider Sect in the next Alliance gathering. The Sect Leader is growing increasingly worried,\" Marek grumbled while scratching his forehead. \"It ain't my fault that he can't birth a capable heir! Honestly, the years of stagnancy have caused malicious rot to set in.\"\n\n\"Can't you do something about it?\" Al suggested.\n\n\"Why should I? The idiot that I am, I made a Soul Contract with the Sect when I got this position. I was too young and hot-headed back then. So long as this Sect exists I will be forever tethered to it,\" Marek blurted out. \"The sooner that I'm free, the sooner I can go about doing something productive with my life.\"\n\n\"Shh!\" Al cautioned. \"What if the Sect's Ancestor hears?\"\n\n\"Do you think that fossil's still alive?\" Marek scoffed. \"It's been years since he entered seclusion in pursuit of an inspiration. My guess is that the bloke failed and Ascended. It's all smoke and mirrors I tell ya!\"\n\n\"I don't understand why you decided to tie yourself with a Sect. Life is so much freer when studying in an Academy,\" Al lamented on Marek's behalf.\n\n\"That's because your family was loaded, isn't that right?\" Marek sneered. \"I wasn't so lucky. And my 'talent' towards cultivation required a lot of arduous unearthing to manifest. It wouldn't have been tractable if I joined an Academy. See, each side has its advantages and disadvantages, Al.\"\n\nAt that moment, Marek and Al both cocked their heads toward the entrance to the room with a frown on their faces. Within seconds of them turning, a series of knocks resounded from the door.\n\n\"Elder Glista! Elder Glista!\" A man's concerned voice called out as a blonde-haired, bearded figure burst in.\n\n\"I'm entertaining a guest, Korr,\" Marek warned sternly, his mana pushing forcefully against the hyperventilating man. This was enough to let Marek know that an act was underway - why else would a Core Formation realm expert breathe so heavily? \n\n\"You better have a good reason for this interruption if you wish to leave with both your eyes intact. And know this, after I remove your eyes if I ever see them healed and functioning I will gauge them out again right then and there.\"\n\nWithout flinching, or hesitating, the man named Korr spoke up, \"Young Mistress Loras and Elder Glista's guest are duelling! A verbal spat devolved out of control into a physical confrontation which then turned into a life-or-death duel, which unintentionally triggered the Life-and-Death Formation. This slave implores the Elder to intervene!\"\n\n\"Those are lies,\" Al denied flatly. \"Markus would never willingly participate in any such duels.\"\n\n\"And yet, the formation is active,\" Marek muttered with a concerned frown as his senses detected the formation in use within the Outer Division. \"The girl has grown impudent. Her father's idiotic doting has spoiled her to her core.\"\n\nWithout wasting a second, Marek gestured at Al and disappeared from his room. Once the two experts had gone, the exhausted Korr immediately dusted himself and wore an impassive expression once again. He then followed the duo as well.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-182]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":36,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 180 - Ulterior Motives","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nIn another place high up in the Sect's floating mountain, in a room inside a courtyard dwelling assigned only for Elders in the Sect, two individuals were in a tense meeting.\n\nAs a sect grew larger, it became harder to manage the individual members and maintain proper control over the organisation. To tackle this issue, regiments were created within the sect led by Elders. An Elder in charge of a regiment would report directly to the Sect Leader and based on the regiment's performance as a whole and their contribution to the Sect, they would have greater say in sect matters.\n\nFrequently, certain competitions would be held in the Outer Division, with Elders in the audience, and based on the members' performances they would be recruited into a particular regiment and move into the Inner Division.\n\nMarek Glista was responsible for the Martial Peak regiment within the Cloudstrider Sect. It was one of the least populated regiments with the most stringent entry requirements, however, it held the highest votes in Sect matters due to the amount of money it raked in through escort and subjugation missions. However, although his regiment was the most valuable within the Sect, his abode did not flaunt that abundance. Every room within the house was decorated plainly, with a preference for function over form. In fact, a large portion of the dwelling was dedicated to a practising field, weapon and spell testing areas, time-dilation chambers, martial arts and cultivation manual storage, and so on. The only room where one could entertain guests also doubled as a weapons storage and display room.\n\nMarek blew lightly over the surface of the hot tea in his hands before taking a small sip. Although he could very well gulp down the scalding cup, given his superior physique, tea was more to enjoy, appreciate and converse over than to satiate one's thirst. Although, the last part of that triad was missing from the present company. He was currently in his personal quarters entertaining a guest who simply refused to partake in any tête-à-tête.\n\n\"Come on now, Al. Stop staring at me as if you want to eat me,\" Marek joked. \"You're making me blush.\"\n\nAl snorted back before picking up his own cup of tea, \"I don't understand why someone such as yourself would collect such precious tea. You don't even know how to appreciate them.\"\n\n\"Maybe it was in anticipation of a guest that was knowledgeable about it. Why don't you tell me about what we're drinking?\"\n\n\"You bought it, you tell me!\" Al retorted.\n\n\"This isn't how you keep a conversation going, Al. There needs to be some back and forth.\"\n\n\"What makes you think I want to converse with you?\"\n\nMarek sighed and said, \"Why are you being so antagonistic with me when all I've done here is cater to you?\"\n\n\"You know exactly why I'm like this,\" Al shot back.\n\nMarek exhaled in defeat and leaned back into his chair casually while adorning an emotionless gaze. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"You know what? Screw it!\" Al bellowed in exasperation. \"That day! You let me win.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Marek repeated.\n\n\"Don't give me that bullshit,\" Al derided sarcastically. \"I don't believe I am so capable as to defeat someone who has earned the alias 'Battle Maniac' in one-on-one combat.\"\n\n\"Aren't you underestimating yourself?\" Marek pointed out.\n\n\"I don't do that. The only reason I agreed to a duel back then was that you cornered me into that confrontation. No one knows me better than myself, and I knew from the beginning that I could not beat you. Your track record made that extremely clear. 'If you want to defeat Marek Glista, bring a mage a realm above or forget about winning,' that's what everyone says do you know that?\"\n\n\"That's highly paranoid of you,\" Marek chuckled. \"Maybe all that studying has fried your brain.\"\n\nAl brought down his fist forcefully on the table before him, releasing a loud boom. Surprisingly the table withheld the attack, nothing placed on it even vibrated. But this wasn't of Al's concern. The moment of aggression was enough to bring Marek out of his jovial mood. He looked into Al's eyes with a cold frown and said, \"Why do you even care? For argument's sake, let's say that I did let you win there. The way I see it, you had everything to gain. How did I benefit from that?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Al chimed in. \"What did you gain from this? Why would you let me win, and give me a freebie 'No Questions Asked' Favour? We all know the saying, 'When something's too good to be true, it probably is!'\"\n\nAs he finished his piece, Al gazed expectantly at Marek. He wasn't planning to leave before clarifying everything. Thus, a stillness settled in the room as both individuals stared at each other.\n\n\"You're a smart man, Al. You must have a theory,\" Marek started, breaking the silence while taking a sip of his tea. But then, he noticed that the tea had cooled down by a lot. So he raised the cup all the way and chugged it down without a thought.\n\n\"Our duel was a simple challenge. You said that it would be a straightforward spar to trade pointers. I believed you and we began a private match. However, midway through our fight, you started to throw wild attacks that were flashy and destructive and attracted a large crowd. Then, you declared loudly that the winner of the match would owe the other a favour, no questions asked.\"\n\nAl paused to gauge Marek's reaction, and continued, \"The turning point midway through our fight, that's the key! Something affected you at that point, and you changed your approach. You could have easily beat me at that point as well, but you didn't. You started to experiment with your attacks and used unorthodox strategies. Although you made it convincing to the observers, I could feel it. You weren't being challenged at all.\"\n\nThe moment Al said the last sentence, he saw a sparkle in Marek's eyes.\n\n\"By letting me win, and tethering me with the favour, you made it so that we could meet each other again in the future. But why?\"\n\nAl posed the question out loud, and immediately followed up with a barrage of questions, \"Was it to fight me again? Did you want to experiment more? Was it to amuse yourself?\"\n\nNoticing Al's heated and accusatory gaze, Marek tried to keep his calm. However, he could not do so and succumbed with a defeated slump of his shoulders.\n\n\"Sometimes, being too smart is a sin. Did you know that?\" Marek said with a bitter smile. \"It is true, I could have won that day. You aren't a combatant at heart, but you held your own longer than others had even with that handicap. You used spells in a way I could never even dream of. You compressed a |Fireball| to a marble-size and applied an illusory trick to make it look like a rock, and then hid it within a |Rock Slide| attack which caught me completely off-guard. That is just to name one instance, throughout the whole fight, I was forced to think on my feet. Nothing went the way it was supposed to. But your weakness became evident when my sword met your own. You are a jack-of-all-trades, master of many, but not in the field I myself lived my entire life for. Weapon-based combat is the very essence of my being. If I had pushed all of my mana and applied a power attack, you would have succumbed and lost.\"\n\n\"My Master would always tell me that you can learn more about a person through an hour worth of sparring than through years worth of conversations,\" Marek redirected. \"In our fight, I believe I got to know that kind of person you are. Resourceful, intelligent, diligent, but deep down, you were vulnerable. Every action you took faltered by a fraction of a millisecond. You were unsure if what you were doing was right, it was the kind of hesitance that came from self-loathing.\"\n\n\"It-\" Marek's voice broke and he paused. With visible difficulty on his face, he continued, \"I empathised with you. I could connect with that emotion you projected: self-loathing and doubt. It's something I've had to live with for most of my life. I didn't know why you felt those emotions. What burned you so deeply that you question your every step?\"\n\n\"Though our combat, I found myself resonating with another. Not in my cultivation, not in my soul, but in my heart.\" \n\nMarek pulled the edge of his lips into his cheeks and said. \"I felt that way many times before when I was younger and still stupid. I followed it once, only to get burned and shamed in public. Since then, I cut that part of my heart and let it decay, never to resurface again. However, when fighting you, that dried up husk that remained in my heart started to bloom once more.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it came back in full force. I could not quell it. During our fight, I had this sudden urge to be selfish and let everything be damned. But I knew that it wasn't right - it wouldn't be fair for you. Yet I had to do something to quench that part of my heart.\"\n\nWith a passion-filled gaze, Marek said, \"When you know you can't have it. But your heart just won't stop searching for it. All you can hope for is that the mere sight of it is enough to satisfy that fervour.\"\n\n\"I did have an ulterior motive when I let you win,\" Marek said finally with a worried tone. \"I just wanted to see you again. I knew that as long as this favour hung over your head, we would meet again. Well, I hoped that we would. Luckily, it came to pass.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-181]]\n","n":0.025}}},{"i":37,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 179 - Insurmountable Wall","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nEven amidst the dense fog lingering over the field, Markus' sight was as clear as though it were any regular day. Nothing was occluded from his spacetime vision. Cleo thought she had finally pulled the wool over his eyes, seeing as her technique worked every single time it was put into use. She was also confident that with his regular senses clipped within his mana domain, Markus wouldn't be able to predict her location or actions.\n\nHowever, every attack she threw Markus' way was dodged without the slightest falter. Even some of the faster slashes would miss him by a hair's breadth as though he had predicted its trajectory. What she didn't know was that without the distractions from his regular sensors, every single attack was telegraphed in his perception.\n\n\"STOP DODGING!\" A rage-filled bellow echoed within the blanket of fog.\n\n\"TAKE IT LIKE A MAN, DAMN IT!\"\n\n\"What does my masculinity have-\" Markus side-stepped to avoid an overhead slash, \"-anything to do with your inability-\" he ducked to barely miss a frontal slash, \"-to land an attack on me?\"\n\nCleo was thoroughly miffed. She didn't miss the fact that Markus was essentially dodging with his eyes closed. She had no idea what magic he was using to sense her attacks!\n\n\"I can do this all day,\" Markus sighed. Then suddenly, he jerked his head sideways and looked directly into the fog. Even though his sight was occluded by the mist, his pupils were focussed on a single point. He raised his wand and flicked both his hands towards the direction he was facing. \"But I don't feel like wasting time...\"\n\nThe ground started to rumble once again. Cleo expected the ground to wave again like before, but within this mist, no spell could shake her... above ground.\n\nThe ground shattered with a hole as a torrent of water gushed out in her direction. It all happened within a split second, leaving Cleo only enough time to bring her blade forward to block the attack.\n\nThe reason Markus was stalling for time earlier was that although he couldn't manipulate the mana above ground, he was afforded free reign under. In his predicament, Markus was left with two options. He could either tap into his mana and transmute it to fuel his attacks, or he could search for alternate sources. Even if he had barely dented his mana reserves, Markus preferred to go with the latter method since he found that his opponent had less influence over his actions the less he depended on mana to bridge the gaps in his spells.\n\nFor instance, if he started transmuting his mana to burn fuel to propel |Fireball| or other fire-based spells, Cleo would know of this in advance and she could intercept his spell by tampering with the ambient mana (which was fully within her control at the moment). So, Markus extended his senses underground in search of any \"fuels\" for his attacks. He knew that his ground attacks from before wouldn't be effective in this situation since he could not follow up with another attack given his restricted mana domain. After a few minutes of fruitless searching, Markus stumbled upon the Sect's sewage system flowing right beneath the combat field.\n\nThe sewage system was overflowing with water, amongst other things. Furthermore, the region was not under Cleo's control since she didn't deign to restrict him there. Maybe it was her oversight wrought by arrogance or ignorance, nonetheless, it was enough to turn the table to Markus' advantage.\n\nBack in the orphanage, Markus had once seen his Master utilise a bucket of water to clean and properly carve out the near decrepit steps. His Master used a spell that pressurised the water and released it with a destructive spray that literally cut through the stone. He then used a low powered version of the spell to remove the gunk, fungus and moss coating the surface that would cause the surface to turn slippery during rainfall. Markus was floored by the power of a mundane and commonplace item such as water.\n\n\"A river can carve through mountains if given enough time. I'm just speeding up the process,\" his Master had joked.\n\nA similar but violently more destructive spray collided against Cleo's blade, whose enchantments had all been activated in defence. The mist surrounding him had started to dissipate, as Cleo was forced to turn her full attention to protect herself. She could literally feel the destructive power of the attack!\n\nAs the fog finally descended, Markus turned from using the sewage as the source and started to call in the ambient moisture. With his control over the environment back in place, he could now literally recycle the water being used in the attack.\n\nA barely audible crack formed on the blade, which was known to be able to withstand blows of a Core Formation realm mage. Cleo's eyeballs nearly burst out of their sockets, and her control almost faltered as the small crack started to grow with a webbing pattern.\n\nShe could no longer maintain her defence. If she held any longer, then the blade would shatter. While she could commission a new one, nothing was more disgraceful for a bladesman that having their weapon, which is like an extension of their body, shatter in public. She grit her teeth and dropped the blade, which was also a disgraceful move, and switched to a |Greater Ward|. But the attack was far too concentrated, and her ward also started to display visible cracks.\n\nSHATTER!\n\nLike glass breaking, Cleo's final defence fell through and she was attacked by a million knife-like collisions of water particles. Her clothes shredded immediately, and so did the peripheral skin around her abdomen. Then, once again, she was flung backwards like a ragdoll, rolling a few times before falling face-first with a mighty plop.\n\nIf compared to her appearance when she landed on stage, Cleo had been completely defiled. Her demure, lady-like aura had turned to match that of an unclean hag who hadn't washed, bathed, or managed her hygiene for years on end. Her marble-white and smooth face was filled with pockmarks through acidic corrosion and darkened through a mixture of soot deposits, acid charring, and general sewage waste. Her divine clothes had been fully shredded and sullied with the same residues marring her entire body. The only thing keeping her dignity intact was the far superior material composition of her innerwear made of wyvern skin.\n\n\"Y-You!\" She uttered with a hoarse voice while cradling her abdomen with a hunch.\n\n\"Is the match over?\" Markus asked the referee, seeing as the girl had entered a feverish trance.\n\n\"Umm,\" the man turned towards the girl to gauge her reaction. But the girl looked away immediately, with faint fear in her eyes. Her arrogance had dissipated, and now she was regretting her actions. But, there was nothing she could do. She had initiated the Life-and-Death Formation. The match couldn't terminate until only one person remained alive on stage. All she could hope for was the arrival of an elder, any elder, to terminate the formation. She was willing to throw away all of her pride to save her from this embarrassment.\n\n\"In that case,\" Markus sighed. \"I will play one last spell.\"\n\nCleo was winded, she couldn't physically move. She could only look on in fright, as one spell circle after another started to burst out from Markus' hands.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNine.\n\nTen.\n\nCleo's eyes widened as the eleventh spell circle fell into place, with a circumference larger than the others preceding it. One by one each previous circle found its home at the eleventh's periphery. Right as the final circle fell into place, the entire ensemble gained a luminous purple shade and started to spin at an unusually fast velocity.\n\nsssssssssssssssSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII\n\nAn ear-piercing sound burst out from the centre of the rotating circle, as a small dot of nothingness began forming. The vortex started to pull everything around it like a voracious demon. The wind, the water, and even the ground started to levitate and converge at the point, only to stop at a small distance away from it forming some kind of a protective shield. Not that it needed one, Cleo could feel the pure death oozing from the small dot.\n\nShe had never seen anything like this before. She had never felt fear like this before. Maybe it was because her spirit had been thoroughly crushed by the one-sided beating she received earlier, but none of her brothers or even her father could scare her to such an extent.\n\nIt was the fear of the unknown.\n\nCleo's confidence stemmed from the fact that she was always in control. She was the Clan Leader's most doted upon daughter. The golden child. She had all the power in the world, and she knew everything. Well... apparently there was a lapse somewhere, and it was about to cost her... a lot.\n\n____\n\nFor Markus, there was an insurmountable wall before him ever since his defeat at Gaige's hands. No matter what people told him to assuage his depression, he could never get over that hurdle in his mind. However, he tried.\n\nEvery day since his defeat, he pursued ways to win against Gaige. He didn't want to lose anymore. He would formulate a strategy, and immediately pit himself against Gaige to see if he would win. If not, he would try, and try again.\n\nMarkus had formed a benchmark to test his mettle against, and he always sought to beat that benchmark. Yet, to date, he could still not defeat Gaige in combat.\n\nWhat Markus did not realise was that his perception of Gaige's strength grew with his own. In his pursuit of excellence and superiority, somewhere along the way, Markus had left Gaige behind him. \n\nIt was in his character to doubt himself. At every point in his internal simulation, when he was about to trounce Gaige, Markus would subconsciously formulate a scenario where his opponent would find a weakness or lapse and regain the advantage. This defeat would spur Markus to think harder and try alternate strategies, each more brilliant and ingenious than the last.\n\nIn the end, Markus had formed a nearly unbeatable strategy. To leverage the superior efficiency of his spellcasting to pressure the opponent into a corner. After advancing to the Foundation Establishment realm, he could even leverage his intermittent ability to control spacetime to cause his opponents to make missteps. Every combatant runs mental calculations when fighting. But tampering with their internal model of self - that is by changing their weight - their flow would be interrupted allowing Markus to steal the initiative.\n\n'This was too easy,' Markus sighed. 'Gaige could have easily used his bloodline ability to pressure me from the start. I overestimated this girl.'\n\n\"Prepare yourself,\" Markus declared out loud. Then, he uttered the name of the attack he was about to throw her way. Actually, there was no pre-existing name for what it was in Markus' tongue. But his Master had defined a word in another, cryptic language. It wasn't Ancient tongue, nor was it a language from this globe, according to Mage Nara. Nevertheless, the meaning of the word perfectly defined his attack.\n\n\"|Singularity|,\" Markus said as he released the attack. Even through the shrill, banshee-like scream bellowing from the nothing-ball of terror, his voice carrying the name of the monstrosity echoed across the field and into Cleo's ears.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-180]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":38,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 178 - Exchange of Pointers","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nCleo was caught mid-sentence, as a |Fireball| collided against her. It was thanks to the warding enchantments on her attire that most of the damage was mitigated.\n\n\"Thi-\"\n\nBOOM!\n\nCleo's eyes widened in shock. Just as the smoke from the previous attack cleared in front of her, she saw three spell circles, covering one larger circle, spinning rhythmically around Markus' wand-bearing hand. The one at the centre produced another |Fireball| of identical size and propelled it without pause. This time, Cleo was prepared. She immediately activated a |Lesser Ward| and blocked the incoming attack.\n\nRight as the |Fireball| dissipated over the ward, another one rushed towards here. Cleo was dumbfounded. 'Is he trying to end it quickly by overpowering me with spells?'\n\nShe gritted her teeth and blocked the attack once again, only to field another one, then another one, and another one. The barrage of |Fireball| spells was unending and relentless. No matter how she dodged the spell, her path would be intercepted by a |Fireball|.\n\n'I can outlast him, as long as I keep my pressure up within the overlapping domain, he should be expending more mana to propel the |Fireball| spells,' Cleo concluded. Although the attacks hadn't physically hit, it was an exhausting endeavour to dodge, weave and block. What she thought would be a trivial victory had turned into arduous labour.\n\nHowever, her plans wouldn't come to pass. 'His tempo hasn't changed. He isn't exhausted. And I can't feel his influence in my mana domain at all! Why isn't the Fire Mana being agitated with all these |Fireball| spells flying around?'\n\nIf the other Guy were here, he would preach that Markus' spells communicate directly with the Truth of the World. Without the need for elaborate lies, the world does half the work for you. To top it off, Markus was barely tapping into his mana pool to cast these |Fireballs|. By offsetting the cost of combustion with a more efficient fuel called Nitor, he could go on for days. \n\nOver the past year, Markus had updated the resources stored in his hands-free belt satchel, in large part thanks to his Junior Sister's assistance and recommendations. Nitor, for instance, is an alchemical intermediate ingredient created by concentrating the \"burning\" nature of coals. In other words, it's a type of alkane with an extremely high carbon constituency. Naturally, such a hydrocarbon is unstable, however, thanks to a few trivial steps, it is possible to create it in large quantities. In comparison, a small pinch of Nitor powder is equivalent to two hand-sized chunks of coal.\n\n'I can't keep this up, I'm just exhausting myself,' Cleo concluded. 'I need to cover the distance.'\n\nCleo centred herself and allowed a few |Fireball| spells to collide against her enchanted gear. Then, by lowering her frame, she weaved through the successive onslaught and managed to reduce the distance between herself and Markus. Since the start, she had barely managed to move from her initial position. Even if she moved sideways, forwards or backwards, Markus would reposition himself to maintain the separation while pushing her back to the starting point. However, through expert maneuvring, she was now midway.\n\nWith another leap, she was a blade's length away from Markus. He could no longer cast |Fireball| lest he hurt himself. Cleo could metaphorically taste his blood at this point, but then it happened again. She miscalculated her push through an overestimation. She pushed too hard, and instead of landing within her blade's engagement distance, she was an arm's length away. At this position, she could not follow through with the sideward slash that she had prepared. She would have to either strafe backwards or switch to a body attack to push Markus into her engagement distance.\n\nThese calculations occurred within her head within split seconds. However, she knew she had lost her advantage. And Markus capitalised on this. The spell circles on his hand dispersed and new ones took their place. The change was near-instantaneous, well beyond the level of most mages in this cultivation realm. Furthermore, although she was at this close distance, she could still not make heads or tails of the simple yet functional designs within. Markus pushed his empty hand against Cleo's left chest and jabbed the wand under her chin. From the hand that contacted her chest, bloomed another spell circle.\n\nThen, all of Markus' hair rose towards the sky, and sparks started to burst from them. Within Cleo's mana domain, she perceived a change. It was rapid and pervasive. In an instant, a sharp smell assaulted her senses, which was immediately followed by a rush of lightning flowing through her. It was an intense shock that undulated within her, spasming her muscles and organs. She lost control of her body in intermittent bursts. It was humiliating, not just the lack of control, but the fact that this interloper just laid his hands on her!\n\n____\n\nWhat Cleo didn't know was that the hand placed over her left breast may have saved her life. Markus was actively rerouting the flow of current through her nerves away from the heart. Good thing too, because he had vastly underestimated the concentration of ions in the atmosphere at such an altitude. His early trials back at the orphanage, it was much milder. He could only imagine the utter misery Cleo was going through as her neural network was overloaded causing all of her voluntary and involuntary muscles to go haywire. The constant surge to her brain should have also interrupted her thoughts.\n\n'Hopefully, she won't die...'\n\nThen again, someone would interfere if things got to that point. Markus had learned from his mistakes in the past. He could not show any mercy in a moderated duel. The last time he did that, he lost miserably.\n\nWith that in mind, Markus ramped up his attack and activated another set of spell circles, using the phial of sulphur in his satchel as the source. A mist of sulphuric acid formed around him, drenching the electrocuted girl. The distributed nature of the attack overwhelmed her attire's warding enchantments, and began eating into her clothes, hair, and skin, turning them a dirty yellow shade. In the beginning, her clothes started to regenerate, with the help of the enchantments within. But after a few more distributed acid attacks, the regeneration could no longer keep up and ceased working altogether.\n\n'This should be enough, right?' After a casual ten minutes, Markus pondered whether to stop the shock attack. He hadn't tried it on another human yet, so he didn't know if this was enough to incapacitate her. Furthermore, her appearance had also deteriorated drastically after her unceremonious acid bath. It kind of hurt Markus' conscience to watch her suffer like that.\n\nThus, Markus stopped the |Acid Mist| spell and targeted the makeshift black powder in his satchel. He activated a short burst of anti-gravity to reduce Cleo's weight and shoved her forward, causing a disconnect in the flow of current. Then, with a quick cast of |Explosion| he propelled her further.\n\nCleo flew through the air and landed like a ragdoll at the far end of the stage.\n\n\"Umm... Do I win?\" Markus asked the dumbfounded referee. The man, in turn, gulped and looked at the wrecked body of the girl. He was given instructions to not stop the match even if anyone surrenders. So, after dabbing his sweating forehead, he said, \"The combatant isn't incapacitated. The match will continue!\"\n\n\"FUCK!\" A hoarse voice bellowed. Cleo coughed audibly as she stumbled to stand up. She turned to face Markus, with deathly rage bursting out of her eyes. The fact that her appearance had tattered to match a jaundiced person with large porous burn scars and disintegrating clothes simply amplified her murderous aura further. The last surge of electricity prior to her propulsion had caused her hairs to mat up and protrude outwards, adding a maddened garnish to her aesthetic.\n\n\"YOU-\" The girl waved a trembling finger towards Markus as she prepared to spit out a series of insults. However, she was immediately interrupted by a mouthful of |Fireball|. The barrage was relentless. Cleo hurriedly activated one of the enchantments on her blade, causing it to shine a bright cyan. She then sliced through the incoming |Fireball| causing it to split midways.\n\n\"AAAARGGGHH!\" She shouted as she continued to slice through the |Fireball| spells. As she gained proper footing, Markus raised his right foot and activated a spell circle at his sole. He brought it down, eliciting a hollow booming noise that vibrated throughout the stage.\n\nWithout stopping the fire attacks, Markus continued to rhythmically raise and lower his foot. With each drop, the booming noise rang louder and louder, until suddenly Cleo could physically observe the ground wave as though it were made of water.\n\nWith another drop, the wave gained a massive boost in amplitude, causing her to be pushed off the ground. Now off-balance, Markus ceased the fire barrage and started to accumulate a |Great Fireball| on his open hand with his wand pointing at it. The swirling ball grew larger by the second before Markus immediately released it towards the hovering Cleo.\n\n\"ENOUGH!\" Cleo screamed as she swung her one-handed blade with both her hands grasping the hilt. With a mightly slice, the |Great Fireball| was dissipated. However, Markus anticipated it and followed the attack with an |Explosion| which hit her right in the face while she was recovering from the exhausting defensive manoeuvre.\n\nCleo staggered as she tried to stop herself from collapsing. Markus could see her chest rising and falling, as she tried to catch her breath.\n\n\"Is the match over?\" Markus inquired, seeing as the girl explicitly called 'enough'.\n\n\"HOW DARE YOU! I WILL KILL-\" The girl once again began monologuing, however, Markus reverted to his strategy and tossed a |Fireball| her way.\n\n\"Oh no, you don't!\" The girl quickly strafed right and spun in a pirouette with her blade extended outwards, like a deadly top. From the tips of her blade, a white mist sprayed out. All around Markus, the water particles suspended in the air started to condense and washed his vision a translucent white shade. A heavy fog descended upon the stage.\n\n\"I've let this go on for long enough,\" the girl's voice echoed around Markus. His senses were completely overloaded. As he tried to extend his mana sense, he realised that the girl was actively enforcing her influence over their overlapping domain making it hard for him to do anything. He could not manipulate the mana around him at all.\n\n\"Within this fog, nothing comes in, nothing goes out. You are at my mercy,\" the girl said ominously. \"Even if you call for a surrender, no one will hear you.\"\n\nMarkus was in a complete bind. At that instant, his only active sense suddenly warned him of an impending attack. He leaned back immediately, only to miss a sweeping slice an inch away from where his neck would have been.\n\n'She's intending to kill me?' Markus thought. That attack was laced with an intent to decapitate. All this while, he had only been holding himself back. It appeared as though it was all for nought since the girl had intended to thoroughly disable him from the very beginning.\n\nMarkus' rogue thoughts narrowed to a single conclusion, 'I must end her.'\n\nWith a renewed focus, Markus once again extended his bogged down mana sense and turned off all of his regular human senses, tuning into a frequency that the girl had no control over.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-179]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":39,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 177 - Bait, Funnel, and Trap","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n\"It's Cleo Loras!\"\n\n\"That's her?

Markus's mind blared at him earnestly.\n\n\"And with that, the Outer Division Ranking Tournament comes to a close,\" the girl spoke with a pleasant, sing-song voice. The crowd around Markus turned silent and everyone assumed their seats.\n\n'Shit! I can't leave now or else I will stand out.' Markus too sat down in his spot. His instincts were telling him to brace for the worst.\n\n\"The results will be deliberated by the panel of judges and the rankings will be posted soon. Before we end today's event, I would like to offer an opportunity to those present here today. I am opening the floor up to a challenge, anyone here can challenge me to a duel right now. If you are in a lower cultivation realm, I will suppress myself to match you. As an ante, I will put up this-\"\n\nThe girl waved her hand and a few attendants brought in a mound of ore.\n\n\"- Red Moloch ore. For those that do not know of it, Red Moloch is a highly malleable and silky metal often used for protective apparel worn by spellcasters. It is highly resilient to extreme temperatures, and is capable of dissipating most physical attacks.\"\n\nThe crowd started to murmur and commented on the rarity of the ore. Based on the conversation, it appeared to be an extremely scarce mana metal, found only within the volcanic abode of an ancient Phoenix that resided on an isolated island in the Toroid Ocean to the East.\n\n\"How generous,\" Markus muttered involuntarily.\n\n\"Indeed! Miss Loras is the kindest person in the Sect,\" a fawning teen affirmed.\n\n'Too generous,' Markus repeated. This was a disconcerting sign. When things appeared to be too convenient, coincidental, or generous, there was always something morbid brewing behind the scenes. Someone was up to something. Markus did not believe the praises showered by the surrounding men one bit. 'The girl has an agenda, and I don't want to get involved in it!'\n\n\"The duel will follow standard rules of engagement,\" the girl continued. \"So, who's interested.\"\n\nAs expected, no one was willing to step up. No matter how tempting the reward may be, even the most hormonally charged boys in the crowd could smell a scheme from a mile away. It was just too good to be true. In addition to that, no one wanted to cross weapons with the daughter of the Sect Leader, no matter how kind and amicable they were.\n\n\"Well, that's awkward,\" the girl shrugged. \"Since no one here is willing to give me face, even after I've brought out such an amazing reward, I guess I will have to step up myself. Let's see who the lucky one will be.\"\n\nSilence prevailed in the audience for an uncomfortably long time as the girl waved a finger around the crowd randomly with her eyes closed. At that instant, the roaming hand narrowed and latched on to Markus' hunched figure.\n\n\"You over there! Yes, I shall fight you!\"\n\n'Fuck!'\n\nMarkus immediately edged behind the person in front of him to break the line of sight between the girl and himself.\n\n'She was after me all along! But why? Does this have anything to do with what Teacher Jeeves warned us about?'\n\nUnfortunately, the teen in front of Markus had the same idea, and moved out of the way, revealing Markus' cowering figure.\n\n\"I don't think I have seen you here before,\" the girl commented with a confused expression. \"Nonetheless, you shall be my opponent.\"\n\nMarkus stood up awkwardly and said, \"Hello. I am Markus Reva. I am simply a guest to the Sect. I don't think it is fair to the Sect members for me to participate in this duel, especially given the rarity of the reward.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you Markus! It is only unfair if you win, are you so sure that I will lose?\" The girl said while smiling coquettishly.\n\n\"I apologise if my words were offensive, that was not intentional,\" Markus responded while bowing lightly.\n\n\"Well, there's nothing to it. Come on up!\"\n\n\"I would like to decline,\" Markus answered.\n\nThe girl frowned and said, \"Unfortunately, that is no longer possible. You see, in the Cloudstrider Sect there is a rule that if a challenger calls out to someone for a duel, they must accept.\"\n\nMarkus looked around and saw a plethora of confused expressions plastered across the audience members' faces. He knew immediately that this was a bogus rule made up to trap him into accepting the fight. So without a second thought, Markus answered, \"In that case, I shall accept and forfeit.\"\n\n\"The duel does not start until the challenged alights the stage and the match is officially started,\" The girl retorted.\n\nMarkus grit his teeth and tried to escape, however, the instant he tried to take a step backwards, something stopped him from physically doing so. It was like an invisible string holding him in place. So, Markus was left with no other option than to move forward. With each step taken, the string holding him shortened as well, disallowing any form of escape.\n\nHe trudged unwillingly, with heavy steps, towards the vast platform at the base of the amphitheatre. The world around him had turned silent, or maybe it was just his perception. His heart started to palpitate at a fever pace. His memory of his greatest loss on a similarly public stage started to resurface in his mind.\n\n'The match will begin, and I will surrender,' Markus repeated to himself. 'I cannot fall for her trap.'\n\nMarkus approached the steps leading up to the stage and exhaled to calm himself. 'I will surrender. There is no need to fight.'\n\nYet, the moment his feet touched the first steps, a change transpired in his psyche unbeknownst to him, 'Why must I surrender?'\n\nHe took another step, 'Wasn't losing once to that guy enough? Must I put myself down again?'\n\nWith the final step, he was on the platform, 'I will win. I must win. Because I can WIN!'\n\nMarkus' calm gaze was immediately washed over with a burning passion.\n\nThe girl smirked internally as she saw the change transpire before her eyes. The boy who was wearing a stoic and impassive expression of a mature mage warped to match the fiery arrogance of those hotheaded youths. Her play had succeeded! Before descending on stage, Cleo had commanded Korr to initiate the Life-and-Death Formation that tethers a challenger on stage with a challenge within the confines of the amphitheatre. The tether only works if the two are within the same cultivation realm, and makes it so that the challenged is left with no exit apart from entering the stage and waiting for the match to begin. The second formation was one less known amongst the Sect members, and that was the Irrationality Formation.\n\nA rather peculiar ritual formation that subtly affects the target's mind to lower their sense of preservation and rationality, and causes them to err to the side of imprudence. It doesn't completely turn a target into an instinct and rage-fuelled animal, but it moves those suppressed instincts to the forefront. As evident here, Markus was the target of this formation, without his consent. This was Cleo's ace in the hole. She had an inkling that the boy would turn tail at the first sight of confrontation.\n\nIronically, if Markus had simply taken the bait earlier, the formation wouldn't have been activated and he could have easily surrendered a few seconds into the fight. However, because of his hesitance, he was now caught in a net.\n\nMarkus stood at the starting location at his end of the stage, and Cleo assumed her position as well.\n\n\"Draw your weapons,\" the referee declared.\n\nCleo drew out a think one-handed, curved blade which had a sharp and blunt edge. The metal was a translucent cyan colour, with a hilt with golden base and leader handle bindings, and a pommel with three gems embedded in it. Cleo twirled the blade in one hand and held it behind her, with a seemingly lowered guard.\n\nMarkus in turn retrieved his wand hanging to his side and unlatched his Grimoire, which floated open to his side.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to use a wooden weapon?\" Cleo taunted with an innocent pout. \"You don't have to go easy on me, big brother!\"\n\n\"We are the same age, Miss Loras, you can call me by my name. And do not worry, I won't go easy on you,\" Markus answered. He cringed internally the moment she used the term 'big brother'. Unlike when Dora called him that, Cleo's tone oozed with subtle toxicity. It was extremely unpleasant to the ears.\n\n'It is as Korr predicted - a spellcaster. It looks quite... small, but it definitely has the appearance of a magical staff. Although, the gem is at the base, unlike a regular staff where it's at the tip. Regardless, it shouldn't cause me much trouble, since it's only an unattuned gem. The spell that it can cast must be a plain type. The floating book does not appear to have any offensive functionality, but I cannot discount it just yet,' Cleo thought internally. 'What am I worrying about? This duel will be finished before it even starts! I just need to elongate it enough till Elder Glista gets here. Let's hope this one lasts that long.'\n\n'Although she doesn't use the sword like Gaige, I should be able to adapt to her attack patterns. Unlike him, I predict her speciality should be in speed-based combat. After analysing the pattern of the many previous combatants, it seems that the cultivation in this Sect leans towards either hard-initiation decapitation attacks or hit-and-run attrition attacks. Her stance appears relaxed, which means that she is either confident in her chance of victory, or she has no combat sense. I doubt the latter to be true, seeing as she lured me into this duel. Regardless, I cannot take any chances.'\n\nThe referee raised the flag.\n\n'Satisfy me, Markus!' Cleo thought to herself, as a savage smile bloomed on her face.\n\n'I will win!' Markus repeated as he tried to contain his aggression.\n\n\"BEGIN!\"\n\nCleo initiated the first stance in the Translucent-Mist Blade Technique, |Dispersion Step Strike|. She would essentially disperse from her current position, turning into mist, while appearing behind her enemy for a serene strike. This was how the attack would appear to the public, when in fact it was a derivative of the |Flash Step|, a basic weapon combat technique that requires the user to saturate their lower body muscles with mana in short and powerful bursts. The difference between that and the |Dispersion Step Strike| was that this method integrated it into the illusory overtones of the |Cryptic Cloud| cultivation technique.\n\nIf successful, she would inflict high damage on Markus from the get-go, immediately placing him in a disadvantageous position. Cleo was confident this attack would succeed. Her muscles twitched in preparation. But right as her feet were about to leave the ground, her step faltered. It wasn't due to fear or a mistake. Cleo had no idea how it even happened. It was as though she had underestimated her own weight. That should be impossible - how can she make such a mistake? After many hours of practice drilling the motion into her muscles, the mistake should not have happened!\n\n\"Wha-\"\n\nBOOM!\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-178]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":40,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 176 - Defense","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\"Is that the best you've got?!\"\n\n\"Not by a long shot! Try defending this!\"\n\nMarkus observed the fight on stage with an unwavering gaze. The two combatants collided once again, one sword against another, causing a small shockwave to spread out. Both of them appeared to be on the verge of collapse, one with a fractured arm and another with multiple shattered ribs, both of which could easily be fixed with a small sip of a regenerative potion.\n\nIn his time as a mage, Markus had only ever participated in a handful of combat scenarios. Of those cases, only one truly pushed him to apply his strengths to their fullest and that was against Gaige. So, it wasn't a stretch to admit that Markus was inexperienced in combat, and this conclusion did not sit well with him. Even though his Master emphasised the art of dialogue in resolving conflicts, what of Markus' goals in walking the mage's path? What guarantee was there that every conflict could be solved by a civilised discussion? At the end of the day, when spells start flying and weapons start swinging, even the most well-crafted of words cannot stop heads from rolling. \n\n'I don't think martial arts are the way to go, though,' Markus wondered. Although back in the Academy, he was put through a basic course of martial arts and combat training, it wasn't anything special that resonated with him. It was a generic set of combat arts, which wasn't even thoroughly explained. His cohort was provided with an instruction manual and was assigned a set time period during each day to practice the sequences defined in it. There would be an instructor only in name, as they never intervened in any way. One must know that the starting cohort in most Academies, like in sects, was sizeable and there were a lot of heads to go around. The expectation during these early stages was to filter out the weaker \"investments\". During the martial training sessions, peers would compete against each other through spars, some in good faith and others with malicious intentions. Markus was unfortunately subjected to the latter since his proficiency wasn't in combat and was thus generally slower in grasping the movements.\n\nGaige had his own unique martial art that meshed with his cultivation. Markus wasn't disappointed or envious of that because his path did not require him to hold a cold weapon or propel his arms and legs against his opponents. His weapon was the humble forearm-length piece of wood that his Master had crafted for him, and his mind.\n\nHis Master would often jokingly say that \"a mage must always be prepared.\"\n\nNo matter the situation, a mage MUST have a solution handy. An unprepared mage is a dead mage. It was due to this mantra that Markus perpetually carried a handsfree belt-satchel, and the Grimoire crafted by Teacher Jeeves on his person. In the satchel, he would store phials and containers of useful resources that could aid him during spellcasting or allow him to escape. The Grimoire contained all the information he would ever need.\n\nWith this said, why was Markus so engrossed in the fight? Markus' primary goal here wasn't to learn to fight from the combatants, but to formulate possible countermeasures should he have to confront the two in the future. Markus' mind constantly ran simulations that pitted himself against the opponents and recreated every move, spell and attack. If he couldn't determine a countermeasure within the time the attack took to hit him, he would note it down mentally so that he could address it at a later time.\n\nThe combatant with the fractured hand leapt back to separate himself and immediately spun around while slashing his sword. As he did so, the metal started to glow a dangerous turquoise shade and a wave of wind swept forward. The other combatant wasn't prepared for that - he expected his opponent to continue an exchange of sword attacks at close range. The separation agitated his rib injury, causing a momentary lapse in concentration. The gush of sharp air hit him on his shattered ribs, tearing his already tattered clothes and shoving him backwards forcefully. With a pain-filled scream, the teen rolled off the stage and collapsed unconscious.\n\nWhile a few attendants immediately rushed towards the injured combatants and administered first-aid, Markus pondered over the last attack. It may look simple on the surface, but he could see that the wind blade that was projected forward was a highly complex spell when observed at a closer level. The complexity came from the fact that there were multiple minor wind blades formed by small eddies within the projected gust which added shredding action to the attack WITHOUT breaking up the gust as a whole.\n\nThe question was, could he have defended against that attack? The answer was yes, he could have defended that attack because it originated from a mage in the Mana Condensation realm. The amount of mana behind the attack was low, and the mage's mana domain was abysmal. Markus could easily overpower that gust before it even left the sword. However, Markus took the inquiry to the next level by amplifying the attack to match that of a Foundation Establishment realm mage. Could he have defended against one like that?\n\nThere are many ways to protect and defend oneself against attacks, both physical and magical. However, we can categorise these methods into two large buckets: Passive and Active defence. Passive defence involves the use of enchanted gears, defensive rituals, innate bloodline and physique advantages, and so on. These are protective measures that persist in the background and do not require the mage to divert their attention in maintaining it. Active defence involves the use of physical or magical defence measures that the mage must consciously maintain for it to remain effective.\n\nWhen it comes to defending with magic, the answer can fall somewhere between two ends of a spectrum. You can have a sweeping defence that covers all bases, or you can have a specialised defence that is perfect for the attack you intend to block. The easiest way to define the two is by using physical defence mechanisms as a basis for comparison. Two warriors with a sword and shield each enter combat. The first warrior swings their sword with a sidewards slash. The attack is telegraphed and the defender is faced with two options, they could either raise their shield to block the attack or they could use their own sword to parry the attack and follow it up with a shield bash to gain the advantage.\n\nImmediately, the difference is evident. The shield block is a sweeping defence. Although it is effective, it is wasteful. The blocker has to take the shock from the attack, and they do not gain any advantage from the defensive manoeuvre as the initiative is still in the attacker's hands. However, there is a higher guarantee of success. On the other hand, a party is more efficient, but sacrifices the guarantee and is also heavily reliant on the blocker's skill. Yet, upon a successful parry, the initiative is turned over to the defender.\n\nA mage has a blocking spell in their arsenal known as |Ward|. There are variations of the spell such as |Lesser Ward|, |Greater Ward|, |Ward Wall|, and so on that build upon the spell. Essentially, the mage puts up a multi-layered mana shield to physically block the attacks. Sometimes, the shield can be infused with special elemental capabilities to counter specific elemental attacks - |Hydrous Ward| for fire-based attacks and so on|. The greater the proficiency with the spell, the greater the number of layers and the stronger the defence. It was simple and fit the purpose. However, the downside here was that a |Ward| spell consumed mana when active, and was proportional to the damage it sustained. Furthermore, just like shield-blocking, it is extremely difficult for the defender to gain the initiative in combat through this method.\n\nMoving towards the other end of the spectrum, the defensive maneuvres get increasingly more intricate and specialised while becoming more efficient in their mana usage and in their capacity to gain the initiative. Take the |Fireball| as an example: a simple |Lesser Ward| can effectively handle the attack. However, a more specialised solution would be to create a vacuum region along the path of the projectile to dissipate the ball of burning gas. Moving further, it is also possible to manipulate the surrounding air to redirect the attack to another trajectory. At the furthest end of the spectrum, one can create a piercing gust of wind that rotates counter to the |Fireball| which uses the energy of the attack to ignite itself, essentially turning the incoming |Fireball| into an outgoing |Flame Lance|. As evident, the amount of mana and resource required to initiate the defence maneuvres decreases while the skill requirement increases.\n\nThe goal of a skilful mage is to find the perfect balance in the spectrum. Even if one manoeuvre is highly efficient, it requires the application of a lot of mental processing power. Is the investment sensible in the long run? Sometimes, a less efficient defensive manoeuvre is preferable if it can protect against multiple attack patterns.\n\nThese were the kinds of questions Markus was cycling through in his mind at that moment. This exercise was a practice to hone his instincts and make him a superior mage.\n\nThe reason why martial arts were created was that there is an upper limit to the base instincts of humans. A beast in the same cultivation realm as a human is a lot stronger because their instincts are superior. To bridge this gap, humans created martial arts to artificially hone their innate instincts and train their bodies to react to specific scenarios.\n\nFor a mage that uses their mind for combat, the procedure to hone their instincts involves constant mental conditioning through reasoning and debate. The goal is to train the mind to arrive at the correct conclusion in a highly stressful scenario, just like breathing and blinking.\n\nRight as Markus devised an optimal defence against the wind attack, the stage was cleared. Then, from the viewing stand embedded into the mountainside, a figure leapt out and descended. The figure glided through the air gracefully, like a leaf floating in the wind, and landed casually on the stage.\n\nMarkus' eyes glanced at the figure's face and widened in horror.\n\nThe reaction was an instinct ingrained into his soul. The girl's expression, her aura and bearing, and her classical beauty, all of these features combined caused multiple alarms to blare in his mind.\n\n'I have to leave!' Without hesitation, Markus lowered his head and started to scoot out from his spot. Unfortunately, his exit was blocked by the agitated youths around him.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-177]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":41,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 175 - Power Struggles","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Pathetic!\"\n\nIn the stands embedded in the cliff-side at the back of the auditorium, within one of the more elaborate covered viewing boxes, a girl barely into her mid-teens, spat out in disgust at the \"embarrassing\" display below her. Her piercing blue eyes were languid as they scanned over the two individuals confronting each other on stage. She shifted a strand of her void-black hair draped over her eyes and on her marble-like smooth skin, behind her ear.\n\n\"Why am I here again?\" She exclaimed. \"There are so many other vermin beneath me who can handle this!\"\n\n\"The Sect Leader asked for the Young Miss specifically,\" a deep male voice answered. From the shadows, an immaculately dressed man who appeared to be in his mid-twenties stepped forth. He sported a perfectly trimmed blonde beard and moustache that connected with his golden-blonde hair. His square face was a shade paler than everyone else around him, and his hazel eyes betrayed his foreign heritage.\n\n\"What have I done that's gotten father so angry?\" She snorted. \"If this is his way to punish me for a mistake I've made, tell him that I am not impressed. How can I correct myself if I don't even know what I've done wrong?\"\n\n\"This isn't punishment,\" the man answered with a flat tone. This entire time, his face had remained perfectly stoic. If not for the frequent yet imperceptible oscillations of his chest, one could easily confuse him for a statue.\n\n\"Then?\"\n\nThe man remained silent and shared a meaningful gaze with the younger woman. Her eyes narrowed in response while her mind whirred into motion in an attempt to interpret the meaning behind the man's cryptic stare. After a short minute, she exhaled loudly in annoyance and complained, \"Fuck it! I don't care. I'm leaving!\"\n\n\"Young Miss...\" the man pleaded without a waver in his voice.\n\n\"Tell me, or I'm leaving.\"\n\n\"The victors need to be awarded,\" the man reasoned.\n\nThe girl clicked her tongue and shot back, \"Not my problem.\"\n\nThe man positioned himself in front of the retreating girl, blocking her path.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to do this?\" The girl threatened with a sneer. \"You forget, Korr, that your life is not yours anymore.\"\n\nThe man did not falter. \"While this slave's life is tethered to the Young Miss', his allegiance is to the Sect Leader first.\"\n\n\"It will be your word against mine, Korr,\" the girl said with a fake pout. She then proceeded to tear her dress from the collar while whimpering, \"What would father do if he found out that his most loyal servant defiled his only daughter?\" Her hands jerked wildly, revealing a set of immature lumps fixed in place with a turn of sturdy cotton. \"Maybe he won't believe me, because I know he trusts you more than any of his own flesh and blood. BUT, do you think he will remain still after this news becomes public? To him, is your life worth more than his face?\"\n\nThe man stared listlessly at the girl attempting to put on a solo-act, without moving a muscle.\n\nThe girl looked pointedly at the statue of a man for a charged minute, before lowering her hands casually. As she did so, her torn clothes started to regenerate at a visible pace, immediately covering her up. \"You're no fun. Now stop wasting my time and tell me why I'm here?\"\n\n\"The victors need to be awarded,\" the man repeated while nudging an overlooked stack of papers on the table next to the girl. Her eyes followed suit and perused through its contents. Midway through, her mouth widened into a knowing smile, before settling at a confused frown.\n\n\"He wants me to build up my own force of loyalists? Why?\" The girl inquired. \"Does he want me to compete with my elder brothers?\"\n\nThe man nodded.\n\n\"What use is dipping into the Outer Division for this? Shouldn't I be corralling support from the Inner Division?\"\n\n\"The Young Miss must already know that the First and Second Young masters have already cornered all the impactful members from the Inner and Core Divisions.\"\n\n\"Then what's the point?\" The girl sighed.\n\nThe man paused and gazed into the distance. \"When prey is cornered, that is when it is the most dangerous. With a well-placed bite at the jugular, even a rabbit can kill a distracted lion.\"\n\n\"Are you comparing me to a bunny?\" The girl chuckled.\n\n\"This slave asks the Young Miss to evaluate the proposition,\" Korr emphasised.\n\n\"I know, I know. Elder brothers have become complacent. Their play at succession has become a childish tug of war. The Sect has become stale. The Elders bicker amongst each other, the Inner and Core Divisions are filled with wastrels and yes-men. Father wants me to add fuel to the fire by shaking up the balance in the upper divisions and raising prospective supporters brimming with the fire of ambition. That's why he is willing to give me access to all of these weapons, potions and manuals as a reward for this tournament,\" the girl said while pointing at the stack of papers.\n\n\"But the fact remains, why me and why now?\" She added. \"I've been actively staying out of this power struggle for a reason. Why would I voluntarily jump into a pool of headaches by becoming the Sect Leader?\"\n\n\"The confidence that Young Miss just displayed is part of the reason,\" Korr replied. \"The Young Miss will be more successful and more capable of raising the Cloudstrider Sect to new heights.\"\n\n\"Are those your words or fathers?\"\n\n\"This slave believes that the answer is irrelevant. What matters more is whether the Young Miss is willing to step on this path? As the Young Miss already stated, success is a foregone conclusion after all.\"\n\nThe girl revealed a savage grin that warped her pure face and said, \"If father really intends to go ahead with this, he must be aware of how I operate. Blood will be spilt. A lot of it.\"\n\n\"What must be done-\" The man stopped mid-sentence and jerked his head towards a specific location in the bleachers. His unperturbed face cracked with a frown and his eyes narrowed.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" The girl inquired.\n\n\"I sense Elder Glista's token in the crowd,\" the man extended his index finger and pointed toward an individual in the crowd. \"That boy.\"\n\n\"Ha! He stands out like a sore thumb in a sea of black,\" the girl snorted. \"How does he blend in so well? No one's even noticed his presence.\"\n\nKorr's frown deepened. \"He's passively manipulating the surrounding mana to block his sound and smell, as well as redirecting the light rays reflecting from him. Apart from that, his aura - or sense of presence - is completely suppressed.\"\n\n\"Passively? Without spellcasting?\" The girl exclaimed in surprise. \"If I remember correctly, that Battle Maniac pushed for two all-access tokens. If one is here, where is the other?\"\n\n\"The second should be in the Archives.\"\n\n\"WHAT?!\" The girl bellowed in anger. \"That old man acts as though the Sect is his - the Archives hold the history and workings of our Sect and he just let a stranger have complete access to it? He dares to ask for not one but two all-access tokens with no reasoning whatsoever. Is this Sect his personal playground?\"\n\n\"Elder Glista is a key pillar of the Sect,\" Korr reminded. \"He doesn't ask for much-\"\n\n\"But when he does, it's something monumental like this! The man needs to be put in his place,\" The girl scratched her chin in thought before continuing. \"Since I will have to stake my claim for the leadership, I must achieve something exemplary to stand-out.\"\n\nHer lips parted with a ruthless grin as she wetted her lips with her tongue. She extended her finger and traced the boy's face in mid-air playfully, \"He shall be the first stepping stone. Tell me about him, Korr!\"\n\nBeing in the Core Formation realm, Korr had little difficulty extending his mana sense to |Inspect| the lad. \"Foundation Establishment realm, Base stage, just like the Young Miss. By my estimate, fourteen to fifteen years old. He should be affiliated with Teacher Jeeves-\"\n\n\"The 'Polymath'? I thought the Battle Maniac and Al Jeeves were bone-deep rivals? He would do a favour like this to the man that defeated him?\" The girl scoffed. \"How is the boy related to Al Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Student or a Disciple. His musculature indicates that he has little to no experience with martial arts.\"\n\n\"So he takes after his Teacher.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, from what I could gather by sensing his cultivation, it isn't something I have experienced before,\" Korr concluded while shaking his head.\n\n\"It matters little,\" the girl dismissed. \"The Deceitful-Mist Bladesmanship is devised to specifically counter spellcasters.\"\n\n\"How does the miss wish to proceed?\"\n\n\"If the boy IS intimate with Teacher Jeeves, he will be smart and not fall for a direct provocation. He needs to be cornered into a confrontation,\" the girl muttered. After a short pause to formulate a plan she turned to Korr and rattled out a series of instructions.\n\n\"This slave shall make it so,\" Korr bowed and turned to leave.\n\n\"Wait!\" the girl commanded. \"Activate the Life-and-Death Formation.\"\n\n\"Young Miss!\" Korr rebutted.\n\n\"Are you worried that I will lose the confrontation?\" The girl challenged.\n\n\"That isn't so. It is unadvisable to mortally wound Elder Glista's guest-\"\n\n\"I know! Don't treat me like an idiot!\" She snapped back. \"The boy will definitely surrender before the match even begins. The Life-and-Death Formation assures the start of the match. After that, I will just have to make my move before he can audibly throw the towel. Once the blows are exchanged, he won't have the sense to extricate himself from the fight.\"\n\n\"But Young Miss, once the Life-and-Death Formation is initiated, it cannot be stopped.\"\n\n\"That is unless someone in an Elder's position interferes,\" the girl hinted mysteriously.\n\n\"This slave understands,\" Korr nodded affirmatively. \"This slave shall make it so.\"\n\nAnd with that said, Korr disappeared in a haze flash. The girl stroked her chin and licked her lips once again as a sense of morbid intoxication washed over her. \"It's been some time since by blade has spilt blood. You poor boy, don't disappoint me.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-176]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":42,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 174 - Exploring the Sect (Part Two)","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nMost of the \"public\" sections of the Sect were constructed outside the mountain, unlike the Archives. Thanks to that, Markus was able to enjoy the magnificent architecture in its entirety. It was the only thing he could do to distract himself from all the unpleasantness around him.\n\nAlthough he had tuned out the bullying and corrupt practices proliferating around him, he just couldn't get himself to immerse into the Sect's culture and ambience. For some reason, he kept feeling a sense of rejection pulsing inside him, urging him to leave immediately. \n\nMaybe it was the claustrophobic environment contrary to the wide-open nature of the Sect's design. The precarious location and general unreachability evoked a sense of imprisonment - a feeling of being trapped. Markus had learned through strategic inquiries that Outer Division members weren't allowed to leave Sect premises unless it was for a mission. The Inner and Core Division members had more leniency, however, they were also tethered to a large degree. Markus could guess that all those people would start feeling like animals trapped inside an isolated cage.\n\nMarkus had once heard of an experiment from his Master. It was about an isolated room, filled with rats who would have every physiological need of theirs catered to. Food, water, a place to sleep, the rats would have everything they could ever want. However, they were never allowed to leave the room. No rat could leave, and no other rat could enter. The experiment persisted for a very long time, over the course of which, the investigators tracked the changes in social dynamics occurring within the cage.\n\nIn the early stages, the rats were content - they flourished. But as time progressed, their indulgence started to falter, as a growing sense of depression started to prevail amongst the populace. A few rats secluded themselves in their personal spaces, avoiding interactions with others. Other rats devolved into their most base and violent instincts. The derangement ramped up very quickly after that point when rats started to attack and kill each other at the slightest provocations. The experiment ended in a bloodbath with only a few rats, who had lost their sanity, left alive.\n\nWhat Markus could feel permeating within the ironically fresh Sect air, was this foreboding sense of violence and depravity.\n\n\"This isn't a place to learn!\" It wasn't conducive at all!\n\nThe few locations where the teaching of some kind took place were at these large congregational buildings known as pavilions. These buildings were multifunctional, in that they operated as both repositories and storage rooms, as well as lecture and practice halls. For example, the Ritual Formation Pavilion was one of the larger buildings in the Sect. It was only a short distance away from the Mission Centre as you descended the mountain.\n\nThe Ritual Formation Pavilion had two architectural forms mated into one seamless structure. There was a towering section which also acted as the entrance and hall, as well as a flat and wide section which acted as the practice area. After a long stretch of despondency, Markus was finally excited to explore an actual house of learning.\n\nHowever, after truly understanding the way the pavilion functioned, Markus was once again served a second scoop of disappointment.\n\nThe pavilion operated by a pay-to-access principle; not everyone could enter and benefit from its many features. If one wanted to access the repositories, storage rooms, or practice halls, they had to submit a certain amount of internal currency known as 'Sect Merits'. The lecture halls were free to access as long as a lecture took place there, which was apparently very infrequent. For reference, the last lecture held there was six years ago. Entry to lecture halls was first-come-first-serve, which was a fancy way of saying those with the most influence and strength would get the seats closest to the front.\n\nReturning to the concept of Sect Merits, the only way to earn these merits was by performing assigned tasks or missions. That's right, although the missions offered a specific payout, the reward was fully appropriated by the Sect and the participants were awarded Sect Merits in return. These merits could then be turned in for certain benefits like accessing these restricted sections in the many Pavilions in the Sect, accessing the Sect's main weapon cache, personal tutoring time with Elders, and so on.\n\nUpon a cursory glance, the Merit system may seem like an exercise to encourage participation and a sense of belonging, however, Markus could see past the flimsy facade and understood its grim reality. Let's say that a certain store sells a myriad of items, most of which aren't available anywhere else. However, instead of accepting standard currency they only accept a special token. It is only possible to earn this token by performing tasks and missions for the store, or by exchanging circulating currency. On paper, it looks like a system to cultivate membership and repeated purchases at the store.\n\nThere is a special sword in this store that costs 1000 merits. Due to its uniqueness, there is no proper basis for comparison, however, we can use its grade to set a baseline. To accumulate these 1000 merits, one may have to take on ten to fifteen missions with the store, or trade 500 gold coins. At this juncture, people would be immediately drawn towards the ten to fifteen mission requirement as it is perceived as more economic. However, if they were to take on comparable missions from another client, they would earn at least two times the 500 gold requirement. Now, let's assume that the store's purchasing requirements are met, is the obtained sword even worth the 500 gold? Is it worth the harrowing missions where your life is on the line?\n\nThis is how the Sect exploits the Merit system. By creating a false economy built on non-functional tender, they take advantage of the members to fill their coffers with actual money. It is all implemented so ingeniously, that the members don't even feel that they are being exploited. Cleaning a pavilion would earn them some Merits. Performing collection tasks warrant Merit. Acting as sparring partners to Inner or Core division members gets you Merits.\n\n\"This is literally slave labour...\" Markus sighed while shaking his head. This realisation soured his enjoyment of the Ritual Formation Pavilion, not that he could get anywhere inside to do it in the first place. Even with the Elder's token, he was barred entrance due to lack of Merits. He faced the same opposition in the other pavilions littered around the Sect. Due to its age and heritage, many pavilions were catering to most of the known specialities in magecraft. Alchemy, enchanting, beast-taming, and even the so-called lesser fields like painting and so on. Although, none could match the grandiosity of the Ritual Formation Pavilion, primarily because it was what the Cloudstrider Sect was known for.\n\nThe only other space where some form of pedagogy occurred within the Sect was in the Martial-Arts Hall. Given that the Sect was just another mercenary corp washed with fancy colours, there had to be someplace where new members were trained and brought up. What reason would there be for the Sect to take in scores of members at once if not to replenish their ranks and raise their strength both individually and as an organisation?\n\nThe Hall was within a walled-off compound. Thankfully, there wasn't a Merit paywall blocking him from exploring the place. After circling the place both outside and within, Markus found out that by design and implementation, it was a lot similar to the training fields back in the Academy. There were places to practice weapon-craft, spellcasting, movement arts, and so on. There were also locations to exercise and meditate, as well as a multi-functional gym with free weights. Finally, just when Markus was getting excited, he collided against the formidable Merit barrier! Beyond a certain floor in the main building attached to the field, there were a series of special training rooms that, apparently, lengthened the perception of time by a substantial factor. Given the Sect's proclivities towards unfathomable ritual formations, Markus was convinced that these rooms were time-dilation chambers that somehow affected the occupants' mental faculties either by dialling it up or actually affecting the fabric of spacetime. After inspecting the region with his spacetime vision, Markus did not observe any discontinuities, but it wasn't enough to sway his earlier hypotheses.\n\n\"Maybe rituals are blocking my view. I can't discount either of them. Then again, it could also be something completely outside of my theories. For that, though, I will need access which will be impossible,\" Markus muttered to himself as he exited the building. Right at that moment, a series of loud cheers, boos and hisses unsettled the eerie silence looming in the area.\n\nCurious, Markus followed the noise around the Martial-Arts Hall and walked up a set of stairs. After circling a wide path around the mountain, Markus arrived at a large amphitheatre built into a much larger excavation in the mountainside. The semi-circular amphitheatre was centred at a wide tournament-regulation stage. At the steep side of the mountain, which was at the back of the amphitheatre, there were a few more viewing platforms up high, probably for the more renowned spectators.\n\nThe amphitheatre itself was filled nearly to the brim with people ranging from Markus' age and above, all of whom were spectating an ongoing match between two combatants. Evidently, the match had been going on for a while since the spectators were feeling a bit antsy, and the combatants were bathed in blood and sweat. Yet neither showed any sign of forfeiting.\n\nThe last time Markus witnessed any regulated fight of this kind was a bit more than a year back, which also happened to be his loss against Gaige.\n\n\"Maybe I can use this chance as an opportunity to improve,\" Markus surmised as he shimmied towards a seat midways from the stage. 'Observing these spars could help me formulate better strategies for myself during future conflicts.'\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-175]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":43,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 173 - Exploring the Sect (Part One)","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\n\"You're short! There are only three phials here, our agreement was for ten,\" a teenage boy dressed in a white robe with indigo and gold clouds embroidered on it chided with a disdainful frown on his face.\n\n\"I'm sorry Senior. The collection has become much harder given the increase in the... demand. I believe there are three more members from the Outer Division reporting to Senior,\" another teenager responded with a painfully deep bow. He was garbed in a black robe with similar embroidery minus the gold inlays. The condition of the fabric was also miles behind that of the other boy's, with frequent scuff marks and hastily patched up tears peppered around them.\n\n\"Are you saying it's my fault?\" the white-robed boy shot back aggressively?\n\n\"N-No-\"\n\nBefore he could respond, the black-robed boy was grabbed by his hair and slammed to the ground. The white-robed boy looked around hastily before dragging the boy by his hair into an occluded alley.\n\n\"I believe I made myself pretty clear the last time,\" the sentence was paused as an audible punch landed on the black-robed boy, in a region below his ribs. \"You donate Body Tempering Potions to me, and I don't hurt you.\"\n\nAnother punch landed in the same location, eliciting a pained groan from the black-robed teen.\n\n\"I wouldn't need to recruit more members from the Outer Division if you had done a better job. Are you satisfied with doing the bare minimum?\" The question was followed by a kick toward the black-robed teen, who was in the fetal position. \"If you want to attract the attention of your superiors, you need to go above and beyond. What I gave you was a test.\"\n\n\"Fucking Outer trash! Get this through your head. This is how cultivation works. It's all about gaining benefits when possible,\" the white-robed teen bellowed maniacally. \"If you want to get ahead, you need to step over a few heads in the process. Do you think every piece of shit entering the Outer Division gets to enter the Inner Division?\"\n\n\"Do you think this is unfair?\" The boy asked sarcastically.\n\n\"N...\" a low mumble was heard. The attacker lowered himself into a squat and raised the beaten boy by his hair once again.\n\n\"That's right! You should be grateful! This Senior is simply teaching a lucky Junior such as yourself. So learn diligently, okay?\" the white-robed exhorted with a snicker oozing with morbid enjoyment. \"This is motivation. Do better!\"\n\nMarkus walked past the alley with his attention consciously averted from the one-sided beatdown occurring within. The white-robed teen continued to pummel down on the nearly unconscious boy on the ground, making sure to avoid the most visible locations. Markus could only shake his head in disappointment at the outcome of a series of events. He was disappointed at the fact that life in a Sect was no different than back in the Academy. In many ways, it was worse here because there was a clear differentiation in the hierarchy between those less capable and those more capable in cultivation.\n\nWhat the black-robed boy was going through, Markus had suffered worse. He had been hurt for the pettiest of reasons, sometimes simply existing and breathing was enough to warrant an assault. One day, Markus simply looked at a girl in his cohort for a second longer than the norm. That also ended up with him getting shoved into the garbage collector. Not because the girl demanded it, but rather a few groups of teens his age, who had failed to attract the attention of the girl, took it upon themselves to punish anyone with \"untoward\" thoughts. No one came to save him that day. Passers-by simply lowered their heads and moved on, just like he was doing now.\n\nSure Markus sympathised with the black-robed boy's plight. But he wasn't in any position to interfere. For one, Markus was pretty sure that the way the black-robed boy collected those three phials of potions was by meting out the same level of hurt to those around him. Secondly, Markus' intervention would be inconsequential. He could stand up and condemn the assaulter, and then what? Markus was sure he was stronger than the assaulter - he could beat him. But the victory would be overshadowed with a gauntlet of confrontations with a Senior above his conquest, then another, then another, until finally, an Elder would descend on him with the fury of a thousand suns for a simple \"sleight\" that had grown out of proportions.\n\nAn intervention was necessary, but not one that started from the trenches like this. If a change had to be made, it needed to come from the top. And in a world that listened only to the strongest, Markus' voice would barely register as a whisper.\n\nThus, to avoid attracting unnecessary conflict towards himself, Markus followed the cardinal rule of avoiding trouble: see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing. He lowered his gaze and actively avoided seeing things directly. With his wider field of view after advancement, Markus simply allowed his mana senses to guide him. Everything he heard around him, entered through one ear and exited out the other. Finally, no matter what the case may be, Markus kept his lips sealed shut like a clam.\n\n\"It's all a learning experience,\" Markus repeated to himself. After all, he was here only to observe, not interfere. His purpose here was to gather information for his Master's sect - as a Disciple, he wasn't here to make things harder for his Master. Everything good should be assimilated, everything undesirable should be recorded and avoided.\n\nTherefore, Markus decided to put the uncomfortably rampant bullying within sect premises at the top of the 'Everything Undesirable' list in his head. Speaking of discomfort, there appeared to be another kind of bullying he hadn't yet experienced in his lifetime... bullying of the sexual kind. Not just men acting... ungentlemanly with women, but also women pushing themselves aggressively against other men all to gain benefits for themselves. Of course, the horned up male teens were unaware of the blatant harassment they were facing, but Markus, as a third party, was extremely disgusted.\n\n\"To use their bodies in such a way...\"\n\nAfter an exceedingly mountainous amount of effort, Markus finally tuned out all the other unpleasant displays around him to focus on more constructive things. His first stop was at a rather prominent building at the centre of the Sect which was labelled as the Mission Centre. He could only enter and peruse the peripheral hall, which held a few sparse escort and extermination missions with a substantial payout. Most of these missions seemed to originate from well-known sources, primarily businesses that had a nationwide and international reach. \n\nBased on Markus' knowledge, a Sect could generate income through two main routes. The first, and most straightforward, is through these sorts of missions. The Sect would perform these mercenary works for contracting parties in return for payment. On the down low, certain sects are also known to take on contracts that walk the grey or black paths such as theft, kidnapping or assassination. Usually, it is the unorthodox sects that proliferate in this market, but sects in the orthodox alliance are also known to dabble in these acts while maintaining plausible deniability.\n\nAlternatively, a Sect could also earn money through its own side businesses. The Cloudstrider Sect is known for its highly potent ritual formations. Third parties can contract the Sect's services to set up formations for defence, offence or general utility. Other sects offer their own speciality as a service or even other tangible resources obtained through mines or resource-generating infrastructures under their control. \n\nMarkus took note of this aspect as he moved past the Mission Centre. Since the location acted as a central node of the entire Sect, moving on the rising path led Markus to the entrance to the Sect's Inner Division.\n\n\"Hold it! Identification,\" One of the armoured guards blocking the path demanded as they moved towards Markus. Markus bowed respectfully in return, causing the guard to lower his aggression slightly, before presenting the token on his person.\n\nThe guard injected his mana into the token before tossing it back. A smug smile flashed across his face for a microsecond, before it returned to a flat frown. He then said, \"Beyond this point is the personal quarters of the Inner Division members.\"\n\nAs he terminated that statement, he walked toward Markus with an imposing aura. His body language clearly implied opposition, while his words did not dictate it.\n\nMarkus bowed once again before turning. As he did so, he noticed another guard approaching the man who turned him away. By gently sharpening his mana senses, Markus caught their conversation.\n\n\"Wasn't that Elder Glista's token? Why did you turn him away?\" The second guard asked.\n\n\"I wanted to test and see what kind of a person caught Elder Glista's attention,\" the first guard snorted in disdain and said, \"Look at how weak he his? He didn't even utter a peep, he just ran away with his tail tucked beneath his legs!\"\n\n\"What if he goes and complains?\" The second guard responded with a worried tone.\n\n\"I never stopped him,\" the first guard retorted innocently. \"The formations will have recorded every word spoken, they can testify that I never denied entry.\"\n\nThe second guard chuckled and said, \"You're walking a tight rope.\"\n\n\"Who cares? As long as I'm in Young Mistress Loras' corner, it won't be so easy to shake me.\"\n\n\"Corruption,\" Markus shook his head in disappointment. This was another problem affecting such organisations. He had witnessed it back in the Academy as well, although it wasn't so blatant and bone-deep as here - where even the guards and peons had some form of \"backing\".\n\nNeedless to say, apart from the Sect's architectural heritage, Markus was thoroughly disappointed by everything he'd witnessed till now.\n\n\"Maybe it was my own fault for keeping such high hopes,\" Markus sighed. \"It's all the same, no matter where you go.\"\n\nWith an audible exhale and a dismayed shrug, Markus resumed his walk in the direction of the Outer Division.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-174]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":44,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 172 - Sects of the Past, Present... and Future?","n":0.316},"1":{"v":"\nThe Cloudstrider Sect started some 5000 years ago - after the Age of Isolation - making it one of the older sects in the scene. To that end, their Archive was chock-full of data crystallising their rich operating history and beyond.\n\nAs Guy added more and more books into the RoK, he entered a fugue state of semi-consciousness. This was a first for him, a usual speed-reading session never took him to such a level of immersion. What he was experiencing at the moment was magical through and through.\n\nImagine completing a book and moving on to the next one. At that point, you would expect to have repressed the information accumulated from the first book to the back of your conscious mind as you focused on the current one. However, for Guy, it was as if everything he read before was overlapping with what he was reading at the moment. The effect kept getting stacked as he moved from one book to another. It could be likened to holding down on the sustain pedal while playing the piano. Guy wasn't sure why or how this was possible, but he could confirm that it wasn't a benefit gained from the RoK or the Church.\n\nThanks to his current state, he could easily stitch together an intricate story as more content was being added to his repository. It was like each book in the Archive held a puzzle piece that could only be extracted by reading it to its entirety. With each piece obtained, a flourishing tapestry came into view.\n\n'So sects are a relatively new concept?' Guy exclaimed. 'Wait... 23000 years? That's not new at all!'\n\nBefore sects came into the picture, hierarchical congregations of unaffiliated warriors, mages, mercenaries and their ilk were called Adventurers' Guild. According to a historical text - if it could be called that given the rampant use of speculative and exaggerated language - during the times of yore when the concepts of magic were still mystical and uncategorised, beings with the gift of magic often joined a union of some kind known as an Adventurers' Guild where they worked by practising their magical trade in the form of quests. Each Adventurers' Guild had a Guild Master who was often elected by members of the guild. They could be elected through a contest of strength or other talents such as management, connections or wealth. An Adventurers' Guild operated within a particular region, which was their de facto region of influence. New guilds could be formed under the umbrella of an existing guild or they could sprout off on their own. However, encroaching into the territories of other guilds generally ended in a conflict called a Guild War, at the culmination of which either the losing guild ceased to exist through total annihilation or assimilation into the winner.\n\nGuy found that these Adventurers' Guilds shared a lot of similarities with the ones he'd read of in a lot of fantasy novels in his past life. Their function and mode of operation were extremely similar. However, Guy noted that there was very little similarity between an Adventurers' Guild and a Sect apart from the fact that they were by definition, a congregation of mages. An Adventurers' Guild had a generally flat hierarchical structure. There was the Guild Master followed by a Vice-Guild Master or an Administrator, and then there were the rest of the members. The hierarchy amongst members was fluid and decided based on strength and fame. In a Sect, there were multiple layers of hierarchy, oftentimes to an exhausting degree. A Guild was not a place for disseminating and teaching magic to others. This was usually performed through Master-Disciple dynamics. However, a Sect was also an institute for learning that cultivated new members. Many such dissimilarities separated the Guilds of yore from the Sects of... yore. So that begged the question, how did these Adventurers' Guilds transform to become Sects?\n\nThe text went further to paint a picture of this transition. Because of the arcane nature of magic, only those with talent, bloodline, physique, or the ability to view the world with a skewed point of view could manifest powers. Those that couldn't manifest magic naturally, could also learn it through a Master-Disiple relationship. The issue, though, was that a Master that learned magic through intuition would find it difficult to explain it to a Disciple. Only those disciples with the intelligence to interpret their \"genius\" Master's nonsense could succeed in this case. \n\nOver time, as the disciples became masters and cultivated disciples of their own, their structured method of magic became more and more refined, reaching a point where a large group of individuals all shared the same form of magic. In this case, it was illogical for this group to affiliate themselves with a loosely structured guild with a hodge-podge of other characters. They found it prudent to create a \"guild\" of their own that could act as a vehicle to train more mages like themselves.\n\nIn some instances, other groups of similarly trained mages decided to form alliances amongst themselves to form a multi-faceted \"guild\". Once these new \"guilds\" entered the scene, they quickly took the old guilds by storm. For one, the appeal of being able to learn and improve WHILE earning swayed people towards these new \"guilds\" who turned to call themselves sects as it was a more fitting name for their collective. During this transformation, a lot of other changes happened alongside. For example, the dichotomy between mages who applied magic externally (outside the body) and warriors who worked their magics internally (inside their body) was erased altogether. Ultimately, magic was magic no matter how mana was being used.\n\n'It's not a wholly unbiased recounting, but it is sufficient. Besides, knowing the history of sects, in general, does little to aid my cause.' Guy concluded. 'I get what the guilds' purpose was in the past. They acted as protection against magical threats. But what function do Sects have nowadays?'\n\nThrough further reading, Guy found out that a sect's purpose was also to offer protection against magical threats in its region, but with the government and clans catching up martially they had become somewhat redundant. The Cloudstrider Sect rarely initiated large-scale operations to eradicate hordes of dangerous magical beasts, or congregations of mages from an unorthodox magic practising sect.\n\nOn a side note, sects operating within specific regions often congregated to form an alliance. In modern times, these regions were defined as the political boundaries between nations, and the sects within the boundaries sometimes even collaborated with the government. The alliance officially recognised and \"tolerated\" by the empire was designated as the orthodox sects. The sects that the government opposed vigorously, generally due to horrendous practices, were called unorthodox sects. To elaborate on that point, a bandit camp of regular mortals was just a regular bandit camp. However, if the leader of the camp was a mage with decently advanced cultivation, and if one or more members of the group were also mages, the bandit camp would become an unorthodox sect by definition. \n\nNowadays, though, not many large and powerful unorthodox sects proliferated in the Solar Empire. That is because criminals associated with unorthodox sects were subject to heavy policing and scorched earth preventative measures employed by the government, clans and sects. The last true conflict that shook the entire region and motivated the orthodox alliance to make a move was the Plague of Dark Cleansing. The Cloudstrider Sect happened to play a key role in chasing Ziva out of the region. They would have killed him, if not for the intervention from the Blackstar Kingdom in the North. \n\nNow Ziva Lune operated his own sect in that region, which was incidentally classified as an orthodox sect in that area even though he practised magic involving a tonne of grotesque human experimentation. Although the Cloudstrider Sect couldn't impede into the region controlled by their neighbouring alliance, one of their current tasks revolved around tracking any unwelcome movement and invasions from their neighbours.\n\nApart from that, the Cloudstrider Sect's general operation was wholly bland - they didn't even deign to undertake common escort missions and protection missions for merchant caravans and other clients like the less renowned sects. Maybe it was because of its age and heritage, but as Guy progressed through the records, he found that the sect became less and less adventurous in its activities. It had essentially devolved into an endless cycle of recruitment, tournaments and competitions, intermittent exploratory trips to quell the burgeoning population of dangerous beasts.\n\nHowever, the Sect had to propagate somehow. To that end, the Sect conducted mass recruitments every ten years, sparser than the less prominent sects in the orthodox alliance. The sects nowadays had three divisions: Outer, Inner and Core. The horde that entered the Sect would become part of the Outer Division, where they would have to compete against each other, to a brutal degree, to gain resources and advance in their cultivations. They wouldn't receive any support apart from perfunctory lectures explaining the base cultivation method. Only a measly 1% could get promoted to the Inner Division, at which point there was an even tougher competition to gain the recognition of a sect elder to become their Disciple. That would qualify them as Core Division members, automatically moving them to a track for an elder position of some kind in the future.\n\nAs Guy finished a record describing the day-to-day occurrences in the Outer Division from the past year, his chest undulated with disgust.\n\n'They're being treated worse than animals!'\n\nAn Outer Division disciple was basically a slave. They were treated with no dignity by the Inner and Core members. Even amongst themselves, they had no camaraderie since only those with grit and cunning could accumulate enough resources to advance. Those that couldn't advance were infinitely tethered to the Sect, forced to live the rest of their lives as indentured slaves with no prospects. Most of the Outer Division members would die due to the unforgiving environment.\n\n'They don't even have the decency to commemorate their names?'\n\nThey were all numbers. A footnote on the ledger. Only Guy could see the blood oozing from the ink that dotted the decimal defining the percentage of Outer Division member \"turnover\". It reminded Guy of a horrendous hypothetical experiment he had heard of in his past life. Basically, a pot was filled with a myriad of highly venomous creatures and closed shut. The pot was left as-is for days on end. The critters stuck within were forced to fight amongst each other for survival, surviving against the venomous strikes of their fellow prisoners. After much time passed, the lid would be opened to reveal the single victor of the bloodsport, the critter with venom to surpass all venoms. This was how the Sect's Outer Division was being managed.\n\n'I cannot run my sect like this... Not in good conscience...' Guy reaffirmed.\n\nThe Archives did not expand on the workings of the Outer Division beyond the basics. However, Guy could fill in the blanks by himself, much to his disgust.\n\nCoincidentally, another individual was gaining a clearer view of the true treatment of Outer Division sect members first-hand.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-173]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":45,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 171 - Read, Reserve, Rinse, Repeat","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nGuy and Markus followed the bald figure leading them through the alleys within the sect as it weaved through the carved out floating mountain. However, rather than observing the intricate architecture and beautiful structures around them, the Master and Disciple were wholly enraptured by the reflective, semi-spherical surface bobbing up and down in front of them.\n\n\"He's definitely in the Core Formation realm. I can't gauge his cultivation,\" Guy explained in a low whisper.\n\n\"But then why is he bald?\" Markus retorted in disbelief in an equally hushed tone.\n\n\"I don't know, why don't you ask him?\"\n\n\"Me? W-Why?\"\n\n\"You were the one who pointed it out,\" Guy scoffed back. \"I didn't care one bit about it. But now that it's been brought to my attention I just CAN'T ignore it.\"\n\n\"I can hear you, you know...\" An exasperated voice spoke up as the man leading them came to a sudden halt. He then turned abruptly and faced the gossiping duo with a deathly glare.\n\n\"We don't mean any offence,\" Guy acted immediately. He regretted entertaining his Disciple in this jest. After living in a comfortable setting, the boy had clearly lost his instinct toward danger and had landed both of them in a treacherous situation.\n\n\"We are just curious. After advancing into the Core Formation realm, I believe you have the opportunity to reforge your body to your liking. Was it a conscious decision to go with a...\" Guy lightly waved his finger in the direction of the man's exposed head.\n\n\"Mas- I mean Mage Larks,\" Markus chimed in hurriedly. \"It is probably in pursuit of optimisation. Hair just gets everywhere, it blocks your vision, hampers your speed, and is also prone to get tugged during a fight. Going clean-shaven is obviously a tactical choice.\"\n\nMarkus flashed an impressed thumbs-up at the bald mage, who was trembling visibly at this point due to either embarrassment or fury.\n\n\"Of course!\" Guy volleyed with a dazzled expression. \"Hair is just a hindrance. You were moulding your body to match the optimal human form, which is of course hairless.\"\n\n\"Why is it that everyone has a problem with my baldness when no one even questions why Elder Glista and Teacher Jeeves choose to not regress their age and assume an older form?\" The man said with a defeated exhale.\n\nWith a raised volume, he continued, \"The men of my family suffer from early-onset baldness. By the time I reached sixteen years of age, I had already lost all of my hair..\"\n\nGuy and Markus leaned forward as the man paused in suspense. He glared at the two one last time before speaking with a hushed tone in embarrassment, \"When it came time to reforge my body at the stepping off point into Core Formation, I... I couldn't even imagine what I would look like with my hair. My father didn't have any hair, and neither did my grandfathers on both my mother's and father's side... Every image that formed in my mind looked just so... awkward. I couldn't revert to my fifteen-year-old form... I had no other option...\"\n\n\"I... apologise for making you recollect those unpleasant memories,\" Guy consoled the slouching man.\n\n\"We were being inconsiderate,\" Markus added.\n\nThe man's dreary eyes gained some colour upon hearing the duo's apology. Actually, this wasn't his first time receiving criticism about his unusually barren scalp. After all, it was highly unusual to see a mage in the Core Formation realm \"opting\" to go with such an... unflattering stylistic choice when it was completely possible to become the best version of themselves. But the thing was, he could never imagine himself with hair. Maybe it was a curse that plagued his family for generations upon generations that had even seeped into his mentality and warped his image of self. Since a young age, he had been egged and bullied by his peers for his affliction, which was further worsened when his physical reforging of the self left his already sparkling scalp a lot more lustrous.\n\nAfter a while, he had become numb. However, when the two guests following him pointed out his only weakness, his suppressed frustrations started to boil over. They were weaker than him, how dare they make fun of him? He was on the verge of breaking out and teaching them a lesson they wouldn't forget, even if they were guests of Elder Glista.\n\nBut, they apologised. It wasn't half-hearted - seething with disdain coated with a facade of sincerity. No, it was pure and from the heart. They didn't intend to offend him and they meant it.\n\nThe man coughed lightly and scratched his smooth head, \"It's fine. I've gotten used to it.\"\n\n\"Anyways, we have arrived at the Archives.\"\n\nThe man turned around and pointed at the door before him. They were currently well inside the mountain, probably someplace close to its core. The Archive wasn't a building, it was an excavated quarter, with a single entrance which was the large ingress in front of the group. The man approached the doors and placed a token from inside his cloak into a circular slot. The token lit up with a faint blue glow, which started to extend outwards extending into an intricate geometric pattern all across the large stone doors. With a booming growl, the doors slid inwards revealing a set of steps leading further into the mountain.\n\n\"Only one of you can enter,\" the man emphasised. \"Gaining access to the Archives is a privilege, not one that is offered to outsiders such as yourselves. Even within the Sect, only those with years of service and achievements in their belts and with recognition from the Elders have access to these Archives. Even though the Archives do not hold any sensitive grimoires or manuals, they hold intimate information about the history of our Sect. Therefore, you only have six hours to peruse whatever you like in there. When the time is elapsed, you will be immediately ejected from the Archives by the formations within.\"\n\n\"I will be entering,\" Guy said. \"While I am in there, can Student Reva here observe the rest of the Sect?\"\n\n\"The tokens given to you by Elder Glista give you full access to most locations in the Sect,\" the man replied with a nod. \"The token with respond negatively if a location is off-limits. Do not fight against it. Even Elder Glista cannot save you if you get into trouble.\"\n\nAnd with that established, the Master and Disciple split into their assigned tasks.\n\n____\n\n\"Six hours should be more than enough,\" Guy said out loud with palpable excitement. Although his mental faculties had risen after his advancement, they weren't exceedingly beyond human limits. He could memorise more content verbatim than before, but the increase was somewhere between 200% to 300% of his initial capacity. His processing speed also rose by a similar amount, however all that should not be enough for him to internalise the mountain of books stored inside the Archive.\n\nClearly, the Sect had a very rich history since there were rows upon rows of shelves each stacked full of similarly bound books. Although there was a sizeable amount in total, there weren't as many as the number of books available in the accessible section of the library at the Radiant Academy.\n\nHowever, Guy had an advantage that others in his position lacked. 'Maybe except Jo Way...'\n\nThat's right, the RoK!\n\nGuy's growing smile faltered as he recollected the sudden lack of a certain entity in that arcane compartment of his soul.\n\n'It's fine. The RoK works exactly as it used to, with or without him...'\n\nAfter cleansing his mind of all distracting thoughts, Guy got down to scanning through the books once again. Compared to his time in the Academy's library, there was a tighter time crunch that inhibited him from properly absorbing the content he was reading. Instead, Guy applied his speed-reading techniques to go through the book.\n\nSpeed-reading was a skill Guy was thoroughly intimated with from his past life. He hadn't applied it much in this iteration since it wasn't necessary. And Guy was not fond of using that skill since it greatly detracted from the enjoyment of completing a book at a leisurely pace.\n\nThere were many elements involved in becoming an effective speed-reader. The first was achieving a steady reading pace. Oftentimes, the thing that slowed people down the most is when they lost track of where they were on a page, especially when reaching a line break. Following text simply with the eye wasn't always tractable, it was also easy to get distracted when doing this. Guy tackled this problem by following the text with his index finger, just like how he taught Kano. The finger moved at a swift yet steady pace across the page like a typewriter.\n\nAnother folly committed by novice readers was in repeating the content being read in their minds using their \"inner voice\". It is a common habit that, while allowing the reader to create a vibrant tapestry of voices and characters in their mind space, significantly hampers the reading rate. This took some time for Guy to suppress, but through repeated practice Guy learned how to shut down the voice orating the read content in his head.\n\nIn addition to this, Guy learned that reading can be optimised if time isn't being wasted in moving the pupils sideways to track the read text. Usually, when humans read a text of any kind, their pupils jerk between the ends of the sentence which is not efficient. Instead, by training the peripheral vision to absorb text at the start and end of a line while keeping the gaze affixed to the centre of the line, one can increase their reading speed.\n\nThrough repeated practice, Guy optimised his speed reading skills. Some minor techniques he developed through this process include reading phrases as opposed to words, phasing out his retention when reading articles ('a', 'an', 'it', etc.) and unimportant parts of speech, and only grasping at keywords and using intuition to fill in the blanks. All in all, Guy had trained himself into a speed reading demon.\n\nAfter arriving in this world, Guy did give it a try and was pleasantly surprised to find that the process had become a lot easier. Thanks to the mana sense, he could now see EVERYTHING on a page without having to move his eyes. Thanks to his improved mental faculties and physique, he could scan through the text and flip pages at inhuman speeds. Although he wasn't internalising the content as well as if he were reading it thoroughly, it was sufficient to replicate the book inside the RoK.\n\nWithin a minute, Guy had already picked up and put back a book which was at least an inch thick. Through a rough calculation, he was reading at around 160000 words per minute, which was at least double the world record for speed reading back on Earth!\n\nGuy's eyes roamed over the shelves once again as his brain ran a few more arithmetic operations. \"I should be able to complete 93% of the books in here. I should prioritise records on Sect operation, events and expenditures. I should leave the miscellaneous records till the end if I have time.\"\n\nHe then cracked his knuckles and stiff neck before approaching the next book on the row of his current bookshelf and resumed his exercise in tedium.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-172]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":46,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 170 - No Questions Asked","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nA man massaged his silver beard while gazing into the horizon with a vigorous sheen in his eyes. His lips parted into a devious smile as his senses locked onto the approaching figure of another man, followed by a still adolescent gryphon carrying two individuals. His attention quickly diverted from the critters incapable of flight and the beast, and doubled down on the other man.\n\n\"I knew he'd cash it in one day,\" the man said audibly with a reverberating chuckle. He gazed down on his clothes once again - a redundant action since he could easily observe it through his mana senses - and fixed his black overcoat. He then dusted his black skin-tight shirt - another redundant action since he could easily dispel all blemishes with his magic - and casually inserted his hands into his black trouser pockets.\n\nAfter his final checks, he reverted his attention to the flying figure. As he did so, the man could feel his heartbeat hastening, he was getting agitated.\n\n\"This feeling,\" the man said with a near ecstatic expression. \"This excitement! How many years has it been since I felt this?\"\n\nThe man's impeccable memories didn't fail him. The last time he felt this way was when he fought against Al Jeeves. It was a feeling of intoxication. His every fibre of being was pulsing at a feverish pace as all of his latent battle instincts were called into action. It was the kind of battle he yearned for.\n\nA mage experiences three kinds of life-or-death battles in their lifetime. One when facing someone weaker, one when facing someone much stronger, and one when facing someone of equal or equivalent strength. The first kind is no fun, the victory is often known before the die is cast. The same sentiment is true for the second kind since the only outcome in those confrontations is death. The third kind is where all the juice lies.\n\nWhen fighting toe-to-toe with an opponent, one gets the opportunity to flex every single technique held in their arsenal. Because in those kinds of fights, victory is always awarded to the mage with superior skill, even if it is greater by a fingernail's margin. This was the kind of fight the man sought out so fervently. And this was the fight he got when facing Al Jeeves.\n\nThe man inhaled while positively shaking with exuberance, and honed all of his senses on the singular entity: Al Jeeves.\n\n____\n\nAl clicked his tongue in annoyance as a familiar probe washed over him. A mage's mana sense exists within the limit of their mana domain. Within the said domain, everything is in control of the mage as long as they have the knowledge to manipulate the mana to their liking. However, when two mages confront each other, a peculiar interaction takes place when their mana domains overlap.\n\nIn most cases, the mage with the higher cultivation realm wins. To elaborate, the weaker mage will find it increasingly difficult to cast spells and manipulate the mana around them as the stronger mage fully collapses their wider mana domain into the weaker mage. The victory isn't always absolute since minor manoeuvring and subterfuge can shift the balance ever so slightly. However, when the realms of the mages are close in cultivation realms, the conflict within the overlapping domain turns into a heated dance with each side vying for the faintest opportunity to cut through the other's barriers.\n\nAl immediately slowed his flight and activated a few spells inaudibly, essentially blocking the probe directed towards him. The victory in this confrontation was conceded to him, once again. This reignited the irksome feeling Al felt towards the man standing in the distance.\n\n\"We are approaching the destination,\" Al informed Guy and Markus. \"Remember everything I've told you.\"\n\nThe duo nodded affirmatively and looked forward, past the light mist which prevailed before them. Unlike Al, Guy and his Disciple's vision and mana sense were much more gimped in terms of range. They could only see a tad farther than a regular human, so all their eyes could capture was a faint silhouette of what could only be described as an upside-down mountain beyond a thin cloudy veil. Guy squinted while trying to gain a clearer vision, and within a quick half-minute, he was able to see their destination in its full majesty.\n\nWhat looked like an upside-down mountain was actually a massive rock hovering precariously off the ground. Along the sides of this hovering mountain were various buildings, walkways and structures that were bustling with activity. These walkways and structures snaked in and out of the mountain, like an elegant worm eating into a fruit.\n\n\"How is this even possible?\" Guy exclaimed.\n\n\"This region is naturally dense in mana,\" Al explained, \"When there is excess mana in a location, one can expect anomalous phenomena. Most large sects can be found in such mana rich locations.\"\n\n\"It goes against all laws of physics,\" Markus muttered.\n\n\"Mana truly is a mystery,\" Guy affirmed with an impressed tone.\n\nThe trio ascended as they approached the mountain, aiming for a flat landing space near the peak. As they rose, Guy observed the architecture further. The style closely matched the Mediterranean design motifs he'd seen back at Radiant City. Pillars and arches were in excess, with intricate sculptures and carvings peppered in various locations. The colour palette was fairly warm with a preference for natural brown and creamy shades. The paths had a cobblestone look in the public spaces, while near and inside buildings he could observe marble. There was also a heavy preference for open-air design, which felt weird given the cold atmosphere at the higher altitude. But things became clear when they reached a few kilometres away from the mountain. As though a huge space heater had been activated, the previously chilly area around them turned slightly humid and warm.\n\nAl observed the change in Guy's expression and said, \"There are multiple formations protecting the mountain. We wouldn't be able to enter the vicinity of this mountain unscathed if not for this entry token.\"\n\nAl fished out an embellished marble token the size of his palm which had a beautiful cloud pattern on it.\n\n\"Amongst the many formations, one that controls the weather moderates the atmosphere. Some formations moderate the mana concentration in and around the mountain to avoid causing mana poisoning to new initiates to the sect, or visitors.\"\n\n\"That's extremely convenient,\" Guy commented. \"And expensive,\" he added as he recollected the mana crystal expenditure required to maintain the formation.\n\n\"Thanks to the mana concentration in the area, most of these formations can be sustained without mana crystals. Some of the more active defence formations do require additional mana, but those are only activated during dire scenarios,\" Al responded.\n\nFollowing another sharp ascent, Al and Garrud hovered in place before landing upon an open area. The design of the flat region reminded Guy of helipads from his past life - it appeared as though this was specifically designated as the landing zone for flying objects.\n\n\"Al Jeeves!\" A gruff voice bellowed from across the landing space as it approached Al. \"In the flesh.\"\n\nAl growled back in annoyance and greeted the man with a rough handshake, \"Marek Glista.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't believe how surprised I was when I received a message asking for assistance, from THE Great Al Jeeves of all people?\" The man dressed in all black said with a mocking tone.\n\n\"Enough with the theatrics,\" Al shot back immediately while retrieving his palm from the uncomfortably long handshake. \"Let's get this over with.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah, ah!\" Marek responded while shaking an extended finger side-to-side. \"As a humble Elder of the Cloudstrider Sect, it is my duty to go through the proper rituals while welcoming guests.\"\n\n\"Now who might these two gentlemen be?\" Marek asked out loud without taking his attention off of Al.\n\n\"This is Guy Larks. He is an Apprentice I am training, and this is Markus Reva, a Student I'm personally teaching,\" Al said offhandedly.\n\nMarek hummed and said, \"The Student appears more talented than the Apprentice. And their physique is uninitiated to the martial path; they're weak.\"\n\n\"Both of them reached this level within two years. And you know that I don't gauge talent the same way you do.\"\n\n\"Intellectuals then,\" Marek commented with a contemplative nod. \"I take it back. As expected of the great Mage, Al Jeeves. No talent can be hidden from those voracious eyes, thirsty for knowledge.\"\n\n\"The same could be said for you,\" Al snorted back. \"Your nose sniffs out martial talent like a Bloodletting Moth to, well, blood.\"\n\n\"Is that a compliment?\" Marek retorted with feigned surprise.\n\n\"It's reciprocation,\" Al said with a sigh. \"Let's move on.\"\n\n\"I must say that I am a little curious. Your request is most unusual,\" Marek pointed out with a sly grin. \"What are you hiding from me, Al?\"\n\n\"That wasn't part of the agreement, Marek,\" Al denied immediately. \"The condition from our duel was a favour with 'No Questions Asked'. Are you reneging on the deal?\"\n\nMarek clicked his tongue and chided, \"You always know to keep me on my toes.\"\n\nHe then revealed a slight grin while tossing two marble tokens with an intricate symbol etched on them to Guy and Markus. As the tokens curved through the air and landed gently on their expecting palms, they could feel a trace of magic flowing inside them.\n\n\"Those shall give you unimpeded access to most locations within the sect, barring a few which shall be reminded to you by any guards stationed near that area,\" Marek explained. \"I remember that one of you requires access to historic records?\"\n\nGuy nodded and raised his hands. Marek clicked his fingers, again without turning away from Al. Behind him, a white-cloaked, middle-aged and bald mage materialised and greeted respectfully, \"Elder Glista.\"\n\n\"Lead the one with his arm up to the Archives.\"\n\nThe cloaked figure turned and walked away without a word. It took a second, but Guy caught on to the implied message immediately and followed the figure in a brisk walk, with Markus in tow.\n\nAl turned to follow the duo but was immediately intercepted by Marek blocking his path, \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Following them,\" Al answered with raised brows.\n\n\"You don't have an all-access token,\" Marek reminded.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You don't have access, Al,\" Marek repeated with a devious chuckle. \"Do you realise how difficult it was to convince the Sect Leader to issue the tokens 'No Questions Asked'?\"\n\nMarek wore a sneer and continued, \"I could only manage to wrangle two.\"\n\nHe then leaned forward and said, \"It appears that you cannot leave my side today, Al.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-171]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":47,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 169 - Meet Garrud the Gryphon","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nThe Gryphon named Garrud was Al's familiar. A familiar is a being of another species tied in a pseudo-master-slave relationship with a mage. The bond is at the soul level, is hence an irreversible process, and is generally a mutually beneficial relationship. As the mage progresses in their cultivation, the familiar receives positive feedback in theirs which helps them advance, and vice-versa. However, due to the ingrained nature of this bond, should either party face a catastrophe of fatal proportions, the other will face equal retribution through their soul connection.\n\nThe art of forming this robust soul bond was introduced to mankind by the elves of the Fae Realm. The sentient elven race was unique in that they were born with very low mana capacity and weaker physiques. Compared to a human in the same cultivation realm, an elf might have less than half their mana capacity and somewhere between two-thirds to three-quarters of their strength. Although, compared to an average human, an average elf had far superior aesthetics and charms.\n\nYet, how could such a weak race, on paper, survive in such a perilous environment of the Fae Realm and become the dominant species to walk those lands?\n\nThis was because the strength of the Fae lay not in their raw martial prowess but their superior spiritual capacities. While humans could gauge their mana capacities quantitatively, the same could not be said for their spiritual strengths. To date, the spiritual aspect of cultivation, more specifically the soul, remains an elusive topic for most sentient races. That is, apart from the elves. The strength of a newborn elves' soul far exceeds that of a mortal human at the prime of their life.\n\nThough many have tried to research this peculiarity, none have managed to derive a robust conclusion. Some believe that the elves' naturally long life expectancy, which is two and a half times that of a human, may have something to do with their high spiritual capacity. This is supported by the fact that it takes them double the time to mature biologically compared to humans. Others believe that inheritance and assimilation during fetal stages may have something to do with it. Elves have a very sparse birth and proliferation rate within their kind, which is further hampered by the fact that an elf mother gestates for nearly two years. Childbirth in elves is also much more perilous than in humans.\n\nNonetheless, the elves' large spiritual capacity enables them to form a symbiotic relationship with beasts of other species through familiar bonds, and this is their true strength. There have been records of an entire country being ravaged by a single elf in the Core Condensation realm and his horde of familiars - fighting elves is seldom a one-versus-one confrontation.\n\nUltimately, a rudimentary technique to form familiar bonds was shared with the humans years before the Age of Isolation, which has survived the test of time by being held firmly within the grasp of the Beast Taming Guild. The technique hasn't changed for millennia, not for the lack of trying. The field of soul strength and spirituality is just too complex for human beings and other sentient races to comprehend, thus rather than tampering with the existing method that works just fine, mages choose to stick to the status quo.\n\nIn the current age, if anyone wanted to take in a familiar, they had to do it through the Beast Taming Guild AFTER achieving a minimum of 2-stars. Another opportunity is presented to take on a new familiar with each successive star achieved. It was needless to say that very few people held more than four stars since each new familiar basically segmented the mage's soul proportionally to the beast's soul power.\n\nTake Garrud for instance. A gryphon is born with pseudo-sentience. Within months of hatching from its egg, the gryphon's cultivation accelerates through the Mana Condensation realm to the Foundation Realm, at which point they reach adolescence. A Gryphon's DNA is encoded with a rudimentary cultivation method that elevates them to the Core Formation realm where they solidify full sentience.\n\nAs expected, a gryphon's soul power expands exponentially once they enter Core Formation, at which point forming a familiar bond becomes extremely difficult unless the Gryphon acquiesces to it voluntarily; a mature Gryphon's soul power can rival that of a mage in the same cultivation realm. If there isn't a consensus from the familiar, a severe backlash can be incurred which will end up crippling the mage entirely.\n\n\"I found Garrud as an egg,\" Al explained to Guy and Markus who were clutching onto the jerking body of the feathered and furred beast as it skimmed across the skies. \"I formed a familiar bond with it the moment it hatched, otherwise it would have been impossible! gryphons are notoriously proud and highly territorial.\"\n\n\"H-How did you find the egg?\" Guy inquired while trying to control his chattering teeth. The sheer distance between their current altitude and the ground was agitating his latent acrophobia. Even his Disciple had increased the force with which he grabbed Guy's waist.\n\n\"Total coincidence! You wouldn't even believe it,\" Al blurted out as he soared next to him. \"There was a contract posted for exterminating a pair of gryphons up at Gold-Plated Hills quite a ways West from Twilight Village. Many heads congregated there to undertake this venture, the beast couple WERE in the Core Condensation Realm after all. On a side note, beasts in a cultivation realm are generally stronger than human mages in the same realm. It has to do with their superior physiques, bloodlines and one-track-minded cultivation methods. None of those distractions that humans suffer from, holding their cultivations back.\"\n\n\"So anyway, I wanted to try my luck out. I hadn't confronted gryphons before; thought about testing my might against them. And would you believe my luck! The gryphons had laid a wonderful gold coated egg!\"\n\n\"Unguarded?\" Guy exclaimed in disbelief.\n\n\"Not really,\" Al responded with a sly smile. \"It just so happened that two mercenary groups led by a few mages had coordinated an attack against the nest at the same time. You may be aware that gryphons are notorious for their capacity to hoard treasures. Their affinity to it sometimes even rivals dragons! The stronger the gryphon, the more treasure hoarded in its nest. And if there were two, the hoard would be doubled. The mercenary groups distracted the two gryphons, while I sneakily entered and swiped it.\"\n\nAs Al finished the sentence, Garrud jolted with mild aggravation.\n\n\"Oh drop it already!\" Al spat at the irritated hybrid. \"Your life amongst your parents would have been far worse. Do you think they would feed you all those expensive elixirs and natural treasures such as I did?\"\n\nGarrud vibrated reluctantly in agreement.\n\n\"He's a saucy little brat,\" Al commented. \"A familiar bond does not automatically ensure allegiance as it isn't like those slave contracts clans and sects use to control their protectors. This brat realised that he had been fleeced the moment he gained partial sentience, and he turned on me at that instance! You wouldn't believe how much I had to sink into him to get him to listen to me.\"\n\n\"What surprised me, though,\" Al immediately redirected with a confused intonation, \"is that he was so amicable with that girl. Garrud hates people, period. The last time I asked someone else to feed him, he nearly mauled the poor bloke to death. The girl didn't aggravate him - it's peculiar.\"\n\n\"Dora has a way with animals,\" Guy affirmed.\n\n\"No kidding,\" Al muttered. \"The weird thing was that I could hear her voice through my familiar bond. It was like a faint echo.\"\n\n\"You know, the more I get to know the people at the orphanage, the more I've come to realise that it is a treasure trove filled with talented individuals,\" Al declared spontaneously.\n\n\"Everyone's talented in one way or another,\" Guy chuckled. \"You just have to look deeper and with a lens free of prejudice.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\"\n\nAfter that, Al increased his flight speed along with his familiar's.\n\nAlthough Guy had flown many times in his past life, it was always within the confines of a pressurised metal tube. Surprisingly, he felt safer atop the back of the flying beast that when travelling via aeroplane. Somehow, the feeling of the wind blowing through his hair and the paced heartbeats of the beast beneath him comforted his mind. While within an aeroplane, the precarious rumbling and jerking motion always instilled a subtle fear in his heart. He did not experience the same uneasiness atop Garrud.\n\nGuy did have some difficulty keeping his eyes open as they started to gain altitude. The dry, cold wind bit into his skin and desiccated his eyeballs immediately. Through trial-and-error, he managed to form a robust screen of mana in front of him that helped separate the currents. He was just about to tell his Disciple when he noticed that Markus had already put up a similar shield in front of his face.\n\n\"We will be arriving at the sect soon,\" Al's voice reverberated in their minds. \"Let me handle the talking. I will lobby for access to the sect's record library. Through it, you will gain access to the sect's history and front-end management data and finances - all under supervision. The favour should cover that much.\"\n\nGuy and Markus nodded affirmatively.\n\n\"The man we are going to rendezvous with is extremely nosy. Try not to reveal too much about yourself. The more intrigued he feels, the more he will dig into your past,\" Al warned.\n\nGuy chuckled spontaneously at the irony of Al's description of the man. 'Sounds similar to a certain mage I know.'\n\n\"Finally. Whatever happens, do not interfere with anything that happens in the sect,\" Al warned Guy and Markus. \"I am a hundred per cent sure that the bastard will set something up to provoke a confrontation.\"\n\nAl gritted his teeth in frustration as he suddenly recollected the interaction from his past with the 'bastard' in question that led to him gaining the favour.\n\n\"It's because he LET me win that time,\" Al muttered to himself. \"I have to be extra careful so that Guy and Markus aren't caught in whatever scheme he is cooking up.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-170]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":48,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 168 - Journey for Knowledge","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nKrish hummed contemplatively while staring at the two kids who animatedly denied his divination. This wasn't the first time someone denied his prophecies so vehemently right to his face. Over the years, Krish had come to realise the juxtaposition of the human mentality. Whenever Krish's divination revealed beneficial truths or facts, the recipients are quick to accept it - overjoyed even. However, the moment the divinations revealed proclamations that run contrary to the recipient's expectations, they immediately reject it.\n\nAfter a short pause that seemed to extend for a much longer time frame given the charged atmosphere that reigned in the room, Krish sighed audibly. Al took that as a sign of exasperation and immediately nudged Jean from the back, adding on a few expressive signals using his eyes and face to urge her to apologise immediately. For better or worse, Jean was unable to decipher those signals, and even if she could comprehend she wouldn't act on them since her Senior Brother was holding his ground unfalteringly.\n\n\"Do you think it could be an anomaly?\" Guy spoke up. \"I mean, you couldn't see my future until that short blip. You can't see that same future in the fates of my Disciple, students and others around me. It is only a singular and, as far as we know, isolated incident. Right?\"\n\n\"Maybe you are right,\" Krish conceded. \"Maybe you aren't. If I am being honest it is the first time for me as well, to experience something like this. But I can tell you for certain that whatever the Heavenly Eye sees is absolute. Make out of it what you will.\"\n\nGuy bit his lips in distress while repeatedly chanting, 'That's not going to happen,' internally. 'That cannot happen!'\n\n\"Let's put that aside for the time being!\" Krish followed up to redirect the conversation. He knew that nothing good could come from preoccupying oneself with a future so distant. Having lived with such power for such a long time, Krish could ascertain that what some considered a blessing was oftentimes a curse. Like how a thief must constantly look over their shoulders for signs of pursuers, a person informed of their future must constantly doublethink their next step in fear of their dread coming to fruition. Little do they know that their hesitation and overthought can accelerate things further.\n\n\"Since your path is now free of obstacles, what are you going to do next?\" Krish asked Guy.\n\n\"Next?\" Guy faltered. \"I don't know...\"\n\n\"That's understandable. The decision was only finalised now. Logistics and action plans take time and thorough analysis to take form,\" Al empathised. \"But I must warn you to not it lightly. Creating a sect may be easy, but maintaining it is where the real challenge lies.\"\n\n\"I had a similar conclusion,\" Guy affirmed. \"It's not something I have done before, after all. I would love to learn more about it, though.\"\n\n\"Do you have any knowledge about sect management - the way sects work in general?\" Krish probed.\n\nGuy shook his head in response, evoking a long and contemplative pause from both the experienced mages in the room.\n\n\"It isn't easy,\" Al muttered. \"There aren't any books or journals about it either that you could use for reference. It's not like people just go around blurting out the inner workings of sects.\"\n\n\"What about observation?\" Guy blurted out. \"Do you guys think it might be possible to observe a functioning sect?\"\n\n\"That's a risky option,\" Krish cautioned. \"Sects aren't like Academies, in that secrecy and sovereignty are of utmost importance. You can't just waltz in, especially with such a flimsy reason.\"\n\n\"Although...\" Al said while elongating the last syllable with a contemplative intonation. \"Ah shit, I really don't want to do it though!\" He muttered to himself.\n\nRight as Al escaped his brief aside, he noticed everyone staring down at him inquisitively. He responded with a sheepish grin an explained, \"I might be able to pull a favour, but... the man who owes me that favour is an insufferable human being.\"\n\n\"I don't want to put you in an uncomfortable position,\" Guy responded hastily.\n\n\"No... No, it's fine. I probably will never cash in this favour in my lifetime, given that I will have to interact with that man to do it. Might as well use it up for this purpose,\" Al said with a twitching smile.\n\n\"Anyways,\" Al followed up while shaking his head of all irksome thoughts. \"We cannot make the journey through regular transportation. It is too far away, and also disjointed from regular travel routes. Unless you can fly, the journey will be impossible, I'm afraid. Thus, I shall prepare the transportation accordingly.\"\n\n\"Umm, where are we going exactly?\" Guy inquired.\n\n\"You said you wanted to see how a sect operated and learn. I'm taking you to one.\"\n\n\"Just like that?\"\n\n\"Just like that.\"\n\n____\n\nThree days after the enlightening meeting between Al, Krish, Guy, and Guy's students, an alarming shriek accentuated with a low bass growl of a large feline thundered over Twilight Village. The villagers cowered in fear as a majestic aura descended upon them, battering down in waves with periodic pulses of forceful gusts of wind.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Is it a bird?\"\n\n\"Is it a lion?\"\n\n\"Why is it flying down here?!\"\n\n\"RUN!\"\n\nThe crowd entered a frenzy as they rushed to enter the \"safe\" confines of their mud and wood homes.\n\n\"It's not coming to the village,\" a panicking kid pointed out. \"It's going to the orphanage.\"\n\nThe villagers stopped for a moment and observed the trajectory of the bestial shadow covered in blinding sunlight. Just as the kid said, it swerved away from the village and moved towards the orphanage little ways up the mountain.\n\n\"Should we go help?\" The kid asked.\n\n\"Do you want to die?\" The kid's parent blurted out. He then coughed audibly to catch his faux pas and said, \"T-They will be fine. Did you forget? Mages live up there!\"\n\nThe man's words implied assurance, however, his intonation was filled with uncertainty. In fact, the man had gained a clear look of the majestic beast flying above them. Through his travels to the town nearby, he had heard a few adventurous mercenaries describe a similar creature which they had encountered during their travels.\n\n\"They will be fine...\" The man repeated, more so to satisfy his inner anxiety than to calm his lad.\n\nIn the mercenaries' story, he learned of the most gruesome creatures to ever walk the face of Gaea. The mercenaries had told him that their group used to be a hundred strong, but only 10 managed to make it out alive, of which only five had all their limbs intact.\n\nThe beast killed first, feasted after. Highly territorial - it chased the party for many kilometres out from its nest. Ruthless - it eviscerated and disembowelled those that it killed with its talon-forelegs and beak.\n\nThe man shuddered at the utter carnage that the mercenary described. The man was inclined to believe the mercenary as the group shook visibly while they recounted those events.\n\n\"They will be fine... It will all be fine...\" The man muttered repeatedly.\n\n____\n\nUp the mountain, at the orphanage, a similar reaction as the villagers was elicited from Grace, who reflexively hid behind Guy. In turn, Guy had to try his hardest to hold up a brave front, when in reality he too was extremely petrified at the sight of a beast he had only heard of through myths and legends in his past life.\n\n\"Wow!\" Dora exclaimed excitedly as she hopped over to the beast that had fully descended to the ground in front of the orphanage. Al leapt off its back and immediately reached to stop Dora from approaching any further.\n\n\"Careful! He's a finicky little one,\" Al said.\n\n\"Little?\" Marie blurted out. \"That's not little!\"\n\n\"Is that a-\" Markus started.\n\n\"-Gryphon!\" Guy finished.\n\n\"Oh? You've heard of gryphons before? Although, this one is still a juvenile chick. It will grow much larger,\" Al expounded.\n\n\"He's not an 'it'!\" Dora corrected. \"He's a he!\"\n\nAl bit his tongue apologetically before narrowing his eyes in confusion, \"Wait! How did you know that?\"\n\n\"He told me,\" Dora answered innocently before ducking underneath Al's hands and rushing up to the large four-legged creature with a pair of wide wings.\n\n\"Dora!\" Grace exclaimed, but her voice was cut short when the creature dipped its neck and nudged Dora playfully with its hooked beak. Dora grasped the creature's golden-brown feathers around its neck and whispered into its ears while giggling intermittently.\n\n\"That's odd,\" Al commented. \"He's not really so pleasant around other people. Not after I yanked him away from his parents...\"\n\n'Did he kidnap this thing?!' Guy cried out internally.\n\n\"Anyways,\" Al immediately said after. \"Guy, come! Get on!\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Get on! I'll help you hop on to Garrud's back. Make sure that you don't pluck his feathers, he does NOT like that.\"\n\nGuy's eyes darted to the creature's extended talons, which were nearly the size of bison horns. The claws of its feline hind legs weren't anything to scoff at either - every time it flexed and retracted them, they left a visible dent on the hard ground. The beast's eagle eyes exuded an aura of inescapable danger. Yet, this ferocious beast had turned into a yearning kitten in front of Dora, who barely reached its shoulders.\n\n\"Do we really have to travel using a gryphon?\" Guy inquired meekly with an audible gulp.\n\n\"Unless you can fly,\" Al shrugged. \"Now stop wasting time!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-169]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":49,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 167 - Grim Future","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Is it right to just reveal my fate like this?\" Guy questioned with a tinge of worry in his voice. \"From what I've heard, there can be great consequences if your action changes the course in any way.\"\n\n\"Things that are supposed to happen will happen, remember?\" Krish winked. \"What I am about to tell you won't change anything. You won't voluntarily stop in your tracks - are you planning to not continue teaching?\"\n\nObserving Guy's lack of words, \"See! Since there isn't any adverse consequence, aren't you the least bit curious to know?\"\n\n\"I guess so?\" Guy muttered.\n\n\"I saw a great leap,\" Krish started. \"If the way the current world is progressing can be described in terms of architecture, it would be like a plain with a slight incline upwards. But with your intervention, a long set of stairs is introduced that leads into the sky with a steep rise and no end in sight. Now, this may sound too abstract to fathom, but that's primarily because I myself cannot put it into words.\"\n\n\"Can't Mage Nara use a |Soul Imprint|?\" Al inquired, with the thirst for knowledge plastered blatantly across his face.\n\n\"Not if you want both of us to die a horrible death,\" Krish blurted out. \"Certain secrets of this world are meant to be kept as such for the safety of the masses, boy.\"\n\n\"Nonetheless. Returning to the architectural metaphor once again: one would assume that such an endless stair would collapse under its own weight and instability. However, this stair happened to have the strongest foundations! It was built on the fundamental truths of this world - unshakable against all adversities!\"\n\n\"You've lost me there,\" Guy interjected while squinting his eyes. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"Hmm...\" Krish scratched his chin in rumination. \"You see, if I make my divination even a little more descriptive, I will be interfering with the trajectory fate has set out for you. So I need to choose my words carefully, and that is also why I try to stick close to metaphors and analogies.\"\n\n\"Let's put it this way then: You will leave an unimpeachable mark in this world. One that will last the test of time! The changes you will introduce will revolutionise the world from the mundane to the complex,\" Krish orated slowly.\n\nThe more Krish spoke, the brighter Guy's eyes got. The elation grew to a point where even his physical body couldn't contain it, causing him to vibrate with excitement. But then, the bubbling mood was burst by Krish's next set of words.\n\n\"Sure there will be a lot of bloodshed, but in the grand scheme of things it will be all worth it.\"\n\n\"Bloodshed?\" Guy quickly retorted. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Conflicts, deaths,\" Krish listed. \"Genocide. Maybe a cultural purge. You know? The usual occurrences during any war of conquest.\"\n\nGuy's back was immediately drenched in sweat - an involuntary action that even his superior physique couldn't prevent. It was the outcome of a fear that had been plaguing his mind. After the almost-hostile-takeover of his body by the parasitic entity embodying his split soul - the other Guy with a capitalised 'G' given that he was no longer a mindless being - Guy was constantly disturbed by a singular question.\n\n'What if the other Guy took over completely?'\n\nWould it have been a better outcome? Guy recognised that he could not achieve anything with his usual passivity. However, changing his personality would be difficult. Contrary to popular belief, flipping one's approach to life wasn't an easy task. In most generic web novels, the transmigrated or regressed individual often affirms a new resolve to live life more adventurously. They would declare that they would ensure this new life would be more meaningful and impactful, and they would succeed in doing so. Yet the truth wasn't as easy as fiction set it out to be. People who die, unless they were still kids or teens at the time of their death, have most of their character quirks and personalities already cemented and ingrained into their bones. Even if their body is changed, their essence of being remains the same. And as the saying goes, a tiger can't change its stripes. That is unless the tiger actively seeks to paint new stripes and cover up old ones. Sticking true to that idiom, Guy found out that unless he actively convinced himself to play his cards differently and policed his every action carefully, he'd end up reverting to his old, non-confrontational personality.\n\nTo that end, Guy felt that since the other Guy was a completely different entity it could be a feasible way to change Guy's current trajectory. But this was only logical on paper. To concede control to the other Guy would be an imminent demise of Guy's original self. Although Guy wished to make a change in his lifestyle, he valued his life more. On top of that, Guy also had an inkling of just how destructive the other Guy could be.\n\nThis belief was further confirmed after Krish revealed what was within \"Guy's\" fate. Guy could infer that what Krish observed must have been the future of the other Guy, not his own. For some reason, in Krish's eye, the current Guy was a dead man. Maybe it was because Guy's transmigration wasn't registered as a valid action in this world's fabric of reality. His entry had affected those around him, and the world as a whole though. But, every time Guy allowed the other Guy to take control, Krish could see a bloom of fate. This implied that the other Guy WAS a registered entity.\n\nGuy wasn't sure if the future Krish saw when peeking into the other Guy's fate was a fixed outcome, independent of whether the other Guy or the current Guy was in control of the body. Or if it was an event dependent on the other Guy being the sole controller of the body. Or maybe, he was destined to lose himself and concede full control to the other Guy, which was a bleak future, to say the least. Nonetheless, Guy did NOT want the future Krish divined to come through.\n\nGuy could make out that the other Guy was totally zealous and psychotic to a fatal degree through their short interaction. That man would go to extremes to achieve his goals - he wouldn't be averse to committing genocide to spread his warped beliefs of the so-called Absolute Truth.\n\n\"Do you see this future when gazing into the fates of any others here?\" Guy probed.\n\n\"I actually haven't checked that far ahead,\" Krish confessed. \"Interestingly, what I saw in your fate at that short moment began at a time point quite far off into the future. There was nothing visible in the immediate temporal vicinity. Doing so exhausted a lot of my mana as well, since the cost of using my power increases exponentially the further I look. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I hope that the future you observed doesn't come true,\" Guy said with a stern voice. \"It is not what I want my name to be associated with.\"\n\n\"Blood has to be spilt and lives need to be culled to make any lasting difference,\" Krish sighed. \"That is the sad truth of this world. People are naturally resistant to change unless you force it down their throats.\"\n\n\"Mage Nara does have a point there,\" Al chimed in. \"If you were content with teaching such a small congregation of students, your old approach would have been fine. However, with your current goal to make a lasting difference, it is no longer a feasible strategy to live a life with hands unstained by blood. You will eventually end up hitting a wall that will have to be demolished. At that point, will you hesitate? Do you think you will have the luxury to hesitate?\"\n\nGuy shrank in defeat. 'It is an eventuality, just like they've said. How will I fare at that point? Am I even ready?'\n\nHaving come from a modern world which was relatively peaceful, Guy was intrinsically against taking another life. He often wondered how other transmigrated individuals managed to change their personalities so easily to stomach murder. 'Even if I try to rationalise things as self-defence and righteous, I would only be deluding myself to feel less guilty.'\n\n'Argh! There are so many things to consider!' Guy groaned internally. 'Should I just give up? Is it even worth it to take make such a drastic change in my life? I was happy the way I was before, right?'\n\nJust as Guy was about to enter a self-deprecating spiral that eventually led to depression, Markus spoke up.\n\n\"I apologise, but I disagree with Teacher Jeeves and Mage Nara,\" the boy said firmly. \"While there is some truth to your statements which have been derived from your vibrant experiences, I think my Master is different.\"\n\nAs he paused, Jean shuffled forward and said, \"I agree with Senior Brother. I apologise for my frankness, but until I met Teacher Larks I was always led to believe that I would never be able to cultivate or achieve anything substantial with my life.\"\n\n\"I was led to believe the same thing. Teacher Jeeves may not be aware of the struggles I had to go through back at the Academy. Like the sheer helplessness I felt when everything I tried to push myself forward, ended up either fizzling in front of me or blowing up in my face,\" Markus volleyed.\n\n\"My father had me meet a plethora of experts,\" Jean continued. \"Uncle Jeeves, you recommended a few as well. How much were they able to accomplish? Compare that with what I achieved in just above a year thanks to Teacher Larks?\"\n\n\"The experiences of Teacher Jeeves and Mage Nara are relics of the old world,\" Markus evoked with fervour. \"That is the viewpoint cultivated by eras of suppression and segregation, and a society built on savagery disguised in a pleasant suit. Why would Master revert to the techniques of the past if he intends to change the world?\"\n\nMarkus gulped audibly and held a firm gaze targeted at Krish. The boy was intimidated but was trying his best to not reveal it outwardly.\n\n\"Mage Nara,\" the boy uttered. \"I-I believe that your divination is incorrect.\"\n\n\"It has to be faulty,\" Jean said in conjunction while using a hand to support her shivering Senior Brother from the back.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-168]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":50,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 166 - Ruthlessness","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\"My decision is influenced in large part by what I saw a little while back when you were performing the |Soul Imprint| on Jean,\" Krish began. \"As I've indicated before, through my eyes, your fate appears as murky as the Swamps of Garand. However, at that moment in time, your fate burst with a magnificent spark. In fact, this wasn't the first time such an event transpired, the same phenomenon occurred when you performed your first |Soul Imprint| on Markus.\"\n\nGuy's mind immediately formed a connection between this phenomenon and the two times he had utilised the powers of the mask. His expression faltered slightly, which wasn't missed by Krish who grabbed on like a pitbull.\n\n\"I knew it!\" Krish exclaimed. \"The events were special. Every other time you utilised your |Soul Imprint|, this did not occur. It got me thinking: What differed between those two instances and every other instance? No matter how hard I pondered over it, I could not come up with an answer, so I chalked it up as it having to do with your inheritance.\"\n\n\"First off,\" Guy interrupted. \"You were spying on me?\" There was a faint sense of irritation in Guy's voice.\n\n\"It's a force of habit,\" Krish responded. \"I won't apologise for it. I don't like being blindsided. My past experience has proven that vigilance is key to the survival of any mage. Teacher Jeeves here can corroborate this.\"\n\nAl nodded vehemently in affirmation like a little yes-man.\n\nGuy coughed, in an attempt to expel the disturbing feeling swelling in his stomach. Although he was affected by the breach of privacy, like any normal person, he could also empathise with Krish's point of view. Danger could potentially lurk around every corner in this world, thus precautionary measures were prudent. Besides, it wasn't as though privacy was in ample supply in Guy's past life. Corporations constantly tracked and sold user analytics, and governments - who are supposed to be on the side of the citizens - surveilled their citizens through flimsy protection laws. Certain social networking platforms could even offer tailored advertisements based on recent search history, going as far as to predict one's food preferences through complex statistical analysis. Compared to that, Krish's intermittent intrusions were trivial.\n\n\"You are correct,\" Guy said with a bitter smile. \"It does have something to do with my inheritance. Jean and Markus can attest to that.\"\n\n\"That's right!\" Markus chimed in. \"Compared to the other |Soul Imprints|, the one I experienced when I achieved perfected resonance was far more immersive and vibrant. To top it off, I can perfectly relive that experience anytime I want through meditation.\"\n\n\"Now that Senior Brother brought it up, I too felt the same way,\" Jean commented. \"The experience has been engraved into my mind. To be honest, when I first experienced it I was completely dumbfounded. Everything I saw was unfathomable, totally beyond this world. I thought that the vision was simply gibberish - a figment of a warped imagination. However, after reassessing it multiple times, I realised that the things I saw were thoroughly grounded in rationality. They were too... real to be lies.\"\n\n\"Can you explain what you saw?\" Al hummed. His inquisitiveness was urging him to pursue this thread. Jean responded affirmatively and expounded on her virtual experience. As she spoke, Al's eyes started to burst out further and further from his sockets in excitement. Everything was so new to him and magical. Of course, this irony was missed by Al. Living in a world dominated by magic, fathoming one without magic at all was akin to fantasy for him.\n\n\"Elaborate on this artefact which measures heartbeat, blood oxygen concentration and so on,\" Al demanded while straightening his back.\n\n\"Teacher Jeeves,\" Krish interjected. \"Let's not deviate from the current conversation.\"\n\nAl bit his tongue apologetically and regressed into the background. Krish's gaze drilled into Guy once again, egging him to explain himself.\n\n\"I-I don't know what else to say really,\" Guy said with a loud sigh, trying his hardest to suppress the twitch attacking his eyelids. \"I just found some knowledge pertaining to what they were struggling with and just... did my thing.\"\n\n\"Nonetheless, there was a difference,\" Krish emphasised. \"I can feel that you're hiding something. Don't worry, I won't be squeezing it out of you - everyone is entitled to their secrets.\"\n\nAfter a short pause to discharge the crescendoing tension in the room, Krish continued, \"The first time the phenomenon occurred, I was confounded and was unable to make any headway or gain any insights. But this time, I was prepared. I managed to gaze into your fate.\"\n\n\"Gaze into his fate?\" Al muttered. He sucked in a long breath through clenched teeth as he narrowed his gaze, \"Where have I heard that before...?\"\n\n\"And in that bright mote growing inside you, I saw an unbelievable vision,\" Krish evoked with awe in his eyes. \"Interestingly, it was a lot similar to what the girl just said before. A world beyond anything I have ever seen before.\"\n\n\"That's right!\" Al interjected as he snapped his finger. \"Y-You are the Golden-Eyed Seer! That's you, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It all makes sense now!\" Al continued hurriedly. \"Exactly 53 years ago, the Sunspot Sect faced multiple calamities one after another. The Sect Leader suffered a cultivation deviation as he attempted to break through into the Tesseract Transformation realm, resulting in him going mad and eradicating every single disciple present in the Sect. The Elders barely managed to stop him, losing more than three-quarters of their strength by the time the Sect Leader was subdued. After the Sect Leader gained clarity and came face to face with the utter carnage he had wrought, he ended up killing himself in his grief. The Elders departed from the Sect. Some attempted to join other Sects but faced an untimely death due to odd reasons. One Elder accidentally swallowed poison instead of an alchemical potion. Another accidentally swallowed an artefact of mass destruction and imploded. One even fell on her own vitality draining sword while in a deep meditative state and died a shrivelled husk.\"\n\nAl gulped audibly as a morbid silence took grasp of the ambience, \"A Sect which was by no means a minor contender just disappeared off the face of the map in one fell swoop, that too because of a multitude of highly coincidental events that just happened to fall into place at the right time. It was so monumental that even the co-operative of Teachers had to get involved. I happened to sit in during the investigation, which lasted for five whole years. In the end, we managed to narrow it down to one individual: The Golden-Eyed Seer!\"\n\n\"They stole from me,\" Krish grunted in exasperation. \"And then they had the gall to deny everything. I only did what was fair.\"\n\n\"The entire Sect was burned to the ground after the suicide of a female Thunderbird, whose spouse was killed and harvested near the Sect's mountain,\" Al continued. \"Although the structure was disintegrated, we assumed that the Sect's heritage would remain intact in some form. However, when we finally managed to open up the Sect's treasury, there was nothing in it!\"\n\n\"A price had to be paid,\" Krish shrugged.\n\n\"The many mistresses the Sect Leader and the Elders impregnated all had a miscarriage due to the absurdest of causes,\" Al exclaimed animatedly.\n\n\"That wasn't part of my plan,\" Krish denied immediately while alternating his gaze between Guy and his students. \"In a minor fit of anger, I may have made a mistake in the curse. By the way, the 'Golden-Eyed Seer' is a very mild alias. I assumed it would be more bloody given the level of carnage.\"\n\n\"The cooperative of Teachers and the Alliance of Sects wanted to go with the 'Evil-Eyed Demon of Misfortune', but they feared retribution!\" Al exhorted. \"If a person could eradicate a sizeable entity such as the Sunspot Sect so ruthlessly without having to once show their face, who would want to get on their bad side by affronting them with such an antagonistic alias?\"\n\n\"Did you really have to go that far?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Krish answered without hesitation. \"Although it left a bad taste in my mouth seeing how far my curse travelled, it was necessary to avoid future conflicts. Mages are anything but forgiving individuals - myself included. If I hadn't eliminated the Sect both root and stem, it would have inevitably led to another conflict down the line with a descendent. Now that I have a Disciple, it could have affected Marie as well. This is partly why I avoid mage infested regions nowadays. Everyone is just so sensitive. One slip of the tongue and you can end up with an enemy for life. It is easy to rack up negative social credit which is impossible to clear no matter how hard I try.\"\n\nKrish exhaled loudly to release his aggression. \"Sorry about that rant...\"\n\n\"I can empathise with Mage Nara on that matter,\" Al affirmed.\n\n\"Now that you've said it,\" Guy interjected. \"If you're so averse to interfering with mage congregations, why are you so eager to support me in my venture? I'm pretty sure that you will have to make an appearance in public and shake a few hands. Aren't you worried about your past catching up to you?\"\n\n\"Given what I've seen in your fate, all those petty conflicts are trivial!\" Krish evoked.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-167]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":51,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 165 - Al, meet Krish","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nAl was shaken by the sudden intrusion into his mind. This was partly because he could not trace back to the origin of the transmission - it was perfectly cloaked! To be able to accomplish this, the source must have strength far exceeding his own. Al wanted to revert with a question to identify this expert, however, due to the lack of a \"footprint\", he was unable to do so.\n\nThus, Al's only remaining option was to wait. Having lived for so long, Al was thoroughly inducted into the way of the world - the sheer brutality of it. He had learned, through bitter experience, that mages in higher realms were strange creatures that rarely operated following common logic or sense. That being said, Al himself was unaware of his own idiosyncrasies that had warped his personality. Anyways, certain actions that one might assume to be positive in a regular setting may end up offending peak experts - survival was akin to a perilous tightrope walk. With this in mind, Al made it a point to never, EVER, interact with anyone stronger than himself.  \n\nNow, a peak expert was lingering somewhere nearby or maybe even in this village - one that was in the Tesseract Transformation realm. Al held his breath and froze every single muscle in his body, and waited. He didn't want to end up offending this mysterious expert, so Al even completely retracted his mana senses. With his gaze, Al shot a warning toward Guy and his students, only to receive a blank response of nonchalance.\n\n'Shit!' He cursed internally. 'I should have warned them immediately. They wouldn't know how to gauge the strength of this expert. They are doomed!'\n\nAl wanted to unfreeze himself and offer some curt words of caution, but his body wouldn't respond to his brain's urging. This was the result of deep-rooted fear in Al's heart. After all, he valued his own life more than anyone else's. This wasn't selfishness, it was the instinctual and raw animalistic response when facing a palpable threat.\n\nAfter an excruciatingly long ten minutes, Al heard a periodic tapping noise resonating from the direction of the stairs to the village. With each tap, the sound gained volume as though it were approaching them. Through hasty deduction, Al affiliated this sound to correspond to the expert. After that, every tap felt like the pounding of a hammer against his soul. They ran in syncopation with his own heartbeat, at least that's how he perceived them to be. It was unsettling and claustrophobia-inducing.\n\nThe taps gained clarity after an even longer five minutes. At this point, Al realised that the sound was of wood striking the ground, followed by an awkward shuffle of feet.\n\n'A mage with a limp?' That made no sense! Becoming a mage was a surefire pathway to achieving the pinnacle of the human form. Although mages had the opportunity to mould their flesh body to their liking upon achieving the Core Formation realm, he had never heard of a mage who had willingly opted for a flawed - handicapped - form. This occurrence once again solidified the fact in Al's mind, that whoever the approaching expert was, that person had an eccentric personality. Al's soul quivered in agitation and fear upon arriving at that conclusion.\n\n'The more eccentric and bizarre the mage's personality, the lower the chance of us exiting this interaction with our lives intact!'\n\nAl wished nothing more than not existing in this place at this moment in time.\n\nThe life-draining taps and soul-grinding shuffle came to a halt right outside Al's tent. What followed were a series of unhurried knocks, and then a calm call for permission.\n\n\"Can I come in?\" The voice sounded familiar. Al had heard it before, outside the home of the pregnant woman!\n\n\"Y-Yes,\" Al stuttered apprehensively with a wavering tone.\n\nThe door pivoted open, revealing the figure of an elderly man, leaning on a walking stick about his height and sporting a washed-out cloak.\n\nAl's eyes were glued on the individual as they entered. Guy rose from his seat and apologised, \"Unfortunately, there isn't a chair here. Are you fine sitting on the ground?\"\n\n\"GUY!\" Al interjected immediately. He coughed to draw in the old man's attention and said, \"I-I have a chair in my storage disk, please give me a second. I apologise profusely for this sleight.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" the man said while waving his hand. With an audible groan, the man used his stick as support and descended into the padded ground. During this, Al caught a glimpse of a horribly desiccated leg peeking out from under the man's cloak. Al had never seen anything so grisly in his entire life. It was as though the flesh and muscle had been thoroughly consumed from within by a ravenous parasite, leaving just the bone in place. There were also awkward dips and holes on the flesh, as though rot had taken hold.\n\n\"Are you interested in knowing the cause?\" The man's voice dragged Al out of his stupor. Al realised that he had been staring at the disabled leg for an uncomfortably long time.\n\n\"Ah!\" Al exclaimed. \"I-I apologise! I wasn't expecting-\"\n\nAl was about to prostrate completely, when suddenly a force grabbed him by his shoulders and stopped him in place, \"Don't fret. It is a common reaction. It's jarring to see a mage sporting a limp voluntarily.\" \n\nAl wiped the cold sweat gushing out of his forehead in relief and gulped audibly. \"I... Would... Hmm...\"\n\nThe man understood the purpose of Al's repeated attempts to formulate a question and said, \"My name is Krish Nara. As you have rightfully determined, I am in the Tesseract Transformation realm. But don't worry, I haven't killed another human being in over seventy years. Wait, that's not right.\"\n\nKrish turned to Guy and asked, \"Does it count as killing if I condemned an entire sect to extinction which may have resulted in the deaths of the Sect Leader, Elders and a large portion of the Sect's members?\"\n\nGuy nodded with widened eyes.\n\n\"In that case, I haven't killed another human being in the last fifty years. And I don't intend to kill anyone for the time being either. Generally, such actions tend to incur a lot of negative social credits in the mage community, and in those situations, the sins of the Master reflect on the Disciple,\" Krish continued.\n\n\"Stop intimidating him,\" Guy sighed. \"Look at how shaken he is!\"\n\n\"You should count your lucky stars, Guy!\" Krish warned jokingly. \"I'm only keeping you alive because of your value with my dearest Disciple.\"\n\nGuy sneered back with mock laughter. \"Marie has rubbed off on you poorly, Mage Nara. Your wit was never this acerbic before.\"\n\n\"What do you know? We've only been acquainted for a little more than a year,\" Krish retorted. \"Unsurprisingly, my Disciple and I have a lot in common. Which is rather unfortunate since it is a monumental task to get anything past her contrarian mental barriers.\"\n\n\"It's ironic that in such cases, the instructor finds greater success in bending personally than forcing the pupil to compromise,\" Guy chimed back with a knowing nod.\n\n\"That is true,\" Krish affirmed. \"I never thought that in my thousand years, I would have to metaphorically bow in front of a girl a hundredth my age. But hey! It works!\"\n\n\"Anyways, let's get back to the topic at hand. I believe I can be of some assistance with your Sect problem,\" Krish offered.\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Well, Teacher Jeeves here-\"\n\n\"Please just call me Al,\" Al quickly corrected.\n\nKrish clicked his tongue in annoyance and growled back, \"Don't interrupt me!\"\n\nAl retreated with a whimper.\n\n\"Damn it, now I've lost my train of thought...\"\n\n\"I-I believe you were talking about the sect-\" Al said with a low voice.\n\n\"Didn't I say not to interrupt me?\" Krish shot back with anger in his voice.\n\n\"You're enjoying this, aren't you?\" Guy sighed.\n\nKrish burst into uproarious laughter, \"That's my revenge for staring at my leg. But on a more serious note, you don't have to be so formal here. I don't have the patience to process extra words of nonsensical drivel. Keep it direct!\"\n\nWhile Al nodded hurriedly in affirmation, Krish resumed, \"I can help you in your plan to create your Sect. I have a few connections that can expedite the process and possibly offer you some advantages. On top of that, as Teacher Jeeves pointed out, I can also act as your insurance. Once they know that a Tesseract Transformation realm mage is affiliated with your Sect, they will think twice before pulling something untoward.\"\n\nGuy hummed in contemplation.\n\n\"Why?\" He then asked. \"Why would you do this for me?\"\n\n\"Consider it a favour,\" Krish responded. \"For all the assistance you've offered in my journey to raise a Disciple.\"\n\nGuy furrowed his brows and said, \"I'm not wholly convinced. From what I've heard from Marie, you're quite detached from the goings-on in the world. Why would you go out of your way to assist me?\"\n\n\"There are reasons...\" Krish expressed, wearing a strained expression. \"Does it matter?\"\n\n\"If it were before, I wouldn't have asked,\" Guy responded. \"But now, I'm not sure if I like the feeling of being used. So I'd really appreciate it if we put all of our cards on the table.\"\n\nKrish smiled ominously and said, \"That's the right attitude.\"\n\n\"That's true. I always wondered whether you were being mature or excessively naive in taking things in stride without questioning the motives of people around you,\" Al chimed in with an affirmative nod. \"Not that I think that Mage Nara has any malicious ulterior motives-\"\n\n\"Just give it a break, man,\" Krish blurted out exasperatedly. \"Alright. My reason for sponsoring you here is twofold.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-166]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":52,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 164 - Brief History on Academies","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nTeachers, with a capitalised 'T', have become ubiquitous with the dissemination of magic and cultivation arts. Historically, Teachers are relatively new entrants into the wild world of cultivation, breaching into prominence within the last ten thousand years give or take five thousand. \n\nThe standard logic for a very long time was to hoard knowledge. To grow stronger in isolation, achieve advancements in cultivation, and go against the Heavens and all that. However, one fine day, a certain mage had a bright idea. She figured, 'Why should we hoard all of this knowledge when we could use it to help everyone?'\n\nNo one really remembers the identity of such a revolutionary thinker, because the moment she voiced her proposition out loud, she was summarily annihilated.\n\n'Who would utter such blasphemous ideas? Does she have no common sense? *Tsk* Women... typical!' The mages of that generation disdained her at that time. Yet that pervasive idea had taken root. More and more mages, mostly those at the bottom rungs of the ladder, started to congregate and share their knowledge in hopes of growing stronger. After all, nothing brings people closer than a shared enemy. And to these unfortunate bottom feeders, the powerful Clans, Sects and Organisations were the monoliths they could never supersede.\n\nIf those monoliths had been more proactive, and less arrogant, they could have nipped this growing threat in the bud, however, their unwavering belief in their superiority cost them that advantage. The appeal of being able to learn magic without having to sacrifice one's freedom was an attractive selling point. As more mages came under this unnamed co-operative's umbrella, they started to appreciate its superiority over the existing power structures.\n\nLombard Gronnlander was the first to achieve successive breakthroughs and breached the Tesseract Transformation realm in record time. His success was partly due to his strong first-generation Phoenician Bloodline, and partly due to the excessive amount of resources injected into him by the co-operative. The mages recognised the urgent requirement of a spearhead and face for their cause. They alone wouldn't have been enough to stand against the existing monoliths, so they immediately unearthed Lombard given his talent for cultivation.\n\nLombard was made the de-facto leader of the co-operative and went on to assert the co-operative's claim in the world of cultivation. There were many challenges and conflicts along the way, but the rag-tag groups of upstart mages held firm, and through smart and strategic manoeuvring, embedded themselves deeply into the world.\n\nMarketing played a huge part in this. The old monolithic organisations had reached a point where they had become unreachable to the common classes. Entry required some connection to existing parties or absolutely unshakeable innate advantages like physiques or bloodlines. The common class COULD enter monoliths through alternate routes, but these were often marginalised to indentured servitude for life sometimes extending to future generations as well. The co-operative, however, did not have such restrictions. Anyone could participate as long as they could offer a manageable sum of money as fees.\n\nAfter all, people hated to sell their souls for another cause but could tolerate selling their souls for money.\n\nThe co-operative decided to branch their image favourably by calling themselves Academies, and the instructors as Teachers with a capitalised 'T'.\n\n\"Are you a teacher?\"\n\n\"No, I'm a Teacher. With a capitalised 'T'.\"\n\n\"Ah! I'm sorry teacher.\"\n\n\"Capitalise the 'T', damn it!\"\n\n\"Right, right! Teacher.\"\n\n\"That's more like it.\"\n\nSuch conversations would spark within taverns, inns and restaurants. Needless to say, the newly formed Academies' marketing team was extremely effective in solidifying the public perception. Following a series of carefully calculated hits, coups and advertisement campaigns, the Academies and the Teachers started to overtake the monolithic organisations both in fame and power. In fact, they even started to gain support from the suppressed minor Clans, Sects and Organisations that had to submit to the might of the powerhouses. With a constant influx of untapped talents, and a steady generation of new mages and cultivators, the Academies had all the required ingredients to succeed through sheer numbers alone.\n\nOn that note, the reason why Academies succeeded where Clans and Sects failed was due to their independent nature. An Academy treated the Students and the Teacher not as entities tethered to the organisation, but rather as free agents employed through a thorough contract. This sat well with a lot of mages as no one of that stature preferred to be tied down by some flimsy reasoning of loyalty, servitude or obligation. Cultivation revolved around benefits, after all.\n\nAs more people started taking a liking to the format of Academies, and as more and more Academies started to sprout all over the world, the co-operative enacted their second step. They incrementally started to ingratiate themselves with the various guilds that existed around the world and brought them into the fold by inventing Teaching Licences. Now, Teachers not only had to have a thorough understanding of cultivation and magic but they must also be learned in other professions to a verifiable degree. With this new addition, Academies now catered to a wider variety of Students. This added stringency in the rating of Teachers set Academies apart from Sects and Clans who, oftentimes, specialised in only one licenced profession like Alchemy, Smithing, Enchanting, and so on.\n\nOver time, Academies entered the forefront of the mage circle and the arrogant Sects and Clans could do nothing to counteract this new phenomenon, as they were already too late.\n\nWith their new power, the co-operative of Academies enacted new laws and regulations that placed checks on Clans and Sects. They made it so that only licenced Teachers could lecture about magic in a public setting. Teaching Apprentices could do so as well, but only under the purview of an Academy or another licenced Teacher. However, the only exception to the rule was if the lecturing individual is a member of a Clan or Sect, and the listeners are also members of the same Clan or Sect.\n\n\"Why is the exception so specific?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"You can muzzle a manticore, but that doesn't make the manticore any less of a threat. Everyone and everything has a bottom line,\" Al commented. \"The monolithic organisations allowed the Academies to persist because making any move against the Academies would have put them in an unfavourable light. However, if the opposition from Academies exceeded the organisations' bottom lines, then they would have taken action regardless of how they would be perceived by the public.\"\n\n\"This leaves us with no choice, then?\" Guy inquired.\n\n\"I believe so,\" Al affirmed. \"I've looked into it, and there is very little that I can do to overturn the ban that Radiant Academy has placed on your employment to any Academy of magic. Maybe if it had been earlier, it would have been possible - I could pull some strings and make it go away. But now, too much time has passed, and your name has probably been etched into stone. There is no escape.\"\n\n\"I guess there's no helping it,\" Guy shrugged. He then clapped his hands together and blurted out, \"So how do you make a Sect anyway?\"\n\n\"It's actually quite easy,\" Al said while waving his hand. \"After the revolution brought on by Academies, Sects took a page from their strategy and began lowering the barrier of entry as well. Nowadays, just about anyone can make a sect. You need a unique name for the Sect, a unique location as the base, a unique assortment of cultivation methods to act as anchors for the sect and finally, you need support structures to hold up your Sect.\"\n\n\"I get the necessity of a unique name and location, but what do the rest mean?\" Guy responded.\n\n\"If the assortment of cultivation methods taught within a Sect can be taught by a Teacher, what use is a Sect?\" Al proposed. \"Basically, a Sect is only functional if it can offer something inaccessible outside of it.\"\n\n\"So if it is a cultivation method available in an Academy's library or by a Teacher, it is invalidated?\" Guy rephrased his question.\n\n\"That is correct,\" Al nodded. \"As for a support structure... How do I put it?\"\n\nAl scratched his chin in contemplation before explaining, \"Why do people have to think twice before entering a bloody conflict with the Rasmus Clan? Ignoring the plethora of experts on the forefront of the clan, of course.\"\n\n\"I don't get what you mean,\" Guy muttered with a frown.\n\n\"It's our Ancestor,\" Jean answered in his stead. \"The Ancestor's presence is the deterrent.\"\n\nAl snapped his finger and added, \"That's what I mean! Any successful Sect that intends to last the test of time NEEDS a support structure of some kind that can deter miscreants from making disadvantageous moves. It could be anything, ranging from a veritable mage powerhouse to an artefact or weapon of some kind capable of enacting superior damage.\"\n\n\"That is concerning,\" Guy chimed in. \"Is it necessary?\"\n\n\"It isn't necessary but highly recommended. Although just about anyone can create a clan, most small fries without a support structure never make it in the long run. They either get decimated by their competition to bankruptcy or absorbed by a larger sect, or in some cases, they just die.\"\n\nWhile Guy furled his brows in deep thought, Al clicked his tongue and commented, \"Regretfully, neither I nor Goran can act as support structures since I am affiliated with the co-operative of Academies while his allegiance is to the Rasmus Clan.\"\n\nThe group entered a depressed state after hearing that. Their momentum was quenched, and Guy was immeasurably disappointed.\n\n\"I guess my plan crashed before it could even take off, huh?\" Guy commented with wry mirth.\n\nAt that moment, a familiar voice echoed within the minds of everyone present in the room. It was through a Mana Transmission!\n\n'I believe I can assist in this matter.'\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-165]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":53,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 163 - Radical Idea","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"That is quite sudden,\" Al commented about Guy's declaration. \"And out of character. What brought about this change?\"\n\n\"After a rather harrowing introspection, I've come to realise a few shortcomings of mine that I feel need to be addressed immediately,\" Guy nodded affirmatively as he elaborated. He then proceeded to summarise his insights about himself concisely, vis-à-vis his aversion to conflict and extreme passivity.\n\n\"I don't see how that is a problem?\" Al responded. \"Your level-headedness and maturity are what makes you endearing.\"\n\nFor Al, being a little impulsive, forceful and aggressive was a common trait amongst mages out in the wild. This was how things worked. If one wanted to gain an advantage, one had to suppress their competition through brute force. In this cesspool of muscle-headed, arrogant troglodytes, Guy was like a breath of fresh air. His measured approach to life, and ability to take things in stride made him stand out, and it was this uniqueness that garnered Al's attention. Now, seeing as how Guy was planning to assimilate himself with the crowd, Al was a little disappointed.\n\n\"I don't intend to seek conflicts,\" Guy corrected. \"I'm simply saying that I feel like I could do more in this world apart from holing myself away in this village.\"\n\nGuy paused to formulate a proper line of reasoning and then continued. \"I've taken on two students of magic- let's say two and a half including Marie, all two and a half of them have achieved perfected resonance, and one of them has even advanced into the Foundation Establishment realm.\"\n\n\"Master!\" Markus exclaimed in surprise. \"Y-You knew?\"\n\n\"I assumed,\" Guy said with a cheeky smile. \"You aren't one to give up so easily. So if you've stepped out of your seclusion, it could only mean that you've advanced successfully. Otherwise, I fear I would have had to drag you out of your room by force while you struggled at the last inch of your life after exhausting yourself completely.\"\n\nMarkus scratched the back of his head sheepishly.\n\n\"Of the two and a half, two did not have a cultivation method,\" Guy resumed. \"It meant that they wouldn't be able to advance in the path of magic, yet here they are, standing at the edge of the cliff ready to leap into true magehood. Although the sample size isn't sufficient to draw a wider conclusion, it is enough to establish a hypothesis: We have the ability to help those without the fortune to cultivate, to do so.\"\n\n\"If I remember correctly,\" Al interjected. \"You were against spreading this knowledge because it would eventually lead to a proliferation of violence and conflicts.\"\n\n\"That's the worst-case scenario,\" Guy reasoned. \"Take a look at what Jean's accomplished! My earlier stance was dependent on a false assumption that magic's primary purpose was to bolster martial might. However, Jean has proven that magic has the potential to be applied in so many more fields that can benefit others. Furthermore, she alone isn't enough. Imagine if there were many more mages like Jean, with the knowledge and ability to practice medical magic of equal efficacy. How great would that be?\"\n\n\"You seem hard set on this,\" Al commented.\n\n\"It has to be done. I have a gift - a special power that brings with it an immense collection of knowledge, most of which I can't apply. However, my students have managed to make use of it and have achieved great accomplishments. It is a waste to hoard all of this knowledge when it could be disseminated and used for more fruitful purposes,\" Guy responded.\n\n\"It is the first time I'm seeing a mage so eager to share their gains from an inheritance,\" Al muttered. For any mage, an inheritance, regardless of its source, was an immensely valuable treasure. This was because if used correctly, especially if it is compatible with the mage, an inheritance can accelerate the cultivation of a mage by a large margin in a short period. Inheritances are essentially solidified versions of the cultivation of a mage from the Tesseract Transformation realm. This realm is regarded as the absolute peak a mage can achieve in their lifetime, so it isn't farfetched to assume that their cultivation is as refined, optimised and potent as it could be. Now imagine if another mage gains access to this highly potent solidified cultivation, and has the ability to siphon from it and bolster their own. No mage wishes to share such fortuitous and cheat-like advantages with another who could potentially rise and become their competitor.\n\nEven within renowned clans, large organisations, and sects that have deep backings, sharing an inheritance artefact with another member was a very rare occurrence. For example, although Goran was the current Clan Leader of the Rasmus Clan, he hadn't come into contact with the clan's inheritance artefact. In some ways, this was also a way to maintain checks and balances between these powerful entities. If word were to be leaked of the movement of an inheritance artefact within an organisation, it was akin to the arming of a nuclear missile. Opposing clans, organisations or sects would retaliate with a similar move, leading to a tense cold war that could blow over at the slightest provocation.\n\n\"I am envious of your open-mindedness,\" Al evoked while nodding his head appreciatively. \"No mage would be so charitable to publicly share their inheritance with others.\"\n\n\"Errr...\"\n\n\"However, I suggest that you avoid hinting at or even bringing up the fact that you have an inheritance,\" Al warned.\n\n\"Errr...\"\n\n\"Words travel quickly, especially if they contain such enticing keywords,\" Al added. \"Before you know it, mages will be swarming to this place to get a piece of the action. Once they're done, this village won't even exist on the face of the planet.\"\n\n\"Erm... *cough* Right! What inheritance artefact?\" Guy chimed in while sporting a conflicted smile.\n\n\"That's the attitude,\" Al winked back.\n\n\"But Master,\" Markus interjected at this point. \"While I am fully behind you on your decision to spread your teachings, I hate to point out a glaring issue.\"\n\nAll eyes in the room turned towards the boy, who was now feeling extremely discomfited. \"I don't think we have the certification or official qualification to teach.\"\n\nAl smacked his forehead audible while hissing. \"That's right!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Guy asked with visible confusion.\n\n\"Although I recognise your ability to be a Teacher of magic, since you haven't gone through the proper qualification channels - by that I mean an Academy of magic - you technically do not have the certification to teach magic to others. If someone were to find out that you're conducting these lessons on magic, you could get into a lot of trouble with the authorities and the union of co-operative of Academies and Teachers as a whole,\" Al explained.\n\n\"Have I been doing something illegal all this time?\" Guy exclaimed.\n\n\"Your nurturing of a Disciple isn't illegal,\" Al corrected. \"It is a personal relationship and a tradition that has existed since ancient history. However, again technically, teaching Jean when you aren't even a Teaching Apprentice is illegal and actionable to the highest extent of both national and international laws.\"\n\nGuy started to sweat bullets while eyeing the stoic girl. 'This girl is a walking lawsuit waiting to happen,' he said internally.\n\n\"Please rest assured, Teacher Larks,\" the girl immediately responded, as though she'd read the lingering fear in Guy's eyes. \"I am anything but grateful. May the world curse me with the most gruesome and painful death should I betray your confidence!\"\n\nGuy sighed in relief inaudibly before reverting to the obvious question, \"So there really isn't anything we can do, huh?\"\n\nAt this moment, Guy regretted his blasé attitude when he entered this world. If only he had tried harder and been more proactive at that time, he could have held his position back at the Academy. Then again, as he pondered on it further, a lot of good things had happened BECAUSE of that. He met Markus and his siblings, he befriended Al, and he found Grace. None of that would have been possible if not for his loss.\n\n\"Actually,\" Al muttered out loud. \"There may be a second pathway for you, albeit one that might be a bit tougher and could open you up to some unwelcome confrontation.\"\n\nGuy cocked his ears in attention and focused on Al. \"Although you need a licence to teach magic officially, there are exceptions in place that can allow you to bypass that restriction.\"\n\n\"How would that be?\"\n\n\"How do you think large organisations can accumulate so many specialised mages and warriors in their ranks?\" Al hinted. \"How is it that renowned clans and sects have the liberty to cultivate their own batch of mages with unique cultivation methods that cannot be found outside?\"\n\nGuy narrowed his gaze and contemplated along this line of reasoning. Now that Al pointed it out, Guy started to wonder how the clans and sects could grow their force without having a licensed Teacher in their midst. In fact, Guy knew that no Teacher was affiliated with a sect or a clan. After a quick half-second, the solution formed in his mind.\n\n\"No way!\" Guy exclaimed. \"You aren't saying that I-\"\n\n\"That's right! You can create a Sect,\" Al affirmed while completing Guy's sentence. \"With a Sect under your name, you have the liberty to go about your plan.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-164]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":54,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 162 - Guy's (NEW) Goal in Life","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nIf anything, the almost-hostile-takeover Guy experienced by his more zealous counterpart was a much-needed wake-up call. For one, he realised that his previous life wasn't as impactful as he had thought it to be. Many achievements which he considered monumental milestones appeared to have been built on a foundation of sand.\n\n'It seems that my accomplishments and initiatives were inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.'\n\nSecondly, he finally recognised that this world was much worse than his previous one. Even with all the unpleasantness that existed in his previous world, at least the society there was coated with a sense of peace. While most people were selfish, there was an incentive to offer aid to others. That feeling of togetherness was missing in this world.\n\n'Magic just makes things worse. Not only does it corrupt natural laws, but it also corrupts the humanity in people's hearts,' Guy concluded.\n\nOne couldn't predict if they would lose their life to a rogue sword or arrow, or even a virulent plague capable of devastating large swathes of territory. Poverty was rampant, widespread corruption and exploitation infested the civilisations, and the martial gap that separated the mortals from the mages had marginalised the powerless to a precarious lifestyle. To top it off, it didn't seem as though the existing authorities were willing to help improve the situation. They were satisfied with the status quo.\n\n'People could live such prosperous lives here. But everyone is too absorbed with accumulating power to look back and help others.' This world had become rotten! The other Guy was correct in asserting that this rot had to be excised.\n\nFurthermore, this world was unforgiving to both adults and children alike. The orphans in the orphanage Guy was living in were an excellent example of this. These kids were robbed of their childhood, forced to carry the weight of the world on their backs and unable to express their true selves to the world. And who knows what horrible experiences Grace had to live through that caused her to tremble at the sight of another mage?\n\nThis was just a small sample in the large scheme of things. Guy could already fathom the lives of the other orphans and children born in poverty around the world!\n\n'Things probably aren't any better out there.' Guy felt that it was no longer an option to sit on the sidelines and watch the world move in front of him.\n\nGuy acknowledged that things needed to change. His current trajectory had to undergo a drastic shift. This change would serve dual purposes. Of course, the first was to make a meaningful contribution to the world and make a lasting difference. The second was more selfish, and it was to simply piss Mast off!\n\nHe wasn't planning to intentionally confront Mast, since that entity hadn't done anything to hurt Guy - as far as Guy was aware. Furthermore, Guy was also grateful for being offered a second chance even if it was conditional in some ways.\n\nBut the betrayal still hurt. Mast must have a bottom line, but Guy hadn't infringed on it just yet. Presumably, Guy's previous trajectory wouldn't infringe on it either, otherwise, Mast would have interfered. Nonetheless, Guy was feeling confrontational. He wanted to see just how far he could push Mast's buttons, as a sign of silent protest.\n\n'Although I know that things need to be handled differently, the main issue I need to tackle is the concentration of power at the top. Just like with society in my previous life, those at the lower rungs of the ladder have a tougher time climbing up, while those already at the top can cruise through life without heavy consequences.'\n\nWhile in his past life, the deciding factor was wealth, the societal divisions in this world relied on magical power and cultivation.\n\nAn apt example of this could be observed in the disparity between the treatment received by Markus and Jean as initiate practitioners of magic. Without a proper support structure, Markus was forced to live off of scraps to gain footing in the Academy. Since he did not show any promise as a mage, his access to resources was incrementally shut-off and, if Guy hadn't intervened, he would have no option but to drop out of the Academy. At that juncture, he would have two choices left, which would be to approach a clan or a sect and work his way up their rankings through a more degrading process. Even if he managed to find some success, his advancement up the ranks would have a hard cap. This was the life of an average person seeking to pursue magic in this world. Those that had an inherent advantage through some form of genius, beneficial bloodline or physique, or even an inheritance artefact would face a smoother ride. The heights they could reach shouldn't necessarily have a hard cap, right?\n\nThat was another false assumption. Guy died in the early stages of the twenty-first century in his past life. During that time, many entrepreneurs made plays into the market in hopes of making it big, yet not many could breach a certain barrier that allowed them to grow. The hindrance came in the form of the large corporations that reigned the markets that were born at the tail end of the twentieth century, and the organisations that had support from the government. Heck, Guy's very own charitable foundation gained a fast track to pursue its initiatives BECAUSE of the backing of the Larks family!\n\n\"Genius\" mages in this world also faced such a semi-impermeable membrane when advancing through the societal ladder. At a point in their lives, they would be forced to face the monoliths that be. In that process, they would either compete against them, get absorbed by them, or get destroyed by them.\n\nCompared to Markus, Jean would have a much smoother ride through her life if not for her psychological scars. With the massive backing of the Rasmus Clan, access to cultivation resources and opportunities would have been a triviality. While she would have her own set of problems, surviving and thriving wouldn't have been a concern for her unlike Markus and his siblings. \n\n'The only way to tackle this problem is by disseminating magic,' Guy concluded. 'With the powers of the Church, helping those without backing to break through that semi-permeable membrane should be an issue.'\n\nMarkus managed to break past the blockages implemented by society thanks to the Church's revelations. The same could be said for Jean. In fact, Jean's recent advancement was a massive eye-opener for Guy.\n\nAfter observing the way Jean helped Chiani Lane give birth, and all the other experiments she undertook to make the lives of the villagers healthier, Guy realised that there were facets to magic that he had overlooked. The conditions at the time of his transmigration may have something to do with his earlier bias. \n\n'Magic is more than just a weapon. I was thrust into an environment that glorified martial strength. No wonder my view of magic was so heavily tainted,' Guy summarised. The Academy placed heavy emphasis on the weaponisation of magic and its application in combat. Although there were side professions that addressed other aspects of magic such as alchemy and enchanting, the roads ultimately led back to Rome. Guy did not see an application of magic that sought to improve the general well-being of the population. This was until he met Jean.\n\nPart of the credit should go to Jean's mother, who had journals upon journals of interesting ideas and applications of magic to target the degrading conditions of the non-magical folk. Where she failed was in actualising these theories. However, Jean took the steps to research these theories and produce tangible results.\n\n'Imagine if Jean's achievements could be applied at a global scale?' Guy pondered. 'A painless C-section without scarring, and danger to the mother and the child's life. It would be impossible back on Earth even by experts in the field with years of experience in their belts. But here, it was achieved within mere hours by a fourteen-year-old girl and a trained assistant, in a location without any advanced equipment or resources. I definitely wouldn't have been able to achieve this by myself here, even with all of my knowledge from my past life.'\n\nJean couldn't have achieved all of this without Guy's intervention, though. His injection of experience from his past life was what provided her with the impetus to operate. However, he wouldn't have had the inspiration to dig out this experience if not for Jean's request.\n\n'I myself don't know the limits of the power of the Church. According to the other Guy, I am barely scratching its surface. My mind lacks the imagination and ingenuity to make novel connections. The only way to learn more about it is by taking in more students and stress testing it,' Guy hypothesised. 'The more students I help, the faster my cultivation advances, and the greater my impact in this world.'\n\nAnd that was Guy's plan of action. His goal was to disseminate magic to the masses and shape their minds to view it as a tool for bettering society, rather than a weapon to enforce superiority. To do this, he had to target the segment of the population whose brains could be moulded and inculcated with positive values - the children. After all, a child's mind is unblemished and open to infinite possibilities. To achieve this on a wider scale, Guy needed to grow stronger as a mage. However, that could be achieved by the positive feedback he would receive from the Church by helping students.\n\n\"But where do I begin?\" While Guy had a good idea of the big picture, the intermediate steps to achieve that goal were a mystery to him. After careful thought, he figured that it would be best to inquire a more learned party, preferably one with more experience in this world. Amongst those persons that he had acquainted with that fit that bill, a single name stood out prominently.\n\nIt was the man who had helped Guy get accustomed to his life here from the beginning. With a firm and resolute expression, Guy got on his feet and trudged along to the immaculate tent set up near the orphanage, which was the temporary home of Al Jeeves.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-163]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":55,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 161 - Unpleasant Revelations","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nA few hours before Guy rescued Al from getting dissolved inside his Student's core. A long-awaited confrontation took place inside the RoK.\n\n\"I need to hear the truth, Mast,\" Guy declared. After entering the RoK, he now faced Mast's avatar, which also happened to resemble Guy's form from his past life. \"The whole truth, about my death.\"\n\n(What's there to learn? I've told you everything,) Mast shrugged.\n\n\"I don't believe that you have,\" Guy rebutted with a frown. \"You have been lying to me. I want to hear the unadulterated facts.\"\n\nMast tilted his head. He then waved his hand, causing a seat to materialise behind him. He lowered himself into the chair and rested his chin on his closed fist, which was supported by the table at the centre of the RoK.\n\n(Let's say that I have been deceptive with you, what reason do I have to reveal the truth to you?) He asked, breaking the charged pause lingering in the space.\n\n\"That's understandable. After all, the way you presented things to me, I'm just a small cog in the grand scheme of things,\" Guy hummed while nodding. \"But I do know that I am valuable to you. You have invested a lot into me, to bring me here and everything else that came along with it. This level of expenditure, and the risks assumed, implies that I have a role to play in whatever plan you've come up with. Therefore, I can say with certainty, that this small cog is what's keeping your entire mechanism from falling apart.\"\n\n(You are being uncharacteristically assertive,) Mast commented with a faintly mirthful tone.\n\n\"That was my greatest flaw. I've come to realise that, albeit a bit too late,\" Guy muttered with a bitter smile. He then added, \"I should have been more assertive in my past life.\"\n\n(If you had been assertive in your past life, you wouldn't have been able to extend your charitable work to such an extent. Oftentimes, the harder one pushes, the greater opposition they face. You were given the freedom to spread your work BECAUSE you were perceived as harmless in the eyes of others,) Mast responded. People in power have agendas, it is an irrefutable and immutable fact. They are willing to entertain anyone as long as it doesn't conflict with their agenda. This was the reason why Guy was given unhindered access to different countries to establish his charity. However, if Guy showed even an inkling of opposition or confrontation, his \"all-access ticket\" would have been revoked. The bureaucracy Guy managed to skip earlier would have been re-implemented, possibly with increased stringency.\n\n\"Sometimes, maintaining the status quo and introducing sustainable change may not be enough,\" Guy reaffirmed. Maybe he would have to jump through more hoops, but it would have left a lasting impact at least.\n\n(But it works. Given time, even the calmest of rivers can cut through mountains.)\n\n\"Stop beating around the bush and just tell me!\" Guy exploded with a forceful bellow while punching the table at the RoK's centre. His voice echoed within the RoK, accentuated by the hard drum from his fist meeting the ethereal hardwood surface. An intense, bone-chilling silence pervaded the ambience. Both parties present froze in place.\n\nAll of a sudden, Mast lowered his seemingly relaxed state. He stood up from his chair, and as he did so his avatar dissipated immediately, taking the world around him with it. Guy was now alone in a vast black void. Incrementally, he started to lose his connection to his senses as well, until eventually, he had reverted to the state he was after his first demise.\n\n(You want to know whether your death was a part of my machinations?) Mast's voice boomed around the void.\n\n(It was not,) Mast followed up immediately. (In fact. It was not a mistake either. My world is perfect - I have made sure of it.)\n\n\"Then-\"\n\n(Your death was pure coincidence.) Mast's voice lingered with an ominous vibrato.\n\n\"Just like everything...\"\n\n(Not exactly.)\n\n\"What?\" Guy exclaimed in confusion at the apparent contradiction in Mast's statement.\n\n(Your death was coincidental, but my selecting you was not.)\n\n\"Y-You chose me on purpose? Why?\"\n\n(Like you said before. You fit perfectly into my plan.)\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n(Irrelevant to you.)\n\n\"Stop hiding things from me, and tell me the whole damn truth!\" Guy bellowed again. Without his body to augment his confrontational demeanour, the authority in his declaration was significantly diminished.\n\n(I don't appreciate your tone.) Mast reprimanded with mild annoyance in his voice.\n\n\"Really? The base premise of our entire relationship was built on a lie, and you expect me to not feel infuriated?\" Guy challenged\n\n(The fault lies in you. You assumed our relationship was anything more than what it was.)\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n(I believe it is pretty obvious,) Mast retorted. (I am your benefactor.)\n\n\"Right...\" Guy muttered with a drawl imbued with bitter acceptance. He recognised his immaturity and naïveté in thinking that he could, in some way, have a close relationship with an omniscient and pseudo-omnipotent being such as Mast.\n\n(You disagree? You should have died, but you did not,) Mast pointed out. (I gave you a second chance.)\n\n\"If that is how you view things, then take it away,\" Guy shot back in a fit of rage. \"Kill me right now!\"\n\n(I cannot do that. You have not fulfilled your purpose yet?) Mast's voice responded. Its cold and calculative calmness came like a glowing knife, cutting into Guy's wavering soul.\n\n\"And what is it? To be a toy for your amusement?\"\n\n(Your purpose is to live your life. Just like every other creature in this place of existence?) Mast answered. The weirdly humanitarian nature of the statement discomfited Guy.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n(I chose you specifically for a reason. And that is to continue living, exactly as you were in your past life. Achieve every unfulfilled goal and wish, resolve every regret, just be yourself,) Mast repeated.\n\n\"I don't believe that your reasons are purely altruistic.\" Guy vocalised his doubts.\n\n(You are right to think so,) Mast said, bursting the nascent bubble of warmth in Guy's heart. (I hold no altruistic thoughts.)\n\n\"Then what is my true purpose!\" Guy demanded.\n\n(That is not for you to know,) Mast cut back. The void once again descended into a tense silence. The abruptness of that declaration immediately impeded Guy's momentum.\n\n\"What?\" Guy blurted out.\n\n(Our conversation has gone for long enough,) Mast declared. At that moment, the void prevailing around Guy started to regain its light, and the all too familiar sight of the RoK once again came into the foreground.\n\nGuy started to panic, as he immediately realised that their conversation was about to be cut short without him having learned the key piece of information about his transmigration. In haste, Guy threatened, \"I will end myself if you don't tell me!\"\n\nThrough the muffled silence, Mast responded coldly, (No you won't, you have too much to lose.)\n\nAnd with that, Mast disappeared. Although Guy couldn't see it, he could feel that absence of Mast.\n\nMany thoughts lingered in Guy's mind.\n\nGuy felt fear. One could say that Mast was the one constant that carried over from Guy's past life. It was the anchor that connected him to his previous identity and gave meaning to his previous existence. The recent confrontation with Mast completely shattered this belief. All of a sudden, Guy felt like he had become stranded on a completely foreign island by himself. The lifebuoy he assumed would keep him from drowning was a mere figment of his imagination. Fear was the obvious consequence. Even the most terrifying of animals succumb to it if the last modicum of familiarity is stripped off from their surroundings. \n\nGuy felt despair. From the beginning, he held a faint belief - an assumption - that Mast was on his side. Maybe it was due to the constant companionship offered by Mast's existence in the RoK, but Guy viewed Mast as a close companion and someone he could rely on. However, the confrontation revealed that the facade of companionship was simply a one-way mirror. Mast made it very clear that he didn't view Guy as anything more than a piece in a large jigsaw puzzle. It was a discomforting revelation and one that evoked profound humiliation, which shook Guy to his core.\n\nGuy felt infuriated. Every sentient being with cognizance of the sense of self, that is a being capable of questioning its existence, has an inbuilt want to believe that it has self-governance - that it has control over its actions and decisions. It wants the affirmation that it has control over its existence. Guy was indicated as such when he was offered a second iteration of his life. He was promised that he could live his new life the way he wanted to, and pursue his dreams. In fact, Mast made it a point to highlight this \"freedom\" during this confrontation. But Guy also understood that it was all a facade. There was a purpose to his presence here beyond what he was led to believe. Although Guy wasn't averse to believing that there was a certain level of predetermination in one's existence, what irked him immeasurably was the betrayal. Guy was enraged by the lies and the subterfuge that underlay his rebirth.\n\n\"Would things have been better if Mast told me the whole truth from the very beginning? Would it have been better if my second chance was footnoted with a conditional clause?\" Guy pondered. \"Maybe it was for the better this way. After all, ignorance is bliss.\"\n\nBut Guy immediately shook all those rogue thoughts and centred his mind. As he retraced his thought process, Guy realised that although Mast hadn't clarified Guy's purpose, he did say that Guy should just be himself and continue living as he had before.\n\n\"That's the thing! I cannot live my life the way I have till now,\" Guy concluded. \"I want my life to have meaning! I want to make a difference.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-162]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":56,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 160 - Déjà Vu","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nAl was pleasantly surprised by the satisfying squishiness of the red, doughnut-shaped units floating through the tunnel. Through some deductive reasoning, Al had realised that he was probably inside a blood vessel, and these red objects were the blood that flowed through them. Al had observed these cells, as Guy called them, on a few occasions during his past research work in medicinal alchemy. At that time, he had dismissed it as irrelevant as his work wasn't really focusing on microbiology.\n\nWith a mischievous chuckle, Al captured another cell and held it firmly in his hands. He then concentrated mana from his body and injected it into the cell. It was a pointless experiment from Al's perspective, but he was curious to know how these cells present inside Jean's cultivation would react.\n\nAs the mana entered the cell, it started to glow with a crimson hue. At one point, the mana injected reached a saturation point causing the healthy red colour to corrupt with a noxious blue tint. This was an expected reaction when foreign mana, which is attuned to another mage, is forcefully injected into a mortal non-magical's body. Unless the body is organically trained to withstand mana through cultivation or brute-force spell casting, the result is a phenomenon known as mana poisoning. Oftentimes, mortals can get mana poisoning by simply being in an area with an unusually high mana concentration.\n\nJust when the sickly cell disintegrated, Al's instincts blared with a vehement warning. Ever since the debacle inside Markus' core, Al had focused his cultivation on augmenting his sense of danger. He had realised that over the years of being unopposed and hiding away behind the safety of the Academy's library had turned him rusty. Unfortunately, his preparations turned futile as before he could make a move, his exposed hand and face were attacked by a horde of blueish-white blobs that grabbed onto him tightly with their protuberances. These blobs were relentless in their assault. Al tried his hardest to pull himself out of their grasp, however, they simply started to absorb him inside their viscous body and pulled him further in.\n\nOnce again, Al was assaulted with a sense of powerlessness. But this time, it wasn't due to fear, rather it was because those darned blobs were subjecting him to a battery of toxins that had rendered his mana ineffective, his muscles unresponsive, and his mind sluggish. It was a frightful feeling.\n\n\"Please... not... again,\" Al evoked with a strained voice. He was now being forcefully sucked through the small aperture, to be absorbed completely.\n\nAl's past mental trauma resurfaced once again with full force. Although, in reality, he wasn't as heavily suppressed as when under the influence of the black hole, he had subconsciously given up altogether.\n\n\"I guess... this is it...\"\n\nAl waited for the sweet release of death to save him from this embarrassing position. But it never came to fruition. Instead, he suddenly felt a forceful grasp and a hard yank on his back. With an audible whooshing sound, Al was pulled out of the aperture leading into Jean's cultivation and found himself back in the impeccably bright clean-room from before.\n\nAs seconds passed, Al slowly started to regain feeling in his appendages and found his mental capacity returning. When his senses cleared up, he realised that he was on his back, and staring right at him, was Guy with a face filled with confusion.\n\n\"I'm getting a strong sense of déjà vu,\" Guy chuckled.\n\n\"Don't joke!\" Al snapped back. \"I nearly died in there! What kind of students are you nurturing?\"\n\nAl rose unsteadily and added, \"I'm leaving this place.\"\n\n____\n\n\"Those cells that attacked you were probably the white blood cells, which are part of a human's immune system,\" Guy explained.\n\n\"What are they doing in there?\" Al bellowed incredulously. \"Why is this one's cultivation holding a space rending phenomenon that swallows you and disintegrates you, while this one's cultivation houses an unrelenting biological fiend that swallows you, pumps you up with toxic substances and then disintegrates you.\"\n\nGuy smiled bitterly at Al's animated exclamation. He wasn't sure if there was even a valid response to alleviate the man's agitation.\n\n\"That's it!\" Al concluded. \"This is the last time I'm ever checking any of your students' cultivations. I've managed to survive for this long, and I hope to live for longer. I fear I've lost at least half a century's worth of my life just through the sheer stress brought upon me by your two students.\"\n\n\"Were you able to find anything of note, though?\" Guy commented while trying to shift the conversation.\n\n\"Their cultivations are completely unrelated,\" Al shrugged. \"I found no similarity between them. The dichotomy is present down to the nature of the cultivation itself.\"\n\n\"Markus' has to do with looking outside, into the world. While Jean's has more to do with looking inside, biologically,\" Al summarised. \"Apart from that, I wasn't able to determine any connection to known cultivation methods. For all intents and purposes, their cultivation method is completely new and perfectly suited to them.\"\n\n\"That's unbelievable!\" Jean exclaimed. As an heiress to a prominent Clan, she was knowledgeable about the difficulty of the feat Al had described. \n\nAccording to her Uncle Jeeves, her cultivation method was customised to her specifically. This in and of itself was a monumental achievement that could only be achieved by mages at the peak of magic, the frontrunners, the veritable geniuses with godlike powers. One must have an immutable and irrefutable extent of knowledge of a field of magic, as well as a high level of familiarity with the subject to be able to devise a cultivation method for them. While the latter condition could be met fairly easily, the former was an incredible feat to achieve by a mage within one lifetime. Yet, Teacher Larks had done exactly this. At least that's what it appeared to be on paper. Jean was fairly certain that Teacher Larks' inheritance may also have played a key role here as it is a culmination of a peak-level mage's entire life. Maybe there were key knowledge fragments in it that might have assisted Jean in some way. But even her Senior Brother had a Specialised grade cultivation method, which also happened to have a nature contrasting her own. She had never heard of a mage being able to create two different, conflicting, Specialised cultivation methods. This suggested that the inheritance must've been from an unbelievably powerful mage - one with a vast repository of knowledge and experience in their repertoire.\n\nFinally, the cherry on the cake that threw Jean for a loop was the fact that this entire time, Jean had been cultivating without even being aware of it! This achievement was a testament to Teacher Larks' skills in pedagogy. How great of a Teacher can one be if they can induce an advancement in their students without them being aware of it until the opportune moment of advancement presents itself?\n\nThe aforementioned conditions are incredible on their own. But combining these two independent, and equally improbable events produced this unicorn of an achievement. Although Jean's face didn't show it, she was immensely grateful to Teacher Larks for everything he'd done for her to date.\n\nTill this year, Jean never held any hope of materialising her dream to become a healer. She had begrudgingly come to terms with her inadequacy. However, Teacher Larks had splashed her drab outlook with a beautiful and vibrant coat of paint, changing her life completely. Not only was she given a second chance to pursue her dreams, but she was also given new hope and goal to pursue. She was shown new possibilities and frontiers to reach for!\n\nA congested feeling welled up in Jean's chest. It felt warm and melancholy at the same time. Jean tried to expel it from her body by vocalising her heartfelt thoughts, but she just couldn't do it. At this juncture, the voices in her head - that had been pleasantly silent for the entire day - burst through immediately and dissipated the warmth into nothingness. Thus, Jean shrunk back into her seat and began suppressing the voices through a light meditation.\n\n\"By the way,\" Al said. \"What happened before at the village? You left the place so abruptly, and that too with a checked-out expression. Was there something on your mind that was troubling you?\"\n\nGuy sucked on his teeth as he pondered on how to approach the topic.\n\n\"Well... As I was helping Jean through her bottleneck, I was... how do I put it... shown a revelation of sorts. This revelation made me rethink my beliefs and actions till this point,\" Guy explained.\n\n\"That is common when using |Introspect|. A sentient being's soul is highly treacherous,\" Al responded. \"It is commonly believed that the sentient will and the spiritual soul, although part of the same entity, are constantly fighting to gain control. For a mortal, it is the will that holds the reins, however as a mage advances and attempts to reach immortality, they need to slowly let the soul hold on to the reins as well until the will and the soul become one. In the early stages, when we let the soul take a grasp at the reins to cultivate spirituality, the rogue soul will do everything within its power to take full control and swallow the will. It is a brutal feeling for initiates, and one can easily lose themselves in this process. But it is also a revealing experience as it presents an unfiltered view of our true selves.\"\n\nGuy nodded affirmatively with a contemplative expression. \"As you said, it was a valuable learning experience for me. So, after spending some time to digest the observations, I have decided to take a drastic step forward.\"\n\nGuy paused and then declared, \"I am planning to take on more students, specifically to teach magic and cultivation!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-161]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":57,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 159 - Second Plunge","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nAl hummed in thought before saying, \"If I had to put it into words, then your cultivation has a vastness, all-encompassing feeling to it.\"\n\nHe then turned to Jean and added, \"While yours is more measured, precise and focused. It also feels spotless.\"\n\n\"That's not helpful,\" Markus commented while shaking his head. \"What if we compare our insights - what we observed and assimilated that induced the advancement? Maybe that might reveal more.\"\n\nJean furrowed her brows in contemplation.\n\n\"It was less of a revelation, more of an inspiration for me,\" Jean started. \"I've read through all of my mother's journals thoroughly. I can confidently say that I know everything she has documented down to the minute details. Everything was so well researched and extensive. It covered a myriad of diseases, illnesses and traumas - it was like the pinnacle of medicine in my eyes.\"\n\nJean's eyes sparkled brightly as she shot a firm gaze toward Al and Markus. \"But then, I was shown a vision. No! I was made to embody a vision - a fully immersive experience - where I was presented with an incredible possibility. I was given a mere glimpse of the realms that medicine could achieve in the hands of mortals and non-magical humans.\"\n\n\"Curing diseases, treating illnesses, and assuaging traumas all without the application of mana. Can you even believe that?\" Jean exclaimed.\n\n\"Ironically, it was magical,\" she added.\n\n\"The moment my mind assimilated this vision, I could feel the limits in my psyche disappearing,\" Jean revealed. \"I realised that by setting my mother as my benchmark, I had put up barriers in my mind that inhibited my growth. Medicine could achieve so much more, I was just too narrow-minded and tunnel-visioned to fathom it.\"\n\n\"However, I still don't understand something,\" Jean said with a perplexed intonation. \"I don't get how Teacher Larks was able to show me that vision. Everything was just so unbelievable and foreign, I don't think it could be created through the workings of a human mind, that too within such a short time frame.\"\n\nJean then proceeded to explain every detail she could recollect about the experience. She covered the foreign clothes, the compact yet highly functional machines that worked through some as-of-yet unknown magic, the practised movements and synchronised behaviours, and the systematic ambience.\n\n\"Uncle Jeeves, you've travelled far and wide. Have you ever seen anything like this?\" Jean inquired.\n\n\"Not to my knowledge no,\" Al said while shaking his head. \"But you seem to be forgetting something, Jean.\"\n\nAl leaned forward and spoke with a low voice, \"These visions aren't the machinations of a regular human mind, as you've said. They are the workings of a mind that has transcended humanity. You should know about Teacher Larks' inheritance.\"\n\nJean and Markus nodded hurriedly.\n\n\"These are probably excerpts from what Teacher Larks has experienced through his assimilation of the teachings in the inheritance. We cannot judge them through a common lens. There are definitely layers of subtlety and implied meanings within that short vision you were exposed to, that you might have missed due to your limited understanding. Maybe, if you could unravel the whole truth, you might achieve an even greater breakthrough. Since it was a |Soul Imprint| the entire vision should be etched into your mind, I suggest that you revisit it frequently and decipher it to the best of your ability,\" Al advised.\n\n\"Teacher Jeeves is definitely correct there,\" Markus interjected. \"The vision I was shown that allowed me to achieve perfected resonance contributed significantly in my advancement to Foundation Establishment.\"\n\n\"I will definitely keep that advice in mind,\" Jean responded. \"Thank you, Teacher Jeeves and Senior Brother Reva,\" she bowed.\n\n\"It truly is a shame that your cultivation differs from Markus,\" Al said with a bitter smile. \"It would have been an interesting opportunity to learn more about Markus' unique cultivation.\"\n\n\"Teacher Jeeves. Why don't you |Extrospect| Jean's cultivation?\" Markus suggested. \"Maybe a closer inspection may reveal similarities that could have been missed through a cursory glance?\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Al scoffed. \"I'm not falling for that again.\"\n\nMarkus and Jean tilted their heads synchronously, displaying blatant confusion.\n\n\"*cough* I mean-\" Al quickly corrected, \"I don't think it's advisable with Jean.\"\n\n\"But Teacher Jeeves did it with me,\" Markus pointed out. \"I'm perfectly safe.\"\n\n\"It's different!\" Al quickly parried. \"Jean is... Jean is... That's right! Jean is a girl!\"\n\n\"How does that make a difference?\" Markus retorted.\n\n\"Well... I have to maintain contact with Jean on her exposed stomach,\" Al reasoned while sweating profusely. \"It's immoral!\"\n\n\"It's all for science,\" Jean shrugged. \"Besides, I treat you like family, Uncle Jeeves. It's not offensive.\"\n\nAl cycled through plausible excuses on his end but to no avail. Truthfully, he was a little scared. It just hurt his ego too much to admit that out loud. The last time he ventured into Markus' core, he nearly died. He had convinced himself back then that it was purely a result of his negligence and lack of caution that caused it. However, frequently during meditation, he would be reminded of the sheer terror he felt when facing that monstrosity inside the boy's core.\n\nBeing reminded of it once again, Al's eyes drifted carelessly over Markus' abdomen. A bone-chilling feeling of fear crept up Al's spine. 'Now that he's stepped into Foundation Establishment, how would his core have changed?' Al immediately shook that alarming thought and exhale loudly.\n\n\"Alright, let's get on with it then,\" he acquiesced reluctantly. \"I'm not as capable as your Teacher Larks, so be warned.\"\n\nAl reached towards Jean's abdomen and carefully rested his palm on her skin. He gradually started to calm his thoughts to enter an unperturbed state of meditation. He then proceeded to channel his mana through his palms and started to navigate through the girl's spiritual barriers. Again, because his intrusion was consented, there was no opposition when he passed through them. He quickly found the girl's nascent core and proceeded to settle his blurry senses.\n\nIt was a slow process, but once his vision cleared Al was presented with a completely bright visual. Compared to the darkroom in Markus' core, Jean's core space was unbearably bright. The floor was an iridescent white which blended perfectly into the walls, which were also emitting a spotless blanket of white into the room.\n\n\"This is the exact opposite,\" Al commented. \"The two are totally unrelated in every sense of the way...\"\n\nThis should have been enough of a hint for Al, and at this point, he should have simply exited the core space. But curiosity is a pervasive human quality. Al's eyes drifted towards a small puddle at the centre of the room. The mass of water could have been easily missed if not for the minor ripples that formed on its surface when Al walked around.\n\nA small part of Al's subconscious wanted to peek into Jean's cultivation. The moment this thought took form, Al's cultivation started to whir with excitement. This was because his cultivation was largely reliant on him learning new things and amassing new knowledge - exploring the unknown. Although Al had nearly died inside Markus' core, something good did come out of it in the form of a substantial leap in his cultivation.\n\nAt this point, an archaic proverb manifested in Al's consciousness: \"Every crisis has both its dangers and its opportunities.\"\n\nDroves of mages flock towards inheritance grounds, unearthed sites with abundant resources, treacherous zones filled with horrific beasts and elixirs, and so on, knowing full well just how dangerous these places could be. These mages know that they may not make it out alive. But they still choose to compete because they recognise that in facing danger, they are often presented with great opportunities to grow and achieve breakthroughs.\n\nApprehensively, Al approached the small pond in the ground and prostrated himself. He could not enter completely, so once again he was forced to only shove his head in.\n\nThe moment his face pierced through the strangely pleasant and warm surface of the liquid pond, which was once again in stark contrast to the chilling cold experienced when interacting with Markus', Al was shown a strange vision.\n\nIt was a dimly lit tunnel. It wasn't mechanically built but appeared alive and undulating. The walls twitched periodically, as a loud and rhythmic bellow echoed through with a muffled boom and with a strangely familiar beat.\n\nDUB DUB...\n\nDUB DUB...\n\nDUB DUB...\n\n\"That sounds like... a heartbeat?\"\n\nAl narrowed his eyes to sharpen his vision and observed the dim tunnel more carefully. With every beat, odd doughnut-shaped red units pumped past him.\n\n\"What are these... things?\" Al muttered as he reached forward, grabbed one of these doughnuts and squeezed them. The unit in his hand was extremely fragile. Maybe it was because Al applied excessive pressure, but the moment he pressed it, it burst magnificently.\n\nAl frowned and reached for another one. This time he applied lesser pressure and carefully inspected it, taking note of every detail he could glean from it.\n\nAs he was doing so, Al failed to notice a small army of spherical, blueish-white blobs with minuscule protrusions jutting out of them approaching him with sinister purpose.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-160]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":58,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 158 - Apology","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nMarkus exhaled loudly and stretched his body outwards while letting the cool morning breeze brush up against his face. He gazed into the clear blue sky, and let the first rays of sunlight invigorate his skin. Although not much had changed in the outside world within the past two weeks, everything seemed different to him, given his overhauled and boosted senses.\n\nThe vibrant tapestry of colours around him looked a tad brighter and livelier. The muted bumble of birds and small fauna, as well as the soothing sizzle of leaves as pleasant winds pranced through them, sounded more attenuated - louder but not overpowering. The mild smell of morning dew was further augmented by the lush fragrances of flowers planted around the orphanage. The taste of the usually bland breakfast gruel felt a bit more flavourful as his taste buds honed in on minor tastes underscoring it.\n\nOn top of all of that, Markus' gaze drew in an interesting new addition - an overlay of a fine, dynamic meshgrid extending in all directions encompassing everything, swerving around some, converging at others. It was needless to say that Markus' worldview had evolved and broadened since his advancement. This augmentation not only brought with it a unique perspective on reality, but also a battery of new powers and capacities that others could only dream of.\n\nBut that was a point for a later time. Markus' current goal was rather embarrassing - it was to apologise to his Junior Sister for his inappropriate display earlier. Markus forgot to anticipate the ancillary consequences of advancing into Foundation Establishment, even after witnessing it first-hand with his Master. If Markus had taken a second to inspect himself after advancing, instead of getting swept up in his emotions and flexing his newfound powers, he would have noticed that he was as nude as the day he was born and could have avoided the embarrassment of exhibiting his bare buttocks to his Junior Sister. Through this oversight, he had completely squandered every iota of respect he had cultivated with Jean in one fell swoop!\n\nAfter receiving a serving of reprimand from Matron Reva, he further realised that he had quite possibly offended his Junior Sister as well! He had forced Jean into an uncomfortable position without her consent. Being her superior and someone she relies on, he shouldn't have exploited her that way, knowingly or otherwise. Markus remembered that Master Larks had also apologised profusely to all parties present after the same debacle and explained his reasoning along the same lines.\n\nSo, as a responsible person who was at fault, Markus resolved to apologise to everyone starting with Jean. He'd heard from Matron Reva that Jean was camping out with Teacher Jeeves.\n\n'She probably feels deeply offended and is trying to avoid me,' Markus concluded with a dejected frown. With drooping shoulder, he trudged towards the tent near the orphanage which was Teacher Jeeves' abode during his stay at the orphanage.\n\nUpon arriving outside the tent, Markus pulled up his courage and knocked twice on the wooden door.\n\n\"Come in,\" Teacher Jeeves' voice resounded from within. Markus swallowed with a loud gulp before cautiously pushing the door open.\n\n\"Teacher Jeeves,\" Markus immediately greeted the elder mage with a respectful bow. The man was seated on a floor cushion around the low table in the living room area. He was wearing casual attire, which was in the form of a long cotton robe with a hood. Sitting opposite him was the shrunken figure of Jean.\n\n\"Junior Sister Jean,\" Markus greeted with a bitter expression. In response, the girl hummed lightly and sunk her head further into her body. At a quick glance, Markus noticed the girl's face turning a deep crimson shade.\n\n'I knew it,' Markus sighed internally. 'She's infuriated with me.'\n\nWithout pause, Markus immediately collapsed to his knees and bowed.\n\n\"I apologise for my earlier thoughtless display, Junior Sister Jean. Through my negligence, I subjected you to that offensive spectacle. It was not my intention to do so. I can only hope for your forgiveness, but I realise that it cannot be easily earned. As your Senior Brother, I have disrespected you and failed you,\" Markus rattled out with a heartfelt bellow.\n\n\"I do not ask for your forgiveness, but I am willing to do everything in my power to earn it,\" he then declared.\n\nAn awkward silence prevailed after Markus finished his piece. The boy didn't lift his head from the low bow, as though he were waiting for permission.\n\nAl alternated a confused gaze between the nearly prostrated boy and Jean, who had completely retreated her head into her body like a turtle.\n\n\"Could someone explain what's going on?\" Al asked out loud after failing to make heads or tails of the scenario.\n\n\"In my haste after advancing into the Foundation Establishment realm, I forgot that I had unknowingly disintegrated my clothes. I experienced a predicament due to poor maintenance of my physical body during my closed-door cultivation and called for Junior Sister to help me out. As a result, I... exposed myself to her without her consent,\" Markus explained out loud.\n\n\"You did what?!\" Al exclaimed in shock.\n\n\"I'm so, so sorry,\" Markus exclaimed hurriedly. \"I... I had no hidden intention.\"\n\n\"Junior Sister, please don't contain your anger. Unleash it upon me,\" the boy implored as he noticed the crimson hue deepen on Jean's face. He crawled forward whole on his knees, grabbed the girl's free hand and proceeded to slap himself with it. Contrary to his expectations, the girl's paralysed face cracked slightly as the corners of her lips twitched, and the bright red tomato shade started to creep down her face and tinted her neck. \n\nOn the other side, Al rubbed his forehead in exhaustion after finally piecing together the whole story.\n\n'Teen drama,' Al sighed. 'Misunderstandings and hormones are a scary mixture.'\n\nAl cleared his throat loudly to stop the farce from continuing.\n\n\"Boy,\" Al said sternly. \"You can let go of Jean's hand. She understands that whatever you did was purely accidental, don't you, Jean?\"\n\nJean nodded her head vehemently.\n\n\"Furthermore, she's planning to become a healer. Healers have to witness even more embarrassing displays in their line of work. I don't think a teenage boy's nude buttocks should affect her that much.\"\n\nTo that, Jean did not have a response. Al took her silence as affirmation and continued, \"Besides, enough with the dejected ambience! It is time to celebrate! Jean has achieved perfected resonance after breaking into the Late stage of Mana Condensation realm, and you have finally advanced into Foundation Establishment realm.\"\n\n\"You've achieved perfected resonance as well?\" Markus exclaimed in shock. \"That's amazing! Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\n\"I-I was about to, Senior Brother. But then...\" Jean's voice tapered off, but Markus could fill in the blanks. \"Congratulations to you too, Senior Brother! Then again, it should be expected from a genius such as yourself.\"\n\n\"You praise me too highly,\" Markus waved his hand.\n\n\"That isn't true,\" Al quickly interjected. \"The girl makes a valid point. You shouldn't downplay your achievements. You managed to break through into Foundation Establishment all through your effort WITHOUT a known cultivation method. And with such quick progression! Who would believe that you took your first steps into the path of magehood only three years ago?\"\n\n\"But I don't think I qualify as a genius. It... was a long and difficult journey,\" Markus commented with a wry smile.\n\n\"But what matters is that you've succeeded. You started from literally nothing - just remember that! There are people born with a lot more who've achieved barely a fraction of what you have at your age. You should be proud of that,\" Al highlighted.\n\n\"It was all thanks to Master Larks,\" Markus responded humbly.\n\n\"That is also true,\" Al agreed. \"If it hadn't been for him, Jean here would never have the opportunity to pursue her dream.\"\n\n\"Seeing as how you've advanced, there is hope for Jean yet,\" Al added. \"Now that I've sensed it closely, the two of you seem to have vastly different cultivation methods.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Uncle Jeeves?\" Jean inquired.\n\n\"Well, although I haven't performed an |Extrospect| to gauge your cultivation in detail, I can still sense it at the surface level. It's possible for me especially since the gulf between our cultivations is so vast,\" Al started. \"That said when I compare what I sense when observing your cultivation with what I experienced within Markus, it is evident that they are not related in any way.\"\n\n\"How is that possible?\" Jean exclaimed.\n\n\"We both learned under Master Larks. We should have similarities in our cultivation,\" Markus affirmed with a measured nod.\n\n\"I don't see it,\" Al shook his head. \"I hoped that if you succeeded, you could help Jean in her cultivation as well. But it appears as though things have taken an unfortunate turn.\"\n\nMarkus scratched his chin in contemplation before proposing, \"Teacher Jeeves, can you please expand on what that is? How do our cultivations feel different?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-159]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":59,"$":{"0":{"v":"Volume 2 - Starting Anew","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy starts his new, new life at Twilight Village with his Disciple Markus and his family.","n":0.25}}},{"i":60,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 157 - (Interlude) Markus' Breakthrough","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n'Not this either,' Markus concluded with his eyes closed. He was currently sitting in a cross-legged posture in his room. He'd entered seclusion two weeks back and had effectively shut himself off from all outside communication. Markus could feel that he was at the cusp of a breakthrough. It was so close he could grab it, but it was yet to enter his reach. To bridge this gap, Markus considered a long-standing tradition amongst cultivators nearing advancement: Closed-Door Cultivation.\n\nUsually, the phrase closed-door is a placeholder implying isolation from all forms of intrusions and disturbances. It means to espouse an optimal environment for a cultivator to piece together scattered insights to develop new, more robust ones and as a result, achieve a breakthrough in their cultivation. It didn't necessitate foregoing nourishment as it was often counterproductive to the assimilation process.\n\nHowever, Markus wasn't having any of it! From his first steps into his arduous cultivation journey, Markus had realised one fact, which was that he wasn't gifted with talent. Every success he'd achieved was through gruelling effort and grinding. Only those gifted with genius-level comprehension skills, special physiques or bloodlines, monumental inheritances, or support from powerful structures like sects, clans and organisations could get away with the standard seclusion methods. He was not afforded that luxury.\n\nHence, Markus completely isolated himself from everything and delved deeper and deeper into his own thoughts. He could not afford to be distracted, so he started to forcefully slow down his metabolism and completely shut off most non-essential bodily functions, especially his senses. He then set up a thin layer of mana around his skin to reduce water wastage and slowed down his heart rate. He forcefully entered a comatose state where only his brain operated with its full functionality intact.\n\nThis technique should not be possible for a Mana Condensation realm mage who is yet to properly comprehend their body. However, thanks to Markus' Junior Sister and his Master's teachings, he was able to gain a better understanding of the human anatomy. Then, with collaborative experiments with his Junior Sister, Markus determined the extent of abuse he could put his body through before incurring horrible consequences.\n\nAfter reaching a state of complete isolation, Markus started to summarise his insights and planned his next steps. The reason he felt a breakthrough nearing, he concluded, most likely had to do with the fact that he was getting close to replicating Gaige's attack. That spell was the bottleneck to his advancement. However, Markus was also feeling conflicted. He had tried countless approaches to the spell, only to end up short in the last step. For every step taken, he ended up returning to where he started off from.\n\nMarkus determined that his dogged venture to create a contingency for his first public loss had been an exercise in futility. Was he wasting his time all along?\n\nBut upon aggregating everything he had learned till now in his comatose state, Markus came face to face with the sheer quantity of insights housed in his mind, all of which had been accumulated within a short span of two years. He WAS in fact wasting his time because he hadn't taken a step back to observe the problem with a broader lens. Now that he had done so, Markus zeroed in on the optimal solution to his bottleneck.\n\nHis inspiration was drawn from the way Marie achieved her breakthrough, and it had to do with how he perceived the world he lived in. When scientists conduct experiments, one of the things they need to determine is the variable or characteristic that they intend to measure or observe. One cannot start an experiment if they don't have a way to measure the results of changing the independent variable - how else can they gauge their efforts? His Master always said that the difference between science and random trial and error is proper observation and note-taking. Hence sensors, tools, and measuring equipment are an absolute prerequisite to any scientific endeavour.\n\nAll this time, Markus had been going about his \"experiments\" without this key ingredient. He had no way to measure the accuracy of his recreation of Gaige's attack. On that note, he had no gauge of Gaige's original attack to act as a basis for comparison. Hence Markus opted to use another basis that was familiar to him and vividly embedded into his memories: the vision of the black hole.\n\nOftentimes, Markus would reminisce about his observation of that unfathomable monstrosity during his meditation sessions. Interestingly, he could easily recollect every single detail. It was exactly like how a martial artist could retaliate against an attack through muscle memory alone.\n\nTherefore, Markus first started his closed-door cultivation by perfectly recreating his memory of the black hole. He wanted to relive it, deconstruct it down to the minutiae and figure out a more direct way to observe it without the use of his natural sensors. Markus figured that if he could achieve this goal, he could augment his spells further.\n\nThe high-gravity phenomenon formed in his mind gradually. Deprived of every other external distraction, the comatose Markus managed to essentially regress back to the time he was first dropped into the virtual reality experience. He started with the complete vision, and then from it, he incrementally deducted the inputs captured by his natural senses. As he expected, even without them, he could feel \"something\". It surprised him how his memories could grasp details that were beyond the limits of his senses, this wasn't naturally possible.\n\nWhen someone recollects a memory, the information is firmly tethered to key points captured by their senses. But in this case, Markus' memory reached realms bordering on extrasensory. He figured that it may be a quirk of his Master's special |Soul Imprint|. But this was good, he could now flex his mana senses to filter through different sensory data. Markus lacked the ability to abstract information in his mind like Marie, thus he could only brute force through the inputs in hopes of stumbling upon an answer.\n\nTwo weeks passed like that. Markus' mana senses would isolate a sensory bandwidth, apply it to the memory of the black hole and observe for any relevant inputs. Most of the time, he was unsuccessful. Once or twice, he managed to capture something faintly, but Markus did not pursue it further as his goal wasn't to follow a pointless tangent. Whatever he was looking for wouldn't be faint, it would blare at him!\n\n'This isn't it,' Markus repeated. 'Next one.'\n\nMarkus concentrated on his mana sense. Although he'd spent two whole weeks, he had barely scratched the surface of what his mana sense could capture. It was a frustrating process, but Markus took it in stride.\n\n'What's this?' Suddenly, Markus was bombarded with a rush of data through his mana sense. 'Was it a lucky break?'\n\nWith faint optimism, Markus tuned out all background noise and focused on the current bandwidth. As the surrounding static dissipated, he was confronted by a convoluted mess of data in an unintelligible raw form. Markus hypothesised that this may be what he'd been searching for. Now the only problem that remained was to decipher it, assimilate it, and apply it.\n\nSensing has a lot to do with how people perceive what is observed, and how they connect it to their reality. Just like how Marie viewed the waves of fate as literal signal waves, Markus pondered over how he could transpose this gibberish to something substantial and interpretable.\n\n'Gravity,' Markus thought to himself. 'What does it mean?' He repeated.\n\n'How does gravity affect the world?'\n\n'How can I visualise gravity?'\n\nMarkus traced back everything he'd learned up till now and started collating details on the theory of gravitation.\n\n'Gravity is a type of force. It is observed within a field that exists naturally around masses. Large masses have stronger fields, thus exert greater higher gravitational forces. But how do entities in a gravitational field know that they are in a field?' Markus proposed. To that, he recollected an overlooked explanation his Master proposed.\n\n\"Field-based forces are hard to conceptualise. But an apt analogy is to consider an infinitely stretched roll of cloth. On this cloth, you place a mass of some kind. What do you think will happen to the cloth?\" His Master asked. \"The cloth would dip where the mass is placed. Now, if you were to place a much, much smaller mass next to this larger mass in any close location. What will happen? This smaller mass will roll along the dip which is centred at the larger mass.\"\n\nAfter further discussion, Markus learned that this \"cloth\" could be referred to as spacetime. Or the representation of three-dimensional space as the singular dimension of time, in an abstract four-dimensional manifold. It took some mental gymnastics to wrangle this understanding since naturally, humans aren't able to visualise it. Humans live in a three-dimensional world, while the fourth dimension of time flows through us. To observe in four dimensions, we will need to know all states of a system at ALL points in time, all at one instance. Therefore, Markus simplified this 4D manifold into snapshots, where each snapshot in 3D space represents the state of the system in time.\n\nIncrementally, Markus started to apply this visualisation to the data his mana senses were capturing. He didn't have the same capacity to abstract as Marie, so he had to repeatedly conceptualise, deconstruct and reinforce the representation. As he did so, in his mind, a vague meshgrid started to materialise.\n\nThe meshgrid extended infinitely in all three dimensions. Markus followed the faintly drawn lines demarcating the meshgrid as it approached the black hole. Right as it approached its proximity, Markus observed the most absurd interaction where the meshgrid literally warped in place. The warping was not only spatial but temporal as well. As in, with every new snapshot, there were discontinuities in the mesh which indicated that the region wasn't being updated at the same rate as the rest of the mesh. This tearing became more egregious the further Markus approached the black hole.\n\n'This is it!' Markus exclaimed internally. Almost instantaneously, Markus released the holds on his bodily function, letting the mana flow freely through his channels. As he did so, a massive influx of mana activated from the surroundings towards his core. A whirlwind of mana formed above his body, which was regaining its functions, and rushed in through his mana channels. His nascent, gaseous, core started to settle and adorn a liquid state while dark steam of waste ejected through his pores.\n\nMarkus was partially unaware of this because he was preoccupied with applying his new technique. He activated the meshgrid through his mana sense and overlaid it on his regular vision. Unlike in front of the black hole, there weren't any warping regions this time. The grid was fairly consistent, barring a small dip centred on him.\n\nAn imperceptible explosion of insights occurred in Markus' mind as everything started to fall into place. His eyes widened and sparkled as he entered an inspired state at the zenith of his breakthrough. With a familiar motion, Markus reached forward with both hands and grabbed the abstract meshgrid as seen though in his senses and pushed it outwards.\n\nAs he did so, a sudden sense of weightlessness assaulted him. It was completely in contrast to what he felt when under the influence of Gaige's spell or the black hole. It was as if every fibre of his body had suddenly lost a percentage of its mass. Markus' body accelerated off the ground as the momentary difference of force acting on him and by him resulted in a net force upwards.\n\n\"Woah!\" Markus exclaimed in surprise. The minor distraction dissipated his inspired state. By this time, his advancement had settled as well. However, because of the momentary lapse, Markus' levitation was destabilised, causing him to fall face-first into the ground.\n\nHe tried to control his fall with his arms, but they refused to budge. Evidently, his weeks of hibernation without sustenance and movement had caused his muscles to atrophy lightly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Markus exclaimed. \"Help!\" He called out weakly. He cleared his hoarse throat and cried out again, \"Help!\"\n\nHelpless, Markus decided to try out Mana Transmission through his increased mana sensory range and caught his Junior Sister nearby. \"Jean! Please, help me.\"\n\nThrough his amplified sense, he could hear hurried footsteps approaching him.\n\n\"Senior Brother?\" Jean's flat voice called faintly. \"Did you call?\"\n\n\"I need help,\" Markus uttered.\n\nJean tried pushing the door open, only to face resistance. \"Umm, it's locked.\"\n\n\"Just burst through. I will fix it later.\"\n\n\"Matron Reva will get mad,\" Jean warned.\n\n\"It's fine, I will take the blame.\"\n\n\"Do you promise?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Please, help.\"\n\nWith an apprehensive push, Jean forced open the door.\n\n\"Senior Brother!\" Jean exclaimed as she hurriedly closed her eyes. Markus observed a crimson shade blooming across her face. The girl turned around abruptly and ran away.\n\n\"Jean!\" Markus screamed. \"Where are you going?\"\n\nAt that moment, Dora happened to pass by and peeked in.\n\n\"Ewww!\" The little girl exclaimed. \"Big Brother, why are you naked?\"\n\nShe then grasped her nose in disgust before adding, \"And you stink!\"\n\nThe girl giggled loudly and ran away, leaving Markus splayed on the floor with his bare bottom exposed.\n\n\"Help me...\" Markus whined as tears of shame descended his cheeks.\n\n\"You naughty boy!\" Matron Reva's voice bellowed from the distance. \"I oughta spank you! How could you traumatise your sisters like that?\"\n\n\"Help me...\" Markus whimpered, as the despair of having to experience Matron Reva's corporal punishment dawned on him.\n\n\"Hehehehe,\" a sly chuckle echoed in his ears. \"This oughta be good,\" Marie mocked from outside his room. She was clearly enjoying seeing Markus' predicament.\n\n\"Help me...\" Markus sighed. \"Please...\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-3.chapter-158]]","n":0.021}}},{"i":61,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 156 - Starting Anew","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nPart of the reason why Guy succumbed to the other Guy's attack was that he had truly given up. His reality was crumbling before him, shattered like a fragile mirror revealing the truth that he had tried to bury in his subconscious. Did he grossly overestimate his influence on the lives of his students in his past life?\n\nIt was totally possible. The death of Mahima, her younger sister and her mother was a heavy stone bearing down on Guy's heart. Even though his work had changed the lives of far more children across the world, no amount of charity could counterbalance the weight of those three lives. One could liken the tapestry woven by the experiences of one's life to the cryptic blockchain that had sprouted off back on Earth during Guy's later years. Every action and reaction, both intentional and unintentional, leaves a mark - a notch - in this tapestry that will remain as such for eternity. You can forget that it existed, and cover it up with intricate designs and folds or stitches, but the mark will remain there forever. It cannot be washed, it cannot be fixed, and it cannot be changed in any way.\n\nFor Guy, the death of those three was a garish tear in his tapestry. After years worth of sessions with his therapist, Guy had rationalised the existence of this tear. He accepted the fact that he couldn't have done anything in that situation. But as the other Guy pointed out, was that the whole truth? Was he really as powerless as he convinced himself to be?\n\nCould he have approached his previous life differently?\n\nThe sound of a baby's cry pierced through the suppressive silence prevailing around Guy's isolated consciousness. It cut through the barrier formed by the invading poisonous mist that attacked his soul, threatening to absorb and convert it. It hit right as Guy was about to lose his sense of self - as his identity was about to be absorbed by the other Guy.\n\nAt that moment of brief clarity, Guy realised a key fact. The person he was facing, the other Guy, was an entity originally created to manipulate others. At a point where Guy was forced to put on a facade to convince others, he had formed the other Guy by accident. The entity always teetered at the edge of the truth and doled out falsehoods like a faulty machinegun. Ironically, Guy had become victim to the huckster of his own subconscious design. Looking back at everything this entity foisted on him, Guy realised the sheer hypocrisy and fatalistic ethics it fostered. Although a lot of what the other Guy revealed was correct, there were twists that pushed it towards mistruths. It was so convincing that it had even brought him to the point of questioning his own existence and morals. He couldn't let such a monster loose into this world!\n\nLike a fresh injection of adrenaline, Guy's diminished strength was invigorated. With a hard yank, Guy pulled off the solid object masking his face. It ripped out with an audible tear sending a shockwave of excruciating pain down every nerve in his body. He felt as if he was being skinned alive and dragged through a sea of salt.\n\nAnd then, with an audible clang resonating with a morbid reverberation, a void-black mask dropped to the floor of the RoK. As Guy rubbed his eyes, he noticed a mist dissipating around him slowly. He recognised this fog, it was the same one he saw upon his first |Introspect| into his core. As the translucent vapour around him siphoned away, a sound echoed in his mind.\n\n'Next time, there won't be a concession.'\n\nGuy was about to swear audibly that he would never wear the mask again, but his thoughts were interrupted by the same voice.\n\n'You need me, Guy. We WILL meet again, I promise you.' After a pause, it continued. 'However, till our next reunion, I will offer you a word of advice considering that we are, after all, the same physical entity.'\n\n'To lie effectively, one needs to be intimate with the truth. You must be aware of that already,' the voice began. 'My mastery over the truth has reached a level where I can easily weave in even outrageous lies without arousing doubt.'\n\n'On that note, the reason for your death back on Earth may not necessarily be a complete truth,' the voice cautioned. 'Excessive charity work leading to a self-inflicted death caused by over-accumulation of negative luck. If that is how the world worked, it would have fallen apart from the very beginning.'\n\n'But Mast wouldn't lie to me...'\n\n'Wouldn't he?' the voice mocked. 'You're far too trusting. Forget it! I have no time for your naïveté. Just make sure that your body remains in one piece the next time we congregate. I don't want a broken vessel! The prophet of the Absolute Truth must be pristine and unaffected.'\n\nWith that, the voice faded away with the fog.\n\n(You were gone a long time there. I couldn't get to you. I was concerned,) a monotonous voice commented, originating from behind Guy.\n\nMast observed the awkward and conflicted expression drawn across Guy's face and approached him. (What's wrong?)\n\n'No- Nothing,' Guy said while shaking his head.\n\n(You've advanced into the External stage of Foundation Establishment. Congratulations.)\n\n'Thanks,' Guy answered with a blank tone. 'I should go now.'\n\nWith a curt salutation, Guy exited the RoK. After his departure, Mast's usually frigid face displayed a crack. His eyes narrowed as they focused on the rapidly receding mist. It snaked like a sentient creature through the air and exited through a nearly imperceptible tear in space. At the centre of the RoK, beneath the table where the mask was placed, a dark crack had formed.\n\n(This anomaly is getting out of hand,) Mast muttered. (This needs to be investigated before it barrels out of control and threatens the integrity of this plane.)\n\n____\n\nJean instructed Josie to place the child on a clean stack of towels and cover it well with a blanket. Following standard procedure, the baby would be cleansed and treated for any illnesses.\n\n\"Before touching the baby, make sure that you have thoroughly cleansed yourself with soap,\" Jean warned the excited midwife and mother. \"At this stage, the child is extremely susceptible to illnesses.\"\n\nChiani held pulled back her arms immediately. Observing the efficiency with which Jean restitched her eviscerated womb back together had raised her evaluation of the girl to extraordinary realms. At this point, Chiani was willing to accept every word spouted by Jean as gospel.\n\n\"As for you,\" Jean spoke directly to the mother. \"Do not move around excessively. Proper bed rest and medication are mandatory. You should know that the operation is highly experimental at this stage. You are the first person to undergo it, and therefore you will be under strict observation by both myself and Josie here.\"\n\nJosie nodded lightly as affirmation.\n\n\"C-Can I meet my husband?\" Chiani asked hesitantly.\n\n\"Chiani?!\" On queue, her agitated husband burst into the room and frantically searched around for his wife. \"Chiani!\"\n\nHe rushed forward, prepared to pull his exhausted wife into a tight embrace. But his leap was interjected by Josie, who pulled him up by the back of his collar.\n\n\"Be conscious of your wife's health!\" She reprimanded while nudging her eyes towards the exposed stitch line snaking below Chiani's belly.\n\n\"W-What happened?\"\n\n\"The procedure was successful,\" Jean explained. \"We've managed to extract the baby boy,\" she said while pointing at the wrapped baby.\n\nThe man collapsed to his knees and crawled towards the baby apprehensively. A myriad of warm emotions surfaced on his face as tears gushed out of his eyes. With quivering lips, he leaned over the baby. He consciously held his arms back, afraid that any sudden movements might hurt the precious bundle.\n\n\"My boy,\" he muttered. \"My star.\"\n\nChiani reached towards her shuddering husband with a similarly shuddering and weak arm. She held the man's hand with as much energy she could muster.\n\n\"He's our star,\" she said.\n\n\"That's right!\" The mean agreed. \"Our Star.\"\n\nThis emotional display was what Guy was exposed to upon returning to reality. Amidst the hustle and bustle, Guy receded from the room. His face and gaze were blank and monotone. With robotic steps, he weaved through the village while avoiding social interactions, and returned to his room in the orphanage. His mind wasn't preoccupied with that near-death experience against the other Guy. While the fear lingered at the back of his mind, his thoughts were wholly concerned with the points the other Guy raised while attempting his hostile takeover.\n\nAmidst all those lies, one truth stood out to Guy. Even in his past life, Guy had been excessively passive in his endeavours. He was satisfied with influencing changes at a slow and steady pace. But Guy recognised the futility of these ventures in the long run.\n\n'Although disruption leads to an imminent backlash, it is the one that leaves the longest lasting effects.' People are naturally averse to changes, even if they feel that their current trajectory will lead to stagnation or decline. In such a trajectory, minor nudges won't cause any noticeable shifts.\n\n'I should have come at it with a heavier fist,\" Guy concluded. 'Maybe I would have been perceived as the bad guy. But I would have helped a lot more people down the line.'\n\nAnd that led Guy to his current conclusion. 'I cannot live this life as passively as my last one. I was given a second chance, I should exploit it to explore a different lifestyle. This fruitless restart has gone long enough.'\n\nGuy exhaled loudly, releasing a metaphorical knot from his soul. \"It is time to make a new start. A better start!\" He said out loud.\n\n\"But before that,\" Guy stopped himself.\n\n'Mast,' Guy called out. 'We have a lot to discuss.'\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-157]]\n","n":0.025}}},{"i":62,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 155 - Conversations with the Other Guy","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\n'Do you enjoy living a passive life?' The other Guy mocked. 'Rolling with the flow, avoiding conflicts, living a life devoid of meaning. A negligible existence.'\n\nGuy remained stoic at the barrage of criticisms.\n\n'You don't deserve this second opportunity. You don't deserve The Church. MY CHURCH!' The other Guy continued. 'Look at what you've accomplished with its power? Absolutely nothing!'\n\n'I've assisted my students-' Guy pointed out, however, he was immediately interrupted by his counterpart.\n\n'Have you?!' The other Guy jabbed. 'You were handed a supercomputer capable of mapping stars, yet you use it to perform trivial arithmetic. You've barely scratched the surface; there is so much more to the extent of The Church's power. Does it satisfy you to wander near the periphery?'\n\n'I'm trying-'\n\n'You're surviving, when you could be thriving. This is the kind of person you are, weak-willed, submissive, compromising.'\n\n'I am not like that,' Guy tried to rebuke weakly.\n\n'Aren't you? Look back at your life. Not just this one, but the one before,' the other Guy urged. 'Given all that you've done, have you achieved anything substantial?'\n\n'I have!' Guy responded. 'Our work has positively affected so many people across the world.'\n\n'You tried to curb the flow of the river with a dam when you could have rerouted it entirely,' the other Guy commented. 'You were the son of one of the most powerful families in the entire world. You could lobby for substantial change on a global scale. However, you were unwilling to square up against parties that opposed your agenda to bring about this positive change. You were unwilling to put your foot down and demand a revolution. You compromised, Guy!'\n\n'That was the best way. Introducing disruptive change to a foreign environment isn't long-lasting and sustainable. And if the local government and organisations oppose the changes, there is little guarantee that they will be propagated,' Guy reasoned. 'I had to take a gentle approach.'\n\n'What do you think happened after your departure?' The other Guy sighed. 'Just like water flows from high to low, the places you left after introducing your non-disruptive change most likely reverted to their old ways.'\n\n'You're saying that I should have been more imposing?' Guy retorted. 'Enforce my so-called \"revolutionary\" and \"right\" views to the culturally diverse places I visited? How different would I be from the colonists of the past who did the same and devastated the indigenous and blooming societies? It isn't right to foist my values upon a society that nurtures another set of values.'\n\n'Those that cannot adapt to change must succumb,' the other Guy highlighted with a disdainful sneer. 'That is one of the Absolute Truths of the world that has sustained through millennia. It is what caused the extinction of dinosaurs, and pushed humans from one of the weakest to the most dominant species on the planet. These people that you talk about cling to the old ways mired in falsehoods and lies, wasn't it your responsibility as the enlightened to disperse this treacherous fog?!'\n\n'At the cost of losing their heritage and traditions?' Guy retaliated. 'I don't think so.'\n\nThe other Guy walked over to the family of three, frozen in greyscale, and nudged his chin towards them, 'What about them? You promised that you would save them, didn't you? You promised to help them live a better life. What of it? Aren't they also victims of the so-called \"traditions\" you're so desperately trying to preserve?'\n\n'They...'\n\n'THEY ALL DIED!' The other Guy bellowed. 'Borne in an environment where women are viewed as inferior, meant to serve men, what did you expect would happen? Your attempt to bring in law and order through the established systems accomplished nothing. The wife died the day after the surgery due to accumulated internal injuries from years of withstanding domestic abuse and lack of proper healthcare in such a remote region. Left with no other guardian, the young girl was sequestered with her abusive father who killed her in a fit of drunken rage. The baby girl was then drowned in the river, killed within weeks of birth.'\n\n'It is the result of a regressed mentality. An exception rather than the rule,' Guy tried to argue without conviction. \n\n'Are you trying to justify the death of three innocents?' the other Guy retorted in disbelief.\n\n'No! I...'\n\n'Take a look at yourself!' The other Guy scolded.\n\n'But the man was punished by the full extent of the law.' Guy flinched lightly as he finished that statement. The other Guy had unearthed a memory that he had forcefully suppressed a long time back. Although he had promised Grace to protect the girls and their mother, ultimately he had failed to uphold it. Multiple factors contributed to this failure, most if not all had to do with the remoteness of the village and the scarcity of proper law enforcement channels that let the abusive husband and father slip through the cracks.\n\nBack then, Guy felt completely useless and weak. His conscience attacked him constantly, and to remedy it he had thrown himself into charity work like a possessed individual. But all that distraction could not revert a loss of life.\n\n'You see! You recognise the kind of failure you are,' the other Guy mocked.\n\n'What could I have done differently?' Guy said in defeat.\n\n'Grow a spine!' the other Guy egged. 'Flex your influence. Implement changes on a global scale. If people don't succumb, then bear down on them with the full extent of your power.'\n\n'That's... immoral,' Guy muttered while shaking his head.\n\n'Lies, deceit, treachery, bribery, racketeering, felony, homicide and so on, if performed in pursuit of the Truth, the Absolute Truth, do not count as immoral as they are ultimately for the betterment of the world,' the other Guy recited piously.\n\n'What?!'\n\n'If you want the world to bend, you cannot coax it. You must grab it by the ends and force it to bend,' the other Guy expounded. 'It is acceptable to lie if the goal is to enlighten the ignorant masses to the Truth. Should certain interlopers resist against the Absolute Truth, it is morally acceptable to purge them, after all, we cannot let a few rotten apples spoil the bunch.'\n\n'You're a monster!'\n\n'Compare me with a man who killed his daughters and sent his wife to her death with his own hands, and THEN felt absolutely no remorse over those actions. Who's worse?'\n\n'Nonetheless, I couldn't have done any of what you said back on Earth,' Guy shook his head immediately. 'I couldn't have killed that man, not could I have let Grace do it. It is illegal and against basic human rights.'\n\n'Ah,' the other Guy exclaimed. 'But that was back on Earth. Those rules don't apply here, do they?'\n\n'What are you saying?'\n\n'This world is primitive and backwards. Its people are blind to the Absolute Truth of the World. You've carefully holed yourself up in this small corner, safe from the madness that lurks in the distance. Are you feeling good right now?' The other Guy mocked.\n\n'I-'\n\n'This world is a hundred times worse than Earth. Class dichotomies, martial segregation, death, destruction, false rituals and superstitions, famines, droughts and disease. This world is in dire need of enlightenment, you know it, I know it. Do you feel comfortable sitting here in a bed of flowers, while others - children - are suffering the unspeakable horrors of society?'\n\n'No, but-'\n\n'We must spread the Absolute Truth! We need to push ourselves, grow stronger, and save this world from itself. We have the tools - The Church. We must use it to its maximum capacity to break through cultivation realms. We must grow our flock!'\n\nAs the other Guy started orating with crescendoing vigour and fervour, an encroaching, parasitic sentiment slithered into Guy's mind. It started as a gnawing sensation, slowly decaying parts of his consciousness.\n\n'The only way to raise this world from its stagnant state is by raising the suppressed masses and revealing the Truths of the world to them. We need to espouse free thinkers, inventors and artists. We need to eradicate all the lies that poison the mind of the common folk. We must exert our influence until the world is reborn, stronger, and more adaptive than it ever was before.'\n\nThe parasite branched out exponentially, attempting to consume every mote of his consciousness, cleansing it and turning it into a corrupted sentience\n\n'We aren't shackled by poorly implemented laws and regulations. If we have the power, we can cleanse those that fail to adapt to the rapidly changing world, because that would be the right thing to do.'\n\n'SHUT UP!' Guy bellowed. 'You're a maniac! A fanatic of the highest order! Do you not see the inhumanity in your proposition? You're encouraging mass genocide of those that fail to accept your truth-'\n\n'Not MY Truth, THE Truth. The Absolute Truth,' the other Guy interjected with gritting teeth. 'And of course! I've justified why such measures are completely within moral limits.'\n\n'But you said the Truth is never guaranteed to remain static. That is Science!'\n\n'That is correct and incorrect. The Truth isn't a word, phrase, or scripture. It is a frame of mind. To be able to freely debate, evaluate and modulate one's belief based on proper reasoning and thoroughly supported processes and data. THAT is The Absolute Truth. After all, no single fact can remain true all the time in perpetuity, thus everything must be permitted in search of verifying what is the truth at any given point in time.'\n\nThe other Guy paused before accentuating, 'Don't lose track of our goal. Our aim is the same: to create a goal where no person has to worry about losing their loved ones for reasons apart from natural causes. Neither of us wants to see another baby or child dying a premature death. This vessel has such potential, yet it is wasted on a man such as yourself.'\n\nThe parasite which had encroached into a large portion of Guy's consciousness activated all at one, stabbing into his sense of self. Guy crumbled under the multi-faceted attack and grasped his in pain.\n\n'Get out of my head!'\n\n'You should just give up. You failed in your first life, let me handle this one. I can accomplish so much more with your body.'\n\nGuy grunted while clutching the sides of his face. He plunged his nails into his skin and latched onto a hard metallic surface.\n\n'GET! OUT!'\n\nGuy tugged frantically. He was slowly losing his consciousness and sense of self. Thoughts of bloody crusades to spread the Absolute Truth and save the ignorant masses from the dangers of ignorance started sprouting in his mind.\n\n'STOP!'\n\n'Give up.'\n\nGuy's consciousness started to fade slowly. His sentience was dissipating. His hard-earned second life was on the verge of cessation.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-156]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":63,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 154 - Artificial Childbirth","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Do you have the solution prepared, Josie?\" Jean directed at Josie who had entered her assistant-state-of-mind.\n\n\"As you had instructed, Young Miss,\" Josie responded as she pulled out a metal sealed container to Jean. \"I haven't tested it properly yet, unfortunately. However initial trials showed that it works as described.\"\n\nJean nodded affirmatively and instructed the midwife, \"Please close all windows and portals into the room. We will be sanitising the area and cannot allow any foreign contaminants.\"\n\nThe midwife acted accordingly, all the while sporting a confused expression. Once the windows were closed shut and locked tightly, Jean jerked her head lightly in Josie's direction who immediately cast a spell circle encircling the metal container.\n\n|Disperse|\n\nA thin mist started to emanate from the container as the spell circle rotated at a steady rate, dissipating into the environment.\n\n\"It smells pleasant,\" the midwife commented. \"Is this a perfume?\"\n\nJean pulled her brows upward inquisitively and frowned.\n\n\"This slave took the liberty of adding an inert fragrant agent to the mixture, Young Miss,\" Josie clarified immediately. \"A thousand apologies for that, however, the solution was extremely pungent. This slave assumed that the mixture would be aerosolised as a mist therefore she took the subsequent measures. But rest assured that the efficacy of the solution was not affected.\"\n\n\"I can see that,\" Jean responded with a nod. Her mana sense observed her immediate vicinity and noticed that the aerosol was working as expected and killing the malicious germs. \"Good job, Josie!\"\n\n\"Miss Lane,\" Jean spoke to her patient. \"We will start by administering an anaesthetic. Please try to sit up.\"\n\nThe woman hummed with a strained voice and sat up with assistance from the midwife.\n\n\"Josie, proceed with the injection,\" Jean commanded.\n\nJosie channelled her mana and created a translucent sphere around the phial containing the Sleep Pollen in her hand. She carefully undid the seal and extracted a fingernail-sized amount with practised efficiency. She closed the seal on the phial and directed her complete attention to the suspended powder. Another two spell circles activated subsequently and engulfed the powder, causing it to undergo a substantial change which turned it transparent. Josie retrieved another phial containing a dark-brown solvent and introduced it to the powder, then swirled the blob rapidly with her mana causing it to assume a translucent, golden shade. The blob of solution, sustained in the air with mana, was transported towards the pregnant woman's exposed backside.\n\n\"There will be a slight sting, please cooperate,\" Josie said before she tapped the skin above the woman's spine with her illuminated fingers. An imperceptible hole formed in that region, which Josie used to inject the solution.\n\n\"It needs to be sent directly into the space within the spine protecting the spinal cord,\" Jean reminded. \"Do not let it disperse in the muscle or the blood vessels.\"\n\n\"Worry not, Young Miss,\" Josie responded. \"This slave will be careful.\"\n\nImmediately after, Josie pressed her open palms along the woman's back and rubbed lightly over the spine. As she did so, an ethereal glow bloomed in the affected region, as though a light was shining from inside the woman's body.\n\nWhen mortals transcend as mages through cultivation, they gain greater control over the flow of mana within the channels in their bodies. The greater one's control, the easier it becomes for them to manage their involuntary bodily processes. Absorption of medicine is one of these factors that is affected by advancements in cultivation. Usually, when a mortal takes some medicine, the effect of the medicine is delayed based on the mode of administration. One can expect quick action with intravenous ingestion, however, there is a gap between when the medicine is introduced and when the expected result is observed. Mages can bypass this biological limitation by nudging their mana channels to motivate greater blood flow, metabolism, and so on.\n\nJosie was currently mimicking this process by activating the lethargic mana flowing inside Chiani Lane's dormant mana channels, and amplifying the rate at which the drug's active components adhered to the nerve endings. This procedure was common in the field of medicine in the world, however, this did not mean that it was trivial in any way. Every person has a different arrangement of mana channels of different sizes, shapes and orientations. Furthermore, each drug needs to be administered and must affect different organs and parts of the body. These factors, including a few others that come into play given special constitutions and bloodlines, amplify the difficulty of this procedure. Learning artificial stimulation can take years, if not decades, to master. Due to the inherently variable nature of this science, it is only possible to properly learn it through practice and application.\n\nTo that end, artificial stimulation also has a high chance of backfiring on the patient. Introducing foreign mana into another body and manipulating its mana channels can lead to backlash if it is not managed properly and with care.\n\nArtificial stimulation is an often underappreciated and overlooked field of medicine for this very reason. For one, most physicians that are mages, cater treatment specifically for other mages. In this instance, there is little need for the physician to stimulate absorption, since the patient should have the capacity to stimulate their own organs. After all, why take the risk of accidentally hurting a patient if they can manage a task themselves? Thus, artificial stimulation often becomes obsolete when dealing with patients in higher cultivation realms. On a side note, it is generally believed that a mage that has lost their ability to manipulate their bodily functions using their mana is as good as dead.\n\nSo, by order of elimination, artificial stimulation mainly finds use amongst the mortal populace. Most, if not all, mage physicians tend to avoid treating mortals. Primarily, they believe it is beneath them, and secondly, they feel that treating mortals is inconsequential. Mortals die all the time, why waste energy trying to save another measly life that has no effect on the world?\n\nJean's mother did not share this point of view. However, since mastering artificial stimulation requires a heavy investment of time, she opted to offload the task to her assistant, Josie.\n\n\"I-\" Chiani muttered in confusion. \"I can't feel anything?\"\n\n\"It's in effect,\" Josie added. \"We can begin now, Young Miss.\"\n\n\"No one touches the patient with anything that is NOT first sanitised or coated with a layer of pure mana,\" Jean reminded.\n\nJean let the pregnant woman rest back on the mattress and placed her mana-coated palms over the woman's exposed belly. Jean extended her mana sense through her palms, piercing the belly, and into the womb. She thoroughly inspected the foetus' situation and commented, \"We will be making an incision along this direction.\"\n\nJean moved her finger horizontally in a region below the belly button and above the hip line. \"Take note of the blood vessels traversing this region. The cut should avoid them. Keep a spell handy to suck out the blood just in case.\"\n\n\"Why don't we cauterise the blood vessel?\" Josie suggested.\n\n\"I cannot risk causing necrosis,\" Jean replied. \"We will suture the vessels together after the operation is completed.\"\n\n\"I have prepared a blood stimulating lozenge for this purpose, Young Miss,\" Josie said. She retrieved a dark red, coin-sized solid object and stuffed it into Chiani's mouth. \"Suck on it. It will provide a slow influx of vitality.\"\n\nThe dumbfounded woman nodded innocently and sucked on the salty mass in her mouth.\n\nJean exhaled loudly to calm her nerves a final time before extending her index and middle finger out. She started to circulate her mana rapidly, concentrating it at her fingertips. She then brought her fingers close to the belly and dipped them in.\n\nAs though she were slicing butter, the nails of her fingers dipped in and separated the flesh. This elicited an audible gasp from both the midwife and the numb Chiani.\n\n\"Why can't I feel that?!\" Chiani exclaimed.\n\n\"Please calm down,\" Josie repeated. \"The anaesthetic affects your nerves and inhibits any pain response.\"\n\n\"This is really freaky,\" the midwife muttered while gulping loudly. She then noticed Jean sweating heavily as her eyes concentrated while affixed on the incised region. By instinct, the midwife reached for a towel and lightly dabbed the girl's forehead.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Jean said without diverting her attention and repeated the cut, but with greater depth.\n\n____\n\n\"What a beautiful girl!\" Grace cooed while leaning into the newborn's crib.\n\n\"Can I carry?\" Mahima asked from beside her, trying her hardest to look into the crib while standing on her toe tips.\n\n\"It's not safe,\" Grace answered. \\``She could get sick. Wait until the doctors allow us, okay?\\``\n\nThe girl nodded her head reluctantly and rushed towards the bed close by to meet her mother.\n\n\"We can't let them suffer through this again, Guy,\" Grace said with conviction.\n\n\"We won't let that happen,\" Guy reaffirmed. His eyes then scanned over the fragile yet harmonious sight before him.\n\n'One mustn't make promises they cannot keep,' an eerie voice scoffed from within Guy's mind. As it pierced through his consciousness, the area around Guy froze in place and lost all colour, assuming a drab grey hue.\n\n'You made that declaration so boldly, with such confidence,' the voice berated. 'What did it amount to? Zilch!'\n\nWith a rage-filled bellow, the voice accentuated, 'The mother, her child, and her newborn baby - you let them all die, you weak, spineless man!'\n\n'W-Who?'\n\nAs the words escaped Guy's mouth, the area in front of him rippled slightly. From the centre of the ripple, a figure stepped out. It was a man, dressed in a plain robe with a pastel colour palette that emitted an almost divine aura. He had an olive-brown skin tone with unkempt hair, his height and build were average. In fact, he appeared unassuming in every sense of the word, but Guy could not avert his eyes from him.\n\nGuy's eyes settled on the man's face, and then immediately widened in shock. He had seen this face before! In fact, he'd been seeing this face in the mirror for at least a year now.\n\n'Y-You are-'\n\n'You.' The man completed Guy's sentence.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-155]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":64,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 153 - Baggage","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\"Everyone apart from Josie, please leave the room immediately!\" Jean commanded authoritatively. \"Oh! And please call the midwife in again.\"\n\n\"Umm, Young Miss,\" Josie interrupted. \"Teacher Larks is in a crucial state at the moment.\"\n\nJean followed Josie's extended finger and saw her Teacher seated in a meditative state in a cross-legged pose. \"Is Teacher having a breakthrough?\"\n\n\"It is progressing at a steady but unwavering pace. Teacher Larks appears close to breaking into the External Stage, and at this rate, it will eventually be achieved,\" Josie corrected. \"And I believe that it isn't just Teacher Larks' cultivation, but also his spirituality that is undergoing a form of breakthrough. This slave believes that it is risky to interrupt during this process.\"\n\nJean pursed her lips and nodded contemplatively. \"Nonetheless, everyone else must evacuate.\"\n\n\"By the way, Josie,\" Jean added immediately after. \"Do we happen to have any strong sedatives, preferably ones that target the spine?\"\n\nJosie shook her head apologetically and answered, \"The ones I'm carrying are far too toxic for a mortal human, I'm afraid. This slave wouldn't recommend it even after dilution.\"\n\nJean scratched her forehead in frustration. \"That is suboptimal...\"\n\n\"Umm, Medium Sis?\" Dora called out meekly.\n\n\"Dora!\" Jean exclaimed. \"What are you still doing here? Quick, go, go!\"\n\n\"Actually...\" Dora reached into her satchel and pulled out a small phial. \"Do you think this will help?\"\n\n\"What is that?\" Jean approached with furrowed brows.\n\n\"Insect Queen Sleep Pollen!\" Josie exclaimed. \"Where did you get that?!\"\n\n\"What?\" Jean blurted out in shock. \"Dora, where did you find this?\"\n\nDora lowered her head and twisted her feet in distress, \"Umm...\"\n\n\"Leave it,\" Jean sighed, noticing the girl's discomfort. \"Thank you for this, it's perfect. The Sleep Pollen of an Insect Queen contains a toxin that targets the nerves extending from the inhaler's spine. As long as we can control the dosage, it should offer the perfect sedative effect for our patient without adversely affecting the foetus, right Josie?\"\n\n\"That is correct, Young Miss,\" Josie affirmed.\n\n\"Be that as it may, we will get back to this conversation afterwards, Dora,\" Jean warned sternly.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Marie chimed in with a frown.\n\n\"An Insect Queen in an extremely deadly beast. Although it isn't as physically monstrous as most other species, its strength is derived through its sentience and perceptivity that matches - if not exceeds - most adult humans. I won't exhaust you with the details, but a single Insect Queen, if allowed to grow and accumulate sufficient pollen, can eradicate an entire city without raising a single alert,\" Jean explained. \"This pollen could put Dora into an endless sleep if she had ingested even a pinch.\"\n\n\"Dora!\" Marie screamed.\n\n\"Please,\" Jean interjected. \"Take this outside. We cannot afford to be distracted here.\"\n\nMarie nodded and led Dora and the patient's husband outside.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Jean called out to the midwife who was trying her hardest to make herself scarce.\n\n\"I-\" The midwife stuttered. \"This one believes she isn't needed here, right?\" She reasoned while sweating bullets. Things had moved beyond her realm of understanding.\n\nAt that moment she recollected a key idiom her mother used to preach when she was younger: \"Trying to understand a mage's thoughts and actions is futile. If you try to understand it, you die, if you don't, you die.\" Back then, she had scoffed at her mother's cowardice and meek beliefs. It was only after personally experiencing it, that the midwife understood the deep meaning hidden in those seemingly bland words.\n\n'The longer I stay here, the higher my chances of dying,' she thought to herself. 'That emotionless girl is a rich Young Mistress, and the woman throwing murderous glares my way is probably her assigned protector. I managed to survive my first sleight thanks to the girl, I don't think a second one will fly here.'\n\n\"Of course, you are needed here,\" the girl said flatly. \"You are more experienced in assisting childbirth than either of us.\"\n\n\"But I don't have any knowledge about what the Young Mistress is preparing to perform,\" the midwife pleaded. \"This one feels that she will only be a hindrance.\"\n\n\"The Young Miss asked you to stay,\" Josie reinforced.\n\n\"This one is staying,\" the midwife nodded obediently and assumed a position close to the pregnant woman cautiously.\n\n\"First things first, we need to sanitise all work surfaces and tools,\" Jean instructed. \"Do as I say, Josie.\"\n\n____\n\nGrace growled audibly at the now barely sober man who was massaging his crotch with a disgruntled expression. The man tried to glare back at her, but could not withstand the vicious aura Grace exuded and, like a submissive beta wolf in the presence of the alpha, shrunk his head into his shoulder meekly. At that point, the man decided to target the weakest link, Mahima.\n\n\\``Come here, girl!\\`` The man commanded, causing the recipient to shakily retreat behind Grace.\n\n\\``I want you to try that again,\\`` Grace demanded with a forceful retort.\n\nThe man coughed and responded by saying, \\``That's my daughter. I'm allowed to talk to her however I want.\\``\n\nGrace leapt towards the man with gusto but was immediately held back by Guy.\n\n\"Grace, not now,\" Guy said with a frown.\n\n\"You're letting him get away with it?\" Grace shrieked back. \"Look at what he did to his wife!\"\n\n\"What do you plan to do? Mete out frontier justice?\" Guy reasoned. \"The world has laws, and we will move through the proper channels to ensure that he is prosecuted to its full extent.\"\n\nGrace clenched her fist and grit her teeth, all the while pulling the girl closer into an embrace.\n\n\"People like him don't deserve to live,\" Grace declared. \"They treat those that they consider beneath them as animals. They project their inadequacy onto them and unleash their pent-up frustration without reason.\"\n\n\"It's disgusting!\" She spat out. \"The worst part is that the victims are so badly affected both physically and mentally that they lose all ability to stand up against the offenders.\"\n\n\"Grace?\" Guy inquired with a concerned tone. \"What's wrong?\"\n\nGrace sighed loudly and uttered, \"Did you know that my father died because he choked on a peanut?\"\n\n\"Every night, after work, he would come home with a 6 pack of beer and a packet of roasted peanuts that a street vendor sold near his place of work. As he drank, he would pop the peanuts into his mouth with practised precision,\" Grace continued. \"Crunch! Crunch! Each nut consumed was like the ticking of a morbid clock - a dreaded countdown timer for my mother and me. Because we knew that when those peanuts ran out, his idle hands would seek something else.\"\n\n\"I was his go-to target to release his frustrations. He hated that I was smarter than him - more accomplished than him. The man barely graduated high school, hearing that his daughter had potential beyond him, he couldn't take it. He would accuse my mother of cheating on him and fooling him into raising a bastard. Of course, those accusations were accompanied by a battery of fresh beatings to highlight the point. Every day he would approach me with red eyes and slurred speech, spouting insults. My mother would redirect his anger, take on the brunt of the attack. Day after day.\"\n\n\"Until one day, my father missed. The peanut he tossed into his mouth, flew too far. It lodged itself perfectly in his windpipe,\" Grace paused as she stared blankly at Guy. \"My mother and I watched as the life faded from his eyes. As his face flushed a deadly red shade while struggling to catch even a mote of precious oxygen. As he clawed into his neck in an attempt to dislodge the rogue nut through his skin. At the very last moment, for the first time, my father showed genuine fear. He pleaded for us to save him.\"\n\n\"I could have saved him, Guy,\" Grace muttered with a wavering tone. \"But I didn't. I didn't want to.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" Guy comforted her while pulling her closer by her shoulders.\n\n\"No, it isn't, Guy!\" Grace exclaimed. \"My mother passed away a few months later - she killed herself. Couldn't handle the guilt. But I didn't feel anything, Guy. I didn't feel regret - no guilt. I didn't feel relief. I didn't feel anything!\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" Guy repeated.\n\n\"It was then that I realised that that man had taken something from me on the day he died. I know he did,\" Grace accentuated. \"Or maybe he took it before, and I was too accustomed to recognise it.\"\n\n\"I don't want her to go through it the same way I did,\" Grace declared while gesturing at Mahima. \"I am confident that I was one of the lucky ones. This girl can never be free of the man - not physically nor emotionally. Not unless we help her.\"\n\n\"We will help her,\" Guy affirmed. \"She won't have to suffer Grace. I will make sure of it.\"\n\nAt that moment, Dr Yagi stepped out of the tent and removed his mask.\n\n\"The procedure was successful, and the foetus was born without complications. The mother has regained consciousness and is recovering slowly. However we are still treating the other physical traumas ailing her,\" the man explained. \"She is currently with the newborn girl.\"\n\n\"Girl?\" Mahima's father blurted out, seemingly catching the key phrase in the doctor's explanation. He clicked his tongue and said, \\``Another money sink. That woman can't even birth a boy? Useless!\n\\``\n\nGrace rushed forward and threw the man to the ground over her shoulders.\n\n\"Grace, NO!\" Guy quickly intervened and pulled her away before she could descend upon the prone man.\n\n\"Dr Yagi, please call the authorities,\" Guy instructed.\n\n\"I've done that already. But the closest law enforcement office is quite a distance away. It will take time,\" Dr Yagi affirmed before re-entering the tent.\n\n\"Let's go check on the baby girl,\" Guy urged Grace and ushered her into the tent.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-154]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":65,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 152 - Point Of View","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nJean had experienced the effect of Teacher Larks' special |Soul Imprint| before, many times at that. And each time, she would be more and more impressed by its realism, efficacy, and breadth of coverage. Although Jean did not have another experience to act as a basis of comparison, she was confident that no other Mage could match her Teacher Larks' |Soul Imprint|. \n\nFrom what she heard from Uncle Jeeves and her father, a |Soul Imprint| seldom offers such vivid visions and extrasensory manifestations. It is, as its name suggests, an imprint of whatever information is being conveyed directly into the minds of the recipient. There was little room for exploration, discussion and evaluation. This was not how Teacher Larks' ability worked. Although it didn't have the same efficiency of data assimilation as the conventional |Soul Imprint|, it offered something else that was infinitely more conducive to learning, in Jean's opinion. Teacher Larks' technique forces the recipient to question what they're observing and derive conclusions through logical reasoning, given some guidance from the Teacher of course.\n\nThis method circumvents possible damages that could be incurred through the assimilation of conflicting or higher-dimensional insights. For instance, with the conventional |Soul Imprint|, if the imprinter conveys data that requires a paradigm shift from the recipient to understand it, there is a high possibility of the recipient undergoing a cultivation deviation. \n\nIt's like forcing a pig to comprehend the nature of flight. There are physical and mental limitations in a pig that make it impossible to fathom that concept. If one day someone were to imprint the method of flight directly into a pig's mind, the pig would undergo an identity crisis that would ultimately result in it falling to its demise from a steep cliff.\n\nOn the other hand, if the pig was made to methodically evaluate the concept of flight by observing different entities with that ability, breaking down the specifics into comprehensible chunks, and building upon its knowledge base incrementally, it could one day even lift itself off the ground and hover. After all, if gargantuan beings such as dragons, manticores and gryphons could soar through the skies, what was stopping pigs from doing the same?\n\nHence, the moment Jean felt an ethereal suction pulling her consciousness from reality, she figured that she was about to experience Teacher Larks' |Soul Imprint|. The circumstances of entry were rather abrupt, completely unlike what occurred during her previous trips, but Jean didn't dwell on it. Instead, she prepared herself for whatever visions she was about to be delivered by calming her mind and expanding its perceptivity to inputs. But then suddenly, everything started to veer off course in an unprecedented direction.\n\nJean felt as if all of her instincts and sensibilities were dialled up to eleven. She didn't even feel as if she was inside her own body. For one, she completely lost the link to her mana senses. She couldn't feel any mana at all! Not inside her, not around her... nowhere. The feeling was unsettling, it was like if someone were to remove a part of the body that is used regularly and involuntarily.\n\nAt that moment, Jean's remaining sensory organs started to gain clarity. Her sight, her sense of smell and hearing, the tactile receptors, they all initialised simultaneously and placed Jean in a room that looked nothing like anything she'd seen before. The room was being lit by an interesting contraption hanging off of the ceiling. The orb of bright white light was enclosed in a looping glass tube. The surrounding area looked less like a solid structure and more like a tent - a temporary fixture similar to the one Uncle Jeeves resided in every time he visited the Orphanage.\n\n'What kind of magic is this?' Jean wanted to speak out loud, however, her mouth did not follow her wishes. While frowning, albeit internally, Jean lowered her gaze and was welcomed by a morbid sight!\n\nA woman lay on a table in front of her, with a bulging stomach ready to burst. She was pale and in a nearly unconscious state. Her mouth moved rhythmically, emanating a light whisper of gibberish she could not understand.\n\n'Is she speaking another language?' That was a logical conclusion. Not only did the woman have a darker facial tone, unlike the usually olive-skinned folk within the Radiant Empire, she was also wearing a colourful cotton cloth draped over herself in a loop.\n\n\"Prep the patient.\" A voice escaped her mouth, one that sounded male.\n\n'Am I a man?' Jean looked at her hands and noticed that they were completely white and leathery. Right as shock threatened to take over, she realised that it was simply a layer of rubber. She also observed that she was wearing a green overall that covered the remainder of her body, similar to the others near her. Everyone was also wearing a facial cover, fluffy headgear covering their hair, and a transparent eye shield.\n\n'Is this to maintain sterility of the environment?' Jean hypothesised that these special gears may be an optimised attempt to isolate the work area from possible contaminants that may reside in the persons' bodies.\n\nAt that moment, someone near her - 'him' in this case - draped a similar green fabric over the woman on the table, revealing a cut-out window over her stomach. The fabric was then affixed in place.\n\n\"Administering anaesthetic.\" Another individual in the room, stationed near the woman's head, commented as they operated another arcane equipment. This device had a transparent tube extending out of it, opening up to a mouthpiece that covered the woman's mouth and nose.\n\n\"Scalpel,\" Jean instructed, receiving a thin cutting device in her open hand. And with that, the operation began.\n\nThroughout the process, Jean was simply an observer. Her senses were restricted by the body she was residing in, however, she was open to everything the body experienced.\n\nAt first, Jean was unsure of what she was observing. She felt like a fish out of water brought into a place completely unfamiliar to her own. Everything looked sleek and otherworldly and functioned in a way contrary to her sensibilities.\n\nTake the box-like device with a myriad of numeric and graphical data flashing across it, that emitted a rhythmic beeping sound. What was its purpose? Why was there someone reading out the data written on it and calling it out loud? What is Blood O2 level?\n\nMany such questions lingered in Jean's mind, however, she was quickly enamoured by the operation her body was performing. Every action was measured and mechanic - there was a proper structure to it. The person operating knew exactly what they were doing, and they had definitely performed it multiple times before. Not just that, even those accompanying the person operated with a rhythmic harmony. Every tool was prepared and clean and was handed aptly when asked for - sometimes even before it was called out. Frequently, they would count the tools, possibly to ensure that none were misplaced during the procedure.\n\n'The level of documentation and regulation...' Jean was thoroughly impressed.\n\nWhile she was lost in the beginning, Jean quickly recognised certain steps as they were described in her mother's journals. The existence of multiple membranous layers. The location of the incision. Everything lined up perfectly!\n\nAfter recognising these similarities, Jean's mind quickly started to walk back and cross-referenced the steps she'd seen before with her own knowledge, taking note of specific details that her mother's journals missed. At this point, Jean realised that whatever she was observing was years ahead of anything her mother had documented. This was the pinnacle of what her mother sought so ardently.\n\nHow did Teacher Larks know about this? What was this vision she was experiencing? Many questions like these started to boil over in her head. Suddenly, a realisation struck her.\n\n'Is this the True World Teacher Larks was talking about?' The enigmatic concept that Teacher Larks observed through his inheritance that spoke of a world without mana - the True World. This was it!\n\n'Once free of mana - the liar - the world that remains is the True World,' Jean repeated. It all made sense now. The reason why her mother hadn't achieved breakthroughs in a lot of her theories was that she had become mired in the falsehoods introduced by mana.\n\nMany incomplete and false theories circling in Jean's mind started to warp imperceptibly. Certain sections were truncated, others were expounded, some were erased, others were rewritten. Needless to say, Jean was experiencing a profound phenomenon that was pushing her beyond the limits of the Mana Condensation realm.\n\nFinally, the virtual experience reached the point where the child was extracted from the mother's womb through the incision. The baby's umbilical cord was cut, and the surgeon proceeded to stitch the womb together. Jean placed her complete focus on the process, taking care to not miss a single point.\n\nOnce the last knot was tied, Jean felt herself getting pulled out to the real world. Her virtual senses were clipped, and she could once again feel the mana circulating inside and around her. Upon realising that it was time for her departure, Jean was overcome with regret. She was barely able to absorb a fraction of what was presented to her. Although it did help close most of the holes in her understanding, she felt unfulfilled after knowing that there was still more to the topic than she had realised. Furthermore, Jean didn't know what happened to the woman; did she survive after the ordeal? Before she was extracted out of the experience, Jean could still hear the faint beeping noise in the background. Hopefully, the woman survived. But she could already see that the woman had lost a lot of blood...\n\nNonetheless, although it felt like a lot of time had passed in the virtual experience, in actuality it had taken barely five minutes.\n\nJean's eye gained a focused clarity as all the insights she gained settled in place. It was at this point that she realised the existence of a turbulent mana whirlpool settling around her.\n\n\"Congratulations, Young Miss,\" Josie exclaimed with a beaming smile. \"Congratulations on achieving perfected resonance.\"\n\n\"There's no time for celebration,\" Jean snapped back. \"We need to begin immediately!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-153]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":66,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 151 - Vision","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nGuy coughed vigorously, as though he were trying to expel an obstinate entity firmly attached in his chest.\n\n*COUGH* *COUGH*\n\nGuy inhaled deeply and shoved out a large gust of air with a feral retch, nearly getting woozy in the process.\n\n*COUGH*\n\n\"Here, have some water,\" a concerned voice called out to him as a warm hand rested on his back, gently patting it in an attempt to soothe his discomfort.\n\n\"Thank you, Grace.\"\n\nGuy controlled his shaking hands to firmly grasp the offered clay cup and brought it to his lips. He took a few sips with measured gulps, letting the lukewarm water massage his throat as it descended his gullet. Yet he could never forget that dreadful pain he felt for a brief moment earlier. It wasn't his first time, after all.\n\n\"You should get it checked, that cough,\" Grace followed up. \"This one was a lot milder than last time. That time it got so bad that you were even hunched over. I was afraid that you would scrape out a large chunk of your lungs, given the intensity.\"\n\n\"You're probably right,\" Guy affirmed with a nod. \"My father's been after me to go in for my regular check-ups. He just called me yesterday and harangued about it.\"\n\n\"Lucky you, huh?\" Grace chimed in with a wry smile.\n\n\"Lucky, me,\" Guy mimicked. \"You didn't have to come on this mission, you know?\"\n\n\"Are you telling me what to do?\" Grace challenged with a frown, her sharp chestnut-brown eyes projecting a piercing glare. \"I'm a volunteer. Legally, you can't ask me to not volunteer when I haven't done anything that breaks contract-\"\n\n\"No,\" Guy immediately doubled back. \"It's just- I know that the last one was kind of hectic. High altitudes... Dry cold... Near imminent death caused by a rogue avalanche and all that...\"\n\nGrace scoffed and retorted by saying, \"You're worrying about me? I'm not the one coughing his life out.\"\n\n\"Grace...\" Guy sighed.\n\nGuy ran the Larks Foundation, which was a non-profit wing under Larks Enterprises. It was a new venture he had started after exiting with his teaching degree and was graciously funded by both his elder siblings.\n\nThe Foundation specialised in building schools and other pertinent facilities in rural and underdeveloped areas. Currently, the Foundation was touring across the Indian subcontinent after a rather fruitful venture in Central Africa.\n\nThe Foundation primarily functioned on a volunteer basis. Apart from the key personnel managing logistics, every other member present would have volunteered their time. The touring group would consist of a myriad of members with a wide range of expertise. However, amongst the constantly cycling and changing members, Grace and Guy were the only two constants.\n\nGuy was the anchor of the Foundation, so his presence was a necessity by default, although he preferred it this way. Yet Grace wasn't foisted with such a responsibility. In fact, Grace was the only 'volunteer' member of the Foundation who was provided with a salary. This was because Guy felt embarrassed stringing her along for no pay when she was the one handling a sizeable chunk of the tasks.\n\n\"You should take a break,\" Guy suggested again. \"You will tire yourself out.\"\n\n\"I'll take a break when you take a break,\" Grace retaliated.\n\n\"I guess we will be stuck together for a long time, then?\" Guy chuckled with a playful wink.\n\n\"I guess we will,\" Grace murmured shyly while turning her head away to hide her blooming cheeks.\n\nAt that moment, a faint voice coated with panic and fear pierced through the pinkish atmosphere. It was coming from outside their room.\n\n\"Teacher Larks! Teacher Larks!\" It was the voice of a little girl, and one they were familiar with.\n\n\"Teacher Larks, Grace Madam...\" The girl said while wheezing. \"Help please! Mother, ummm... birth. Blood, too much... flowing,\" she added with broken English. The girl's name was Mahima, and she was one of the kids that Guy and Grace would teach. She had unkempt hair, with dirt caught on it, and a washed-out frock with dirt and bloodstains marking the knee regions, almost as if she had fallen and hurt herself.\n\nGrace quickly responded in Hindi with the local dialect, \\``Mahima, Tell me, what's the problem?\\``\n\n\\``My mother is giving birth. But she is bleeding heavily. Please help us!\\`` The girl said amidst tears and snot.\n\nGrace's eyes narrowed as they caught onto a glaring bruise on the little girl's face and a trace of blood peeking out of her lips.\n\n\\``Who did this to you?\\`` Grace interrogated while gently cleaning the bruised region.\n\n\\``This? Umm...\\`` Mahima faltered.\n\n\\``Did your father do it?\\`` Grace shot back.\n\n\\``M-My father?! N-No...\\`` Mahima stuttered.\n\nGrace harrumphed in rage and proceeded to storm out.\n\n\"Grace, stop and think clearly!\" Guy quickly reminded. \"The girl's mother is in trouble. Luckily for us, one of the doctors volunteering is an OB-GYN, I'll fetch him. You should go and observe the situation there, help out, apply first-aid. But please, don't act rashly.\"\n\n\"I can't promise that, Guy,\" Grace growled as she rushed out with the girl.\n\nGuy went about as planned. With every mission undertaken by the Foundation, Guy made it a point to include at least one physician. Amongst those volunteering for this task, Guy prioritised Paediatricians, Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Performing volunteer work is always a beneficial entry to any aspiring physician's curriculum vitae, especially when under the Larks Foundation's purview since it was widely known and internationally recognised. Furthermore, volunteer work offered a great opportunity for practising physicians to hone their craft, away from the bureaucracy of standard medical establishments.\n\nThe OB-GYN volunteering for this mission was a relatively young guy with great ambitions. He was involved in many similar humanitarian ventures such as Médecins Sans Frontières, and was also involved with International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement as an affiliate member. Although his involvement was self-serving, Guy appreciated anyone who was willing to contribute their skills to the benefit of others.\n\n\"Dr Yagi,\" Guy called out urgently while knocking at the man's door. Almost immediately, the door slid open to reveal the figure of a bespectacled man with an appearance hinting to his far-Eastern ancestry.\n\n\"Mr. Larks, what brings you here at this time?\" The man inquired at a measured pace.\n\n\"There is an emergency!\" Guy followed up by explaining the situation the best he could. In response, the man frowned and hurried back into his room to pick up a white-coloured box and rushed out while dialling a number on his phone. Along the way, he rattled out practised instructions to the person on the other side of the line.\n\nOnce Guy and Dr Yagi arrived at Mahima's home, they were greeted by the awkward sight of Grace shoulder throwing Mahima's father into the ground.\n\n\\``If you raise your hand on your daughter one more time, I will personally remove that hand from your body!\\`` Grace threatened while dropping a heavy foot over the prone man's crotch, eliciting a wailing response.\n\n\\``Grace Madam,\\`` the girl next to her squeaked while tugging Grace's shirt.\n\nDr Yagi patted Guy on his shoulder and moved towards the house, \"I have informed personnel to prepare the appropriate equipment and medicine at the tent. I had checked this woman earlier, and she was close to giving birth. If my hypothesis is true, then we will have to go ahead with the delivery immediately.\"\n\nGuy nodded in affirmation before asking, \"Do you need our help?\"\n\nThe man simply hummed before entering. Guy followed the man in with faltering steps before a firm hand grasped his shoulder.\n\n\"Brace yourself, Guy,\" Grace warned. \"The woman, she's...\"\n\nGrace thrust a fierce glare at the drunken man rolling on the ground and added, \"There's a lot of blood...\"\n\nGuy took her advice seriously and moved in. Right as he passed through the thresholds of the house and entered the room where the woman presumably was, he was immediately assaulted by a strong smell of iron. On a hastily opened up mattress in the middle of the room, lay a pale, ghostlike form of a woman with a bulging stomach. Her bloodless face was accentuated with multiple bruises, with more injuries splotched across every inch of her revealed figure.\n\nAnd then the blood... So much blood! Guy's stomach churned as he was assaulted with a mix of fear, disgust, anger and helplessness.\n\n\"This is... suboptimal,\" Dr Yagi commented. \"This is the worst case, Mr. Larks. I'm afraid we have to extract the foetus through a C-section.\"\n\n\"What about the mother?\" Guy said with a low yet audible voice.\n\n\"She's lost too much blood. She's barely holding on to her consciousness. We must start on blood transfusion immediately. Furthermore, it appears as though she's suffered severe trauma in multiple sections of her body,\" Dr Yagi said while shaking his head.\n\nGuy grasped his hair with both hands and shrunk into a squat. He tugged on his hair firmly as he ground his teeth.\n\n\\``Save... the... baby...\\`` a low moan emanated from the deflated woman. \\``Please... save... the... baby...\\``\n\nThe woman's voice dissipated into thin air, leaving a morbid silence prevailing in the room.\n\n\"I'm taking that as consent. Since the patient has consented we do not need to request permission from her guardian,\" Dr Yagi interrupted. At that moment, a few more volunteer medical staff and logistic staff arrived carrying a stretcher with them. They arrived next to the unconscious woman and moved her onto it with a coordinated lift. The group then transported the woman at a brisk pace to a medical tent set up at the centre of the village, leaving Guy and Grace with the girl and her inebriated and unconscious father.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-152]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":67,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 150 - The Other Guy","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\"That's crazy! Absolutely not!\" Guy denied vehemently. \"I won't let you do that. There has to be another way, and we will figure it out.\"\n\n\"I'm sure there is, Teacher Larks,\" Jean affirmed. \"But we are short of time here.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may, these are TWO lives we are talking about here,\" Guy redirected. \"It's not right.\"\n\n\"I know that!\" Jean exclaimed all the while sporting an unperturbed face. \"The burden weighs heavily on me, Teacher Larks. I know that if I intervene and fail, I will be responsible for the death of a person. However, if I don't intervene and let her die I will feel much worse BECAUSE I knew that I could have done something that may have had a chance, albeit minimal, of saving both her and her child.\"\n\n\"I won't let you attempt something that hasn't been verified,\" Guy retorted.\n\n\"That's the thing,\" Jean interjected as she reached into her satchel. \"My mother had been working on this procedure for a while.\"\n\nJean retrieved a pristine journal and flipped through it to a specific section. \"She was developing a practice that could reduce the casualty rate of women going through childbirth. Not just mortals, but mages as well!\"\n\nGuy held the book and quickly scanned through its contents. Jean continued by saying, \"Although she didn't get far enough, she did manage to cement fairly functional procedures for mortals. In this entry, she describes her insights and successes, and details every step down to the minutiae.\"\n\nAs Guy read through the journal entry, his heart wavered. Although much of what was described in the book was only theoretical, its reasoning was verifiable through modern medicine and surgical practices. Well, this was only to the extent of Guy's expertise in the field, which was surface level at best. Through his time stuck behind the sterile hospital walls in his past life, Guy had augmented his base knowledge of medicine. This wasn't to say that any patient confined in a hospital for a long time could become an expert medical practitioner, but they would inevitably learn a fair bit about what is considered the norm in a hospital as well as the standard safe practices that prevailed within.\n\nGuy wasn't a doctor, but he was knowledgeable enough to deem whether something was safe by modern standards or not. And the procedure described within Jean's mother's journal was as close as it could get given the limitations of this world. She had covered multiple bases in her description and proposed possible failure points, albeit only through deductive reasoning, which Guy could confirm were valid in some ways. Sure, certain propositions sounded farfetched, such as the preference of cauterising the surgery over stitching it. Guy figured her belief in the superiority of the former over the latter may have to do with her overlooking the causes of infections and sepsis.\n\n\"This looks adequate, but the fact remains that you haven't practised this before,\" Guy pointed out. \"Everything is fine on paper, but when it comes down to applying it, how confident are you?\"\n\nJean's firmness wavered. Although it wasn't visible, Guy could feel her momentum deflating. \"I... I'm not confident.\"\n\nJust then, a thought sparked in Jean's mind. She pulled out a locket embedded with mana gems hanging around her neck and grasped it lightly. She then called out, \"Josie!\"\n\nRight as the name exited her mouth, the region in front of her flickered and a person manifested.\n\n\"Young Miss called for me?\" Josie responded with a deep bow.\n\n\"You've worked with my mother before. Can you perform this procedure explained here?\" Jean asked while handing the journal to Josie.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Josie quickly denied. \"This slave was only a companion - an assistant - while Madam performed. Therefore she does not know how to replicate Madam's methods. Apart from that, this slave specialises in alchemy.\"\n\nJean's face scrunched up in distress. She approached Chiani with faltering steps and grasped the woman's hand tight.\n\n\"Little girl,\" the midwife scoffed but was quickly countered with a firm and forceful stare from Josie. \"*cough* Young Mistress, I think we should proceed with my suggestion now.\"\n\n\"\"NO!\"\" Marie and Kannan burst through the doors, sheer panic laced in their voices. \"You can't kill my wife!\" Kannan vehemently rejected with a frantic stutter. His eyes had reddened veins bulging out, possibly through a surge of anger, frustration and sorrow. He rushed forwards and physically dragged the midwife out of the room, \"GET OUT!\"\n\n\"I'm leaving, I'm leaving!\" The midwife rebuffed as she shook herself free of the crazed man's grasp. \"Sheesh! You were the one who invited me here in the first place!\"\n\n\"GET OUT!!\" Kannan repeated. After ensuring that the woman was gone, he crumbled in place and dragged himself on his knees in front of Guy and Jean.\n\n\"Please! Please save my wife,\" he begged. \"Even if the child is lost, I don't care. Just save my wife!\"\n\n\"No...\" An exhausted voice interjected.\n\n\"Chiani?\" Kannan said as he shuffled next to his wife.\n\n\"Just... do it. Save our child... forget about me,\" she said between breaths.\n\n\"How can you say that?!\" Kannan denied. \"Teacher Larks, please don't listen to her. She isn't in the right frame of mind!\" He immediately exclaimed, in fear that those around him would act hastily.\n\n\"This...\"\n\nGuy was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either he lets the woman die while saving the child, hurting the woman's husband AND affecting his student mentally, or he lets Jean go through the procedure, causing the potential death of both the mother and the child AND affecting his student mentally. There was a clear winning play here which was to go safe. The first path had the least deaths, it was the obvious choice...\n\nBack on Earth, while he was confined to his bed, Guy would often surf through the offerings on television. During his mindless zapping spree, Guy one day stumbled upon a news segment that discussed, \"Top investments after winning the lottery.\"\n\nWhat an unusual segment it was. It was like discussing, \"Places to visit with your wings,\" or \"top 10 planets to colonise with your terraforming ship.\"\n\nAt that time, Guy scoffed at how the news industry had delved into the realms of fantasy. According to studies, the odds of winning a lottery jackpot hovers somewhere below 0.000001 per cent. Yet, humans were still willing to believe and hold on to the faint hope of winning it. How crazy was that?\n\nIronically, he was standing at a similar crossroads right now. He could take the smart choice, but a small part of him wanted to take the risky path that had a bleak chance of success. But by definition, hope implied possibility. At a cursory glance, the conditions didn't appear favourable. No one would believe that a girl barely stepping into adulthood would be able to excise a foetus safely.\n\nSo why was Guy hopeful?\n\n(I strongly advise against it,) Mast warned.\n\nGuy had currently receded into the RoK. In his hands lay the metallic mask which was cold to touch, and emitted a foreboding aura.\n\n'I don't have a choice here,' Guy responded with a bitter smile.\n\n(Everyone has a choice,) Mast retorted. (You could just turn a blind eye to everything.)\n\n'There lies the problem, doesn't it?' Guy commented. 'If I know for a fact that the \"other guy\" can help my student make a breakthrough, which could boost her performance in attempting the surgery, how can I sit still?'\n\n(Isn't the answer obvious? You aren't obligated to do anything, Guy,) Mast reasoned.\n\n'I disagree. If I hold the power in my hands to help someone else and potentially save lives, I am morally obliged to help them,' Guy said with a bitter chuckle. Unwittingly, he had quoted a rather worn-out line originating from a famous comic series back on Earth.\n\n(Even at the cost of hurting yourself?)\n\n'We don't know that. If I know that the power will hurt me, I wouldn't be taking this risk,' Guy said while shaking his head. 'I've already lived one life selflessly, I'm not planning to be so zealous in my second iteration. As it stands, there is only a possibility of suffering adverse consequences - nothing is proven. Therefore, I am willing to bank on this power until something detrimental shows itself.'\n\n(All it takes is one, Guy. One oversight, one slip-up, one chink in the armour, for everything to fall apart,) Mast reminded.\n\nGuy considered that point seriously. However, his conclusion remained firm, 'The risk is acceptable.'\n\nWith that, Guy brought the mask towards his face.\n\nThe moment Guy felt the cold metal contact his face, his mind warped in an instant. His present thoughts, fears and concerns dissipated into nothingness, only to be replaced with a strong sense of arrogance and unassailable confidence.\n\nGuy took a deep breath and opened his eyes, to grace the splendour of his Church once again.\n\n'It's been a while,' he said. 'It's good to be back.'\n\n'For too long has The Church been used to spread unrealistic and uninspired lies, desecrating the sanctity of the True World!' Guy sneered. 'Blasphemy!' He spat.\n\n'I will show you!' Guy declared. 'I will reveal to you all - my children and you, the false Prophet - The Church's real power!'\n\n'Open your eyes, and let The Truth enlighten you!' Guy orated with a crescendo.\n\nGuy's hand descended on the ethereal figure of Jean, as he smiled benevolently.\n\n'BEHOLD!'\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-151]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":68,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 149 - Constants and Transients","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\"Great master Nara!\" a man evoked, out of breath. \"It's happening, just like you predicted. M-My wife... she-\"\n\n\"-will be fine,\" Krish finished the man's sentence. \"Just do as I've told you, and fetch those three. Go, now! Don't waste time.\"\n\nThe man nodded firmly, his gaze filled with certainty and faith even though his heart was blaring in panic. And without an ounce of doubt, the man worked through his exhaustion borne of age and ascended the steps leading to the orphanage.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" Marie commented. \"I thought you promised to save Auntie Lane? Why is she struggling now, all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"I did change her fate. Her sacrifice was not in vain,\" Krish said with a mysterious smile. \"I believe you've made inquiries about these things before. Losing a thumb to save two lives isn't an equivalent trade. BUT, it was enough to alter certain events and hasten others so that the conditions at the time of her delivery lean heavily in favour of her wish.\"\n\nMarie narrowed her gaze in disbelief. She decided to exert her new technique and divined the outcome.\n\n'Will Chiani Lane die?' She projected. A wave imperceptible to others emanated from her and dissipated into her surroundings. Almost immediately, a response arrived which Marie pulled inside and decomposed using her technique.\n\n\"No?!\" Marie bellowed in shock. Right as she was about to bounce onto her feet and rush out, Krish called out and calmed her down.\n\n\"Stop panicking!\" He said. \"Frame your question properly. Did you just divine whether she would die?\"\n\nMarie nodded vigorously.\n\n\"Of course, she will die. She's a mortal! All mortals die eventually,\" Krish reprimanded. \"For someone who seeks precision, you are being quite gung-ho with your divination method.\"\n\nMarie bit her tongue apologetically and retried her divination.\n\n'Will Chiani Lane go through her delivery without complications?'\n\nAgain, \"NO!\"\n\nKrish clicked his tongue. Although it was an impalpable action, it echoed loudly within the room, pulling Marie down once again.\n\n\"You went hard in the other direction, didn't you?\" Krish asked rhetorically. \"Ask the following question: 'Will Chiani Lane and her unborn child survive the delivery without long-lasting detrimental consequences?'\"\n\nMarie calmed herself once again and repeated the process, but she repeated her Master's words verbatim. This time, the response she received was much more palatable.\n\nMarie exhaled in relief once she deciphered the message. After that, she decided to divine deeper along the same line of questioning.\n\n'How are Guy Larks, Jean Rasmus and Dora Reva involved in ensuring that Chiani Lane's child is born, and Chiani Lane is left without long-lasting detrimental consequences?'\n\nShe then waited for a response, yet none arrived. Marie pondered over her question, rephrased it and tried again while preserving the crux of what she wanted to be revealed. However, again, she wasn't graced with a response, only radio silence.\n\n\"That's odd,\" Marie muttered. \"I tried to divine a question, however, I received no answer.\"\n\nKrish nodded affirmatively and asked, \"What was the question?\"\n\n\"Basically, I wanted to know what role Teacher Larks and the rest had to play in Auntie Lane's birthing,\" Marie explained. She then reiterated and expounded on her question.\n\n\"The divination that we're performing is reactive in nature. The things that you can ask and receive responses to are therefore reactions to events that have already transpired or potential consequences of a series of events. So when you're asking about a person's involvement in an event that has yet to transpire, you are technically putting the cart before the horse.\"\n\n\"That's what's confusing, though. How is it that my divination can confirm the safety of a person, but not reveal how they will be saved?\" Marie inquired. \"Aren't the two related?\"\n\n\"They are. The reason why you can divine certain information but not others is to do with how these events play out in the grand scheme of things,\" Krish explained. \"This would be something you learn later on, but when it comes to events, there are primarily two kinds. Events that are 'Constants' and events that are 'Transient'.\"\n\n\"Constants refer to events that are guaranteed to transpire, while Transients refer to events that may or may not. As practitioners of The Heavenly Eye, being able to differentiate between these two is crucial for our survival. This is because we can affect Transient events with minor consequences, but tampering with Constants can cost us severely. Usually, Constants are defined as statements that aren't firmly tethered in time. For example, 'Chiani Lane will never be able to nurture and love her offspring'. This statement works in two ways, one: Chiani Lane can never give birth, two: if she does give birth then she won't be alive to care for the baby,\" Krish expounded.\n\n\"On the other hand, Transients are tied to a timestamp,\" he continued. \"'Winter will be late by a month,' or 'The current business venture will bear fruit in five years.'\"\n\n\"Chiani Lane's and her child's survival today is a Constant - I made it so thanks to her sacrifice. To achieve this, I had to tweak certain sequences so that the dominoes lined up perfectly,\" Krish clarified. \"Divination is safe because it skirts around Constants in fate's sequence - it exclusively deals with Transients. It can tell you what the outcome of a Constant will be, but it won't reveal much more than that. Can you tell me why?\"\n\nMarie pondered for a while before stating, \"Because knowing what will happen can also affect how it will turn out.\"\n\n\"That's right!\" Krish congratulated. \"Even if you don't intend to interfere, knowing implies a possibility of interference. Therefore, divination avoids revealing excess information surrounding Constants by default.\"\n\n\"But you implied that Constants cannot be changed, regardless of what people do to change it,\" Marie retorted.\n\n\"That's right, ordinary people cannot change the outcome of Constants, but we can. Therefore, we aren't shown what these Constants will be through divination.  Now then, let's return to our meditation, shall we?\"\n\nMarie nodded half-heartedly before descending into a meditative state... Or so she tried. The harder she tried to clear her mind, the more a feeling of curiosity gnawed back at her.\n\n\"Master?\" Marie poked in a low tone. \"Aren't you interested in knowing how things will play out? After all, you simply set up the sequence, you aren't aware of how it will all ensue.\"\n\n\"No,\" Krish denied nonchalantly. \"Why should I care about that?\"\n\n\"Didn't you contribute to it? Aren't you the least bit curious?\" Marie urged.\n\nKrish shook his head, \"Not at all. These trivialities are mortal concerns. We shouldn't get entangled with it. The more you entrench yourself into this mire, the more obligated you will feel to meddle in their affairs.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that. Why did you help Auntie Lane then?\"\n\n\"Because...\" Krish paused. \"It was... convenient...\"\n\n\"I bet that's what you tell yourself every time you help someone,\" Marie scoffed. \"For one, you had to use The Heavenly Eye to observe Auntie Lane's future, and then exert your power to change the sequence without interfering or tampering with any others that might intertwine with it. Doesn't sound that convenient to me.\"\n\n\"That's not true!\" Krish defended with a wavering voice.\n\n\"Whatever the case,\" Marie interjected. \"I'm going to observe, even if Master isn't.\"\n\nWith that said, Marie stood up and walked out in the direction of the Lane household. Krish frowned with slight distress as he observed her receding figure. After an intense introspection, he dropped his aversion and sighed in defeat.\n\nHe then got on his feet and followed his Disciple.\n\n____\n\nUpon his arrival, he was immediately greeted by all those present.\n\n\"Great master Nara! You came,\" An elderly woman exclaimed with a revering smile and low bow. \"Quick, Durkas, greet great master Nara,\" she urged a little boy standing next to her.\n\nThe boy copied his grandmother and displayed a deep bow.\n\n\"Great master must be here in search of Marie,\" the elderly woman commented. By now, everyone in the village knew that Krish had taken on Marie as his Disciple. Although there was some envy floating around, they all recognised that they could do nothing about their poor luck. Besides, no one was unaware of Marie's character. Everyone knew that the orphan girl had sacrificed her childhood for the benefit of her orphanage and her family. No other child in the village worked as hard as her. They all agreed that the opportunity she received was a fitting reward.\n\nThe elderly woman moved forward and gestured for Krish to enter the compound. But Krish shook his head and said, \"I'm just here to observe Miss Lane. After all, I feel responsible for her safety, given...\"\n\nKrish didn't complete his sentence, nor did he have to because the crowd already knew of the deal between Chiani and him.\n\nThe elderly woman quit urging Krish to enter and immediately commanded her grandson to fetch a chair. The boy reluctantly rushed into his house and carried over an elaborately-designed, heavy wooden chair, at least twice his height and placed it next to Krish. The woman reprimanded the boy for his callous handling of the furniture and then gestured for Krish to settle down on it.\n\nKrish made himself comfortable, as well as he could, and directed his senses into the house. Honestly, he could have done this from his own cottage. However, Krish felt it would feel more personal if he showed the support for his Disciple more visibly. It was all part of his attempt to change and become a better Master.\n\nInterestingly, in every instance where Krish had to make a decision involving his Disciple, he would ask himself: \"What would Guy do?\"\n\n\"Speaking of the man,\" Krish muttered as he focused on the stiff figure of Guy inside the house. In truth, Krish hadn't done much to alter Guy's path. The man's future was extremely murky, almost like he didn't have one, to begin with. However, there were glimpses of the man in the futures of those around him, which was odd.\n\n\"*tsk* Who else-?\" Krish noticed that he wasn't the only one observing the scene inside with his mana sense. He turned to the side and saw someone else doing the same - Al Jeeves.\n\nAs if the man could sense Krish's gaze, he opened his eyes and nodded faintly in recognition, which Krish reciprocated.\n\n\"It's happening again!\" Krish exclaimed suddenly as he sensed a sudden fluctuation in fate. He quickly activated his Heavenly Eye and directed it on Guy. In the man's dark figure, a small mote of bright light sparked into view. The last time this happened was when Markus achieved perfected resonance.\n\nKrish didn't know the significance of this occurrence. But seeing as he had never witnessed it happen before, he doubled his vigilance on Guy in earnest.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-150]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":69,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 148 - Emergency","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nJean retrieved a notebook from her satchel and started going through a data table at an opened page.\n\n\"This batch will contain an equal mixture of Carathian Poppy and Enduring Lotus seed oil,\" she indicated as she poured in a phial from its stand into the milky solution in the cauldron.\n\n\"That's a lot of vitality!\" Al commented. \"Are you sure that's safe for mortals?\"\n\nJean nodded and highlighted, \"We've measured the concentration well.

It is perfectly safe.\"\n\nAl murmured in affirmation and observed as Jean poured out the last batch of soap. He then turned to Guy and asked with a mirthful chuckle.\n\n\"Where's your tail? I don't see him anywhere.\"\n\nGuy squinted as he tried to decipher the joke, \"You mean Markus? He's... cultivating in seclusion.\"\n\n\"Wow! I never thought I'd ever say that sentence out loud,\" Guy muttered in a low voice.\n\n\"He must be close to breaking through,\" Al hummed. \"It's a feeling you get, you know? The urge to jump when you're close to the edge. Faithful to that analogy, either you fly, or collapse magnificently.\"\n\nNoticing Guy's increasingly dour expression, Al added, \"But I'm confident Markus will succeed in his endeavour. The boy is both diligent and intelligent,\" while patting Guy on the shoulder.\n\n\"I hope so,\" Guy murmured.\n\nA few days before Marie unlocked the ability to decipher the waves of fate, Markus approached Guy about entering seclusion. Guy didn't get it at first and waved it off as some form of a jest, but then the boy sat down and explained his reasoning. Apparently, the session with Marie brought forth interesting concepts that sparked some inspiration within him, and he believed cracking through this blockage might just give him some insight into his cultivation method and push him over the edge into Foundation Establishment.\n\nGuy didn't know what to say to that apart from acquiescing. His Disciple was eager to advance after stagnating in the same state for a significant duration, and Guy could feel that as well. The kid's cultivation method was still a mystery to them both. Through infrequent |Extrospect|, Guy could only determine that the boy's cultivation might have something to do with space. Neither Guy nor Al could decipher what it meant, even after thoroughly scouring through available texts.\n\nTo that end, no one could help Markus advance but himself, which was both commendable and concerning.\n\n\"Medium Sis, you didn't add any colour to this one as well,\" Dora commented, effectively redirecting the conversation.\n\n\"We're only conducting tests to see their medical efficacy, we aren't testing their marketability,\" Jean explained. \"Once we know that these work, we can move on to that.\"\n\n\"I will decide what colours to put in, okay?\" Dora demanded. \"The last time I let Medium Sis do it, and it came all drab and boring.\"\n\nJean exhaled lightly through her nose and said, \"Sure. When we get there, you will add the colours.\"\n\n\"Teacher Larks! Young Mistress Rasmus! Dora!\" A faint voice echoed towards the group, filled with heart-wrenching urgency and exhaustion.\n\n\"Teacher Larks!\" As the voice approached them, the group observed the hobbling figure of a middle-aged man approaching them. His face was warped with panic and concern and looked as though it had aged decades just within a short time frame.\n\n\"Uncle Lane!\" Dora called out in surprise.\n\nThe man stopped before the group and bent over, supporting himself at his knees and panting vigorously.\n\n\"Oh good... you're all here! Teacher Larks, Young Mistress Rasmus, Dora...\" He wheezed. \"Please. Help.\"\n\nJean's usually unperturbed face showed a trace of concern. \"What is the matter, Mister Lane.\"\n\n\"My Chiani,\" he blurted out with difficulty. \"She's... she's-\"\n\n\"Giving birth?\" Jean completed anxiously, to which the man nodded.\n\n\"It's early,\" the girl muttered. \"Let's go!\" She declared and sped out without a second thought, followed a few seconds later by Dora.\n\nThe man wore a pained expression as he began to hobble back. Climbing up the many steps up to the orphanage had drained him significantly, adding on the emotional turmoil of possibly losing his wife did not help either. Just as he was about to take his first step, a hand reached around and grabbed him. It pulled one hand of his upwards and draped it over a shoulder, while another hand reached to his other side and latched on firmly.\n\n\"T-Teacher Jeeves,\" the man exclaimed in shock and fear.\n\n\"Hold on tightly, and do not let go,\" Al instructed casually.\n\n\"What?!\" The man barely managed to ask before Al lifted off, zooming upwards.\n\n\"AAAAAAaaaaaaa...aaa...aa...\" His blood-curdling screams receded as he disappeared into the blue sky.\n\nGuy gazed in their general direction for a few seconds before a realisation struck him.\n\n\"What am I doing here?\" He blurted out in disbelief before following his student with a jog.\n\n____\n\nMuffled moans and pained screams echoed from within a sizeable house at the village. The commotion had inevitably attracted a large crowd, mostly consisting of women, who knew just by the tone of the screams that someone inside was going through an arduous birthing process.\n\n\"Chiani's really struggling. Where did Kannan run off to after leaving his wife all alone?\" One of the elderly women observing the scene commented with an irate tone.\n\n\"The midwife is inside,\" another pointed out. \"Kannan went to fetch Teacher Larks, Young Mistress Rasmus and little Dora.\"\n\nThe first woman clicked her tongue dismissively and commented, \"What use are they? One is just a Teacher, another is a spoiled little Young Mistress, and the third is a little girl.\"\n\n\"You can't say that Grandma,\" Durkas standing next to her interjected while shaking his head. \"Don't you remember? Young Mistress Rasmus was the one who healed Father when he fractured his arm a few months back. We all know that the Young Mistress is working to become a healer.\"\n\n\"Still!\" The elderly woman reinforced. \"What would a young girl and little child know about childbirth? What would a man know about childbirth?!\"\n\n\"Great master Nara instructed Kannan to do it,\" Durkas clarified.\n\n\"Really? Well, what's taking them so long? Quick, Durkas, you're younger and faster, go and fetch them. Kannan's probably winded midway through the steps!\" the elderly woman instructed hurriedly. \"If great master Nara said so, it must be important, we cannot afford to delay.\"\n\nRight at that moment, Jean rushed in. Without slowing down, she leapt over the surrounding thatched wall in one bound.\n\n\"Medium Sis! Wait up,\" Dora hobbled a few seconds behind, panting as she struggled to catch her breath.\n\n\"a...aa...aaaaaaAAAAAAAAAA!\" The figures of Al and Kannan Lane descended slowly from the sky, surprising everyone present.\n\nAs soon as Al released the screaming man he collapsed to the ground. With unstable footing, the man slowly managed to stand up, but he immediately hunched over and threw up violently.\n\n\"Umm, sorry about that,\" Al hummed apologetically. \"I guess, I didn't fly slow enough.\"\n\n\"I-It's oka- BLAAAARGHH!\" Al approached the nauseated man and gently massaged his back with an unpractised motion.\n\nBy this time, Guy had arrived as well. He threw a cursory glance at the two men before following his student, normally through the fence gate, into the house.\n\nGuy followed the sound of the woman's screams and quickly arrived outside the room where the delivery was taking place. He knocked loudly and called out his presence, before entering.\n\n\"T-Teacher LAAAAAARKS!\" the sweating, pregnant woman laying on her back barely managed to greet Guy before her contractions intercepted her.\n\n\"What's the situation?\" Guy asked Jean with a frown. Jean was currently sitting beside the pregnant woman with her hand placed over the bulging belly, inspecting the foetus using her mana sense.\n\nThe midwife who had shifted from her prominent position was a much older woman and was garbed in a closed outfit wrapping her head and face as well as the rest of her body. Although he couldn't see it, Guy could feel that the woman was miffed to sacrifice her position to a younger girl.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" The woman demanded. \"We need to get the baby out, otherwise both the mother and the baby's lives are forfeit!\"\n\n\"If we do it your way, we will be killing the mother!\" Jean challenged with uncharacteristic vigour. Her forceful declaration had unwittingly caused the release of a mana wave that intimidated the non-magical midwife.\n\nUnwilling to concede, the midwife held her ground shakily and said, \"That is the only way! Would you rather kill the baby, then?\"\n\n\"No,\" Jean repeated. \"We can save both of them. We MUST save both of them!\"\n\n\"Jean,\" Guy interjected while pulling the shaken Dora next to him before their argument devolved into a circular mess. \"What are you planning to do?\"\n\nDora silently cowered behind his back. She had initially rushed over excitedly in pursuit of an adventure, but she had grossly overestimated her mental constitution. Upon witnessing the struggle Auntie Lane was going through, the little girl silently vowed to never have a child in this lifetime.\n\n\"Teacher Larks, Auntie Lane's foetus is entangled in the umbilical cord,\" Jean quickly explained.\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Well, the midwife suggests two options that require either sacrificing the foetus or the mother for the sake of the other,\" Jean said. \"But... I believe there is a way to save both of them!\"\n\nGuy tilted his head sideways and asked. \"How is that?\"\n\n\"We cut open the womb and extract the child-\"\n\n\"That will just kill the mother,\" the midwife pointed out smugly. \"That's what I said first.\"\n\n\"We extract the child and then close the womb back together,\" Jean finished firmly. \"Just like my mother theorised.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-149]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":70,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 147 - Making Soap","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"It's been a while, Teacher Jeeves,\" Guy commented casually while his attention was rapt on a container of lye solution. He was with his two students: Jean and Dora, in the clearing outside the orphanage.\n\n\"Don't get me started,\" Al groaned. \"The sabbatical I applied for was denied because apparently, I 'was not involved in teaching or instructional activities in any way to warrant a sabbatical'. Kaist tore the application in front of me to boot. So I had to run a few lectures to appease the public.\"\n\n\"That should have attracted quite a crowd?\" Guy responded with a light chuckle. He gestured for Dora to place the stack of mould blocks on the ground next to him in an ordered grid.\n\n\"Not really,\" Al said with a devious smile. \"They were impromptu lectures at awkward hours. Not many even knew about it until the last minute, by which time I was long gone.\"\n\nGuy hummed in response and instructed Jean to place the small cauldron she was carrying next to the moulds. \n\n\"So what are you doing now?\" Al asked while cocking his eyebrows upwards with interest.\n\n\"Making soap,\" Dora responded with an excited hop.\n\n\"Soap?\"\n\nDora's pupils darted upwards as she narrated, \"Soaps are... surfactants used in cleaning.\"\n\n\"What are surfactants?\" Al inquired back.\n\nDora stuttered as she struggled to recollect the answer. She turned to Jean and pleaded with her eyes, to which her Medium Sis acquiesced readily.\n\n\"It is a substance that reduces the surface tension between a liquid and solid, liquid or gas,\" Jean answered. She then added, \"The soap can be used in households and personally to clean surfaces by getting rid of harmful microorganisms and oils.\"\n\nAl nodded contemplatively before asking, \"What use it for you? Can't you just cleanse yourself with mana?\"\n\n\"It isn't for us, Uncle Jeeves. It is for the people in the village. We are trying to develop a product to sell through the Rasmus Clan's apothecary channels,\" Jean clarified.\n\n\"Why is the clan investing into the mortal market segment all of a sudden? It doesn't pay as highly as the others,\" Al commented with a slight frown.\n\n\"Per item, that may be the case. However, non-magical consumers outnumber the mage population by a significant margin. Why should we forfeit such a market so easily?\" Jean said. \"But that is beside the point. We've been running an experiment in the village and found that people who use soap and wash regularly suffer from fewer illnesses than those that do not. The division is actually quite staggering - almost 90%.\"\n\n\"Mortals suffer from illnesses all the time,\" Al shrugged.\n\n\"But they don't have to,\" Jean affirmed staunchly. \"What good is a healer that segregates their patients based on their strength and status? If an illness or disease can be prevented, why shouldn't we take measures to do so?\"\n\n\"Alright, alright,\" Al waved his hand good-naturedly. \"I was just asking, you don't have to get all worked up. Besides, last I remembered there was something like this being used by mortals already.\"\n\n\"There is a crude alternative which is used primarily for cleaning clothes,\" Guy contributed. \"However, Jean discovered that they aren't clinically safe to use. In fact, excessive usage can even damage the clothes they clean.\"\n\n\"This soap has a myriad of uses across multiple market segments,\" Jean added. \"While the base substance is effective for use on skin, we can augment it to cater to a variety of scenarios. Infusing fragrant oils during manufacture doubles the soap as a perfume, this was especially attractive to the female population in the village. By pouring the substance into interesting moulds gives them exciting shapes and designs which is attractive to the young.\"\n\nAl hummed in contemplation before pointing at a rack of phials next to the cauldron, filled with a plethora of alchemical ingredients. \"What are those for?\"\n\n\"We are trying a series of medicinal soaps that will be infused with beneficial oils to augment certain aspects of life,\" Jean explained.\n\n\"This oil solution helps accelerate the rate at which injuries heal,\" she emphasised while holding a phial with a viscous red liquid.\n\n\"This oil solution provides nourishment to pregnant mothers,\" she continued. \"Unfortunately, there is currently only one pregnant woman in the village, and she is well into her third trimester, so we don't have a wide enough sample.\"\n\n\"Can we start now?\" Dora said with a pout.\n\n\"Sure!\" Guy answered enthusiastically. \"Make sure to keep a safe distance, Dora. The lye solution is extremely caustic.\"\n\nDora nodded vigorously and hopped a few steps back. She gazed with gleaming eyes at Guy, who was now pouring in the pre-processed animal fat into the cauldron.\n\nGuy moved with practised efficiency. This wasn't his first time making soap, after all. Back in his first life, Guy used to do this exercise regularly as a fun activity with his students. The process wasn't difficult and doubled as an enjoyable and educational project. Kids could have fun designing their own soaps, and dabble in science at the same time.\n\nAfter coming to this world, Guy was surprised to find out that soaps hadn't been invented in the traditional sense. There were iterations of old-school soaps such as the ones used in ancient Babylonia and Rome, however, they weren't optimal for use on skin. The general public had a pretty lax outlook towards cleanliness. While there were public baths and saunas here, deep cleansing was often relegated to a |Clean| cantrip that would expel visible dirt and oils. However, it was used sparsely due to its unusually high mana consumption which left the caster extremely drained and exhausted. While it was effective, it couldn't clear the surfaces of malicious bacteria and disease-spreading microorganisms, since no matter how strong magic may be, the user cannot target something they do not know of.\n\nApart from that, the public generally relied on alchemical concoctions, or bath salts as cleansing alternatives that had an equivalent, if not higher, efficacy compared to modern soaps. However, as expected, these were exclusively in use by the upper class.\n\nTherefore, the first thing Guy did after arriving in the village was to recreate soap from his memory. He introduced it to Grace, who latched on to it almost immediately after observing just how well it treated her skin. Jean took to it after she realised the potential the substance held in the field of healing and healthcare. Thus began the duo's fervent experiments to develop different varieties of soaps for different uses and applications. \n\nTo make soap, two key ingredients are required: fat and lye. Through the years, Guy had perfected the methodology to a T. The hardest part was of course sourcing the lye. Guy wanted to make the experiment repeatable and scalable, as well as accessible. To do that, considering a lot of his students lived in rural villages, Guy had modified recipes from the Internet and from books to fit their situation.\n\nLye could be made using wood ash. Obtaining wood ash wasn't difficult since most rural villages used wood as fuel for heating and cooking. Guy would fill a non-metallic bucket, which had a hole near the bottom to drain the lye out, with a few inches of non-alkaline gravels and rock. On top of that, he would fill in a substantial layer of sand. Above that, he would layer rocks or pebbles. Finally, he would fill the rest with the wood ash to just below the brim.\n\nOnce that was prepared, Guy would pour in distilled or filtered water, bit by bit. As the bucket filled in, he would tap the sides to let out air and add more till the water reached the brim. The bucket would then be covered and left overnight. The way to test if the lye was ready was by testing the density of the liquid, which is by lowering a potato into the liquid and observing its behaviour. If it floats, it's too concentrated and more water is required to dilute it. If it sinks, it needs more time for the lye to concentrate. If it hovers, then it is prepared and ready to be drained through the hole at the base of the bucket.\n\nLye is extremely caustic, and Guy would make it a point to warn his students to only handle the chemical under the supervision of an adult. This process of extracting lye from the wood ash is known as leaching.\n\nTo make the soap, the animal fat had to be melted into a liquid. Optimally it must be at a hundred degrees Celsius.\n\n\"Let's start with yours first, Dora,\" Guy declared. He then slowly poured in a measured quantity of lye water into the liquid fat in the cauldron and started to stir it.\n\nAs the liquid started turning a cloudy shade, he called Dora closer and asked, \"Can you tell me what's happening here?\"\n\n\"It's the spon- saponification reaction,\" Dora answered with some difficulty.\n\n\"Good! Have you prepared all the fragrances and oils?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"Yes!\" Dora chirped. \"This one is from my favourite flower. Medium Sis helped me infuse it into an oil,\" she said as she handed a small phial of murky pink oil.\n\n\"I want to gift it to everyone at the orphanage,\" Dora added with a bright smile.\n\n\"Awesome!\" Guy took the phial and poured it in with the cloudy, viscous liquid.\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\nDora nodded and retrieved a small pouch filled with colourful petals, as well as another phial with powdered colouring. Guy took those and poured them into the milky solution while continuing to stir them. As the solution reached a sufficient thickness, he carefully opened the spigot at the base of the cauldron and let it flow out into the mould placed at the exit. The cauldron belonged to Jean and was made of a highly resilient mana metal. It had a variety of enchantments on it that increased efficiency of draining, cleaning, as well as other tasks including rapid heating and cooling.\n\n\"There!\" Guy exclaimed as he handed the filled and closed mould to Dora. \"You should know the drill. Let it settle, and it should be ready by tomorrow.\"\n\nDora yipped excitedly and carried her creation away with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Let's get to the rest now, shall we?\" Guy asked Jean.\n\nJean nodded and began preparing the cauldron by herself.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-148]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":71,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 146 - (Interlude) Realisation","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Congratulations!\" Krish offered.\n\n\"Yeah, no thanks to you...\" Marie muttered in response.\n\n\"What was that?\" Krish retorted with stern disbelief.\n\n\"No thanks to you!\" Marie reiterated with an equally stern and accusatory gaze.\n\n\"Look, I offered to teach you,\" Krish confessed. \"It's not my fault that you decided to look elsewhere.\"\n\n\"You don't even try,\" Marie responded with a dejected frown. \"The least you could have done was entertaining a discussion and brainstorming with me. Are you so unwilling to compromise or bend by even a little?\"\n\nKrish pulled his lips into his cheeks and wore a conflicted expression. He was ashamed to admit that he agreed with Marie on that point. Although he'd let the girl off the leash to explore the subjects on her own, he hadn't completely stopped observing her. He was with her every step of the way, albeit only passively.\n\nThrough that, Krish gained a better understanding of how his Disciple's mind worked and how she learned. And he also learned how to teach her and get through to her. This brought upon its own set of dilemmas for Krish. For one, it required that he completely overhaul everything he knew and believed to be the right way to teach.\n\nIt wasn't all Krish's fault, though. After all, in his lifetime Krish only ever had one teacher, his Master. So everything Krish knew about teaching and nurturing disciples could only be extrapolated from his own experiences under his Master. This in and of itself brought with it the second problem since Krish did not have a particularly spectacular time in his Discipleship. The constant, harrowing assaults that put him near death during the early stages of his Discipleship had jaded Krish quite a bit. Although life became much better after the first hurdle, he could never get over the torture suffered in the beginning.  \n\nKrish anticipated that when he would pick up his Disciple, they would also have to go through the same treatment. In his books, it was the only way. Yet it was only after a Disciple was gifted upon him that Krish realised the flaw in that assumption. He really did not want to hurt his Disciple the way his master hurt him. At that time, Krish wondered whether his Master was equally affected while putting Krish through that treatment.\n\nYet unlike his Master, Krish could not muster up the resolve to torture his Disciple. Through his travels, Krish learned that it was only the mortals - who were cursed with a short life - that had the nerve to hope for a better or different future. An immortal such as himself had seen the futility of that hope and had become inoculated to that emotion centuries ago. Yet, at that juncture, Krish started feeling hopeful all of a sudden.\n\nMaybe it was a gut feeling, or the mortal human within him that urged Krish to leap. Krish couldn't confirm it by himself by gazing into the future. Sometimes, knowing can result in an unwitting deviation and he couldn't afford that. Krish decided to bank on that one per cent chance circling in his mind, and let Marie go about the process her own way. Surprisingly, she succeeded, thanks to Guy. Krish was elated to learn that there was a more humane way to overcome the initial speedbump. This would ultimately become a boon to the future practitioners of The Heavenly Eye!\n\nKrish was preparing himself to continue teaching Marie from this point onwards. Yet this was his second mistake. He had grossly overestimated his capacity to teach and severely underestimated his Disciple's bullish mentality. The girl sought perfection and invariability, he knew that much from her motivation to learn The Heavenly Eye. But her requirements extended to limits beyond Krish's and every past user of The Heavenly Eye's level.\n\nHe was stuck. He didn't know what to do to help his student achieve what she wanted. If Krish was given the option, he would simply force the girl to go through the steps he'd followed during his Discipleship and trudge along. However, he recognised that doing so would simply alienate the girl even further. So, he let Marie go about her business until she eventually came back.\n\nLo and behold, the most inconceivable thing happened. Marie figured out a method to decipher her divinations with frighteningly tight accuracy without using tools or trinkets. What shamed Krish even further was that Guy, a man who has no experience or knowledge about The Heavenly Eye, was the one who guided Marie to make this breakthrough AND achieve perfected resonance.\n\nNeedless to say, Krish was at his lowest point at the moment. Being looked down at by his own Disciple did not help in this matter either. He couldn't disparage the girl for thinking this way either. After all, it was his fault and his inability to adjust that led to this.\n\n\"What's next?\" Marie questioned offhandedly.\n\n\"Well,\" Krish sighed. \"You've reached a stepping off point. Unfortunately, beyond this, you cannot enlist the help of others. Doing so, in any way, could result in dire consequences for both yourself AND the other person.\"\n\nKrish noticed Marie's face droop visibly upon hearing this. He smiled bitterly and added, \"I'll try harder, Marie.\"\n\nMarie's head jerked upwards in surprise. \"I want to be a better Master. I really do. But you have to understand, I've lived like this for a very, very long time.\"\n\n\"And it's hard to change your ways,\" Marie completed the sentence for Krish. \"I get it.\"\n\n\"You're a smart girl, Marie,\" Krish continued. \"You are much smarter and more capable than I was at your age. You've contributed more to the legacy of our cultivation art within months, than what our antecedents have accomplished over decades.\"\n\n\"Teacher Larks had a lot to do with that too,\" Marie pointed out.\n\n\"Regardless, I will try harder to live up to your standards,\" Krish accented with a warm smile. \"Please be patient with me.\"\n\nMarie clicked her tongue and gazed incisively at Krish. \"Who are you and what have you done to my Master?\"\n\nKrish laughed uproariously.\n\n\"Come, let's stress-test your now technique, shall we?\" Krish proposed.\n\nMarie approached enthusiastically. \"Ask me a question, Master!\"\n\n\"Will it rain tomorrow?\" Krish responded slyly. Marie revealed a sarcastic smile and started to divine the answer. After a short half-minute, she said, \"A light drizzle.\"\n\nKrish repeated the divination using his cowrie shells and affirmed, \"Good. Another question then. When will Kano Reva return?\"\n\nThe duo continued the back and forth well into the evening, taking frequent breaks to replenish Marie's mana.\n\n\"It's uncannily precise!\" Krish exclaimed, to which Marie hummed proudly.\n\nKrish's face cycled through a few expressions, starting from a thoughtful frown and settling at an embarrassed smile.\n\n\"Umm, Marie?\" He started. \"Can you... Can you teach me how you did that?\" He said with a low mutter.\n\nMarie's eyebrows darted upwards in surprise. A smug smile threatened to form on her face, but she suppressed it immediately after she noticed the sincerity in her Master's request. She realised that he probably had to fight through centuries of indoctrination and inbuilt pride to voice the request to his Disciple.\n\n\"I will,\" she acquiesced. \"But I'm warning you that it won't be easy!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have thought otherwise,\" Krish responded immediately with a relieved sigh.\n\n\"So, tell me everything you know about mathematics. Don't leave out anything, I need to gauge your starting point,\" Marie instructed.\n\nKrish never thought he'd be tortured again in this lifetime. He assumed incorrectly...\n\n____\n\nAt the same, many kilometres away at Radiant City, a certain individual was pulling his hairs out tracking down the elusive Guy Larks.\n\n\"The trail ends here,\" Jo commented with a voice oozing with exasperation and irritation as he stood in front of the Academy's library.\n\nHis past month was a wild goose chase, hunting leads that all tapered into a dead-end. It first began with the Academy. Jo polled his connections to get his hands on the logs of the teaching apprentices from previous years. That led him nowhere since Guy had nothing to his name, no connections, no affiliation, nothing! Jo then looked into Guy's student at that time called Markus. That also led him nowhere since the Academy never took thorough records of students until they were at least tagged as worthwhile investments. Jo could not find any information about Markus' previous homes or affiliations either. \n\nFollowing that, Jo looked into the relationship between the kid called Kano and the Rasmus clan. This investigation was stopped right from the get-go because he was denied re-entry into the clan's mansion. Apparently, Jo's previous up-front critique of the Clan Leader's daughter and her inability to cultivate had backfired. Jo tried camping out near the mansion to see if he could catch the boy some way, but the kid never left the house without escorts or the Clan Leader himself.\n\nJo was close to giving up, until through some lucky happenstance, his colleague Mai remembered seeing Guy and the librarian together, conversing in a friendly manner on more than one occasion. It was a weak lead, but even the sound of flowing water is akin to gold for a thirsting man stranded in the middle of a desert.\n\nThis was why Jo was making his way through the library, towards the office at the back belonging to the mysterious librarian. Through some probing around the Academy, Jo managed to draw a vague image of the Librarian in his mind.\n\nWith each step, Jo started to feel a sense of growing pressure dawning on him. Jo had learned that the Librarian was a mage at the Core Condensation realm. The experience with Keegan had turned into somewhat of a trauma for Jo.\n\nAs he turned the corner, he came face to face with the door leading into the office. Jo gulped audibly, trying to suppress the growing urge to throw up with stress.\n\nA heavyweight bore down on him as he made the final approach shakily.\n\nHe stood an arm's length away from the door. He held his breath, lifted his hands and curled them into a fist. \n\nRight as his knuckles were about to descend onto the wooden door, a squirrelly voice interrupted him.\n\n\"Teacher Way, is that you?\"\n\nJo turned around to face the person who called him. He did not recognise the man. He had a rather unassuming appearance, someone who could blend into the crowd if not for his shrill voice.\n\nNot wanting to embarrass himself and the other person, Jo simply nodded with a courteous smile.\n\n\"Are you looking for Teacher Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Ah? Yes, I am,\" Jo answered.\n\n\"That's unfortunate. Teacher Jeeves just left a few minutes ago. He told me to take over for him.\"\n\n\"Do you know when he might return?\"\n\n\"He didn't say,\" the man answered.\n\n'Damn it!' Jo cursed internally. Like a deflating balloon, all the pressure bearing down on him started to dissipate at a frightening rate. Even though he reached a stable point, it didn't stop. His mind was shutting down and entering a state of fight or flight.\n\nAfter bidding the shrill-voiced man a hasty farewell, Jo rushed outside the library and collapsed around the corner.\n\nHis breath started to extend, but his lungs couldn't extract all the oxygen he needed. He started to sweat profusely, with growing agitation on his face. \n\nHe was hyperventilating.\n\n'What's happening to me?!'\n\n{You're having a panic attack.}\n\n'What? Why?' Jo responded subconsciously. 'Wait! System!'\n\n{...}\n\n'SYSTEM!!!!'\n\nJo Way wouldn't admit it, but he was scared. The actual fragility of his position dawned on him the moment he was suppressed by Keegan Lang. His assumption of how the world would work was overturned upon realising that there was probably another person like him in this world.\n\nTo top it off, this other person was impressively well hidden. His actions were measured and calculated. The way he influenced the world was also thoroughly paced. The man had already accumulated multiple backers without causing a single ripple or leaving any trails.\n\nJo Way, like any human, feared the unknown. He knew nothing about this other guy, and it was freaking him out. He didn't know the man's affiliation and intentions. He didn't know whether the man had any advantages or abilities like himself. For all intents and purposes, the man was an enigma.\n\nAfter finally calming himself from his panic attack, Jo shakily staggered upright and walked away. He subconsciously shelved his discomfort to the back of his mind.\n\n\"I'll meet you one day, Guy Larks!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-147]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":72,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 145 - 4EA (Part Two)","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nI use LaTeX conventions to define the mathematic formulae here.

Guy recognised that building up to the topics of Fourier Series and Transforms would take quite a bit of time, even with Marie's enthusiasm and receptivity to the rather arcane mathematical concepts leading up to it. All that said, Guy had seriously underestimated Marie's aptitude. What Guy assumed would take him at least a few weeks was accomplished in just one.\n\nGuy and Marie were alone in the classroom. After Markus' incisive remarks the last time, Marie had become more conscious about intruding into Guy's personal time with technical problems. She did, however, poke in once in a while to play a game or mess around with Markus who admittedly took his post as a Disciple way too seriously.\n\nThe girl was to maths like fish in water. Guy breezed through integrals and most other prerequisites, most of which Marie covered on her own with just a textbook. Needless to say, Guy was impressed and proud. Marie was a veritable mathematical genius, along the same veins as his elder brother, who she beat only because of the benefits being a mage provided.\n\n\"Today we will complete our rather hurried journey towards learning the Fourier Series and Transform. Before we begin, do you have any questions about what we've covered till now?\"\n\nMarie shook her head in response. \"I'm all good, Teacher Larks. We can begin.\"\n\nWith that, Marie entered a meditative state and Guy did the same to enter The Church through his core. Once the two had reentered through the dark screen that descended over the dais, Guy's voice spoke up.\n\n\"At its core, the Fourier Series harkens back to the same process as the Taylor Series, in that it is an infinite summation of functions to approximate another function. While the Taylor Series achieved this using polynomials functions, the Fourier Series does so using sinusoids. However, the limitation is that the function being approximated must be periodic, as in it should have a repeating pattern.\"\n\nAs Guy said so, a Cartesian plane materialised in front of Marie. On it, a simple square function was drawn: one that has a value of negative one between $t=-\\pi$ and $t=0$, and a value of one between $t=0$ and $t=\\pi$.\n\n\"Notice here that the function is discontinuous. You should have guessed by now that it is impossible to approximate this function using the Taylor Series as it isn't differentiable. However, that is not the case with the Fourier Series. AGAIN, as long as the function is periodic in nature, it can be decomposed.\"\n\nGuy stretched his hand, causing the single period of the step function to stretch out infinitely in both directions.\n\n\"Let us revert to the analogy between complex numbers and periodic functions.\"\n\nA circle with a radius greater than one took form at the origin. On its circumference, lay a red point. The circle started to rotate and roll forwards, and as it did so the red dot started to trace out a line that closely represented a sine function with the same period as the square wave.\n\nOnce the circle disappeared from view, the drawn line faded lightly and the circle returned to its origin. This time, at the location of the red point on the circle's circumference there was another circle with a much smaller radius. The red point translated to the circumference of this smaller circle.\n\nAs the two conjoined circles rolled forward and traced a line, Marie noticed that the two had varying frequencies of rotation as well. The smaller one rotated faster than the larger one. The traced line also had a warped shape with a small dip at the peak and trough of the previous (faded) sine wave.\n\nThis process kept repeating, with more and more circles joining the ranks, each with a different radius and frequency. As more were added, the traced line started to get closer and closer to the square wave that had faded into the background.\n\n\"This is the concept behind the Fourier Series. The mathematical definition is as follows:\"\n\n$$\nf(x)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}A_ne^{i\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}}\n$$\n\n\"where,\"\n\n$$\nA_n = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-\\frac{L}{2}}^{\\frac{L}{2}} f(x)e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}}dx\n$$\n\n\"Here, $L$ refers to the period of the function.\"\n\nGuy paused to let the information sink in with Marie. The girl gazed ferociously at the formulae, internalising it to the best of her abilities.\n\n\"Why don't we try some examples?\" Guy suggested, to which Marie nodded lightly.\n\nThe two retreated from The Church and Guy produced a few questions curated from the many readily available university-level textbooks in the RoK. The girl had some difficulty getting started but, unsurprisingly, she quickly assimilated the knowledge and solved the rest of them at record speed. Guy suspected that not even actual university students from Earth could breeze through those questions with the same level of ease as she did.\n\n\"I'm ready to move on, Teacher Larks,\" Marie declared as she stacked the answer sheets to the side.\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nUpon returning to the virtual space in The Church once again, Guy pointed out that, \"The next section will be fairly congested. We need to look into Fourier Transforms as applied to Continuous and Discrete-time functions. However, what will be of use to you is the Fast Fourier Transform that can be applied to sampled data. I cannot teach that to you very well as it is also a bit beyond my understanding. Though I can provide you with resources that will be of assistance.\"\n\nGuy then started his explanation of the Fourier Transform. By definition, a mathematical transform aims to shift the domain of a function from one to another to make it easier to solve certain problems. A basic example is logarithms. Logarithms are used to transform exponential functions and solve problems where the exponents are unknown since these cannot be determined in the exponential space. In the case of the Fourier Transform, this conversion is made from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nFourier Transforms, and their subset the Laplace Transform, can be used to solve differential equations. A differential equation in the time domain becomes a polynomial equation in the frequency domain which is a lot easier to solve.\n\nAfter explaining the concept, Guy revealed the formula to perform the transform for continuous-time functions.\n\n$$\nF(\\omega)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-i\\omega t}dt\n$$\n$$\nf(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(\\omega)e^{i\\omega t}d\\omega\n$$\n\n\"This is genius!\" Marie exclaimed in awe. She had already applied this transform on the very same square function from before and obtained a graph that indicated the same frequency and magnitude values as what she had obtained by performing the Fourier Series decomposition.\n\n\"Though I can see how this won't be directly applicable to my problem as of yet,\" she then added.\n\nGuy nodded and continued, extending into discrete-time Fourier Transforms and touching upon discrete Fourier Transforms [A/N]. By the time he finished, Marie had entered a light trance. She hurriedly grabbed the book Guy produced with the details of the Fast Fourier Transform and immediately plopped down on her seat, ready to devour its contents in earnest.\n\nRight then, Guy started to feel giddy from within. His inner mana was growing increasingly turbulent, far greater than before. He quickly settled down and started to circulate his mana through Yoga.\n\nGuy was so thoroughly absorbed with himself at this point that he didn't notice Marie undergoing a profound change as well. If observed carefully, Guy would have realised that it was something similar to what Markus had gone through.\n\nMarie's mind was rapidly beginning to churn through functions as she carefully devised the algorithm that could interpret the waves of fate. Applying the Fast Fourier Transform was the answer to her problems, she could feel that she was close!\n\nA large whirlwind of mana started to form above the Teacher and Student, the former being markedly larger than the latter. Guy's core expanded as more and more mana started to circulate and nourish it, as well as his bones and internal organs. This was Guy stepping into the Internal stage of the Foundation Establishment realm. Just like before, a large quantity of pungent waste was emitted through Guy's pores in the form of a black vapour. This time, though, his clothes hadn't disintegrated as Guy had the presence of mind to quickly dissipate the heat while forming a protective layer around himself. He was NOT planning to become nude again!\n\nGuy's cultivation advancement did not show signs of slowing down though. This was because although Marie had safely stepped into the Late stage of Mana Condensation realm, her core was still undergoing a profound change.\n\nAt this point, Marie closed her eyes and observed her environment using her mana sense. She quickly tuned to the channel that corresponded to the waves of fate.\n\nShe reached into her pockets and retrieved a copper coin. The copper denominations circulating in the Solar Empire had an etching of the symbol of the Emperor's clan, a sun with undulating rays, on one face and the seal of the authority that minted it on the other. When tossing a coin, the sun would represent heads and the minting authority's seal would be the tail's side.\n\nMarie quickly tossed the coin high up into the air and projected her question.\n\n\"Will the copper coin land heads or tails?\"\n\nThe waves of fate emitted from her and a response was received. Marie directed the waves through her open palms and directed it through her mana channels into her brains. Her mind was prepared with the Fast Fourier Transform function loaded in place. Right as the waves interacted with the abstract function in her mind, a profound reaction took place that confused even Krish who was diligently observing the situation from his cottage.\n\nMarie immediately obtained a spectral analysis of the wave and siphoned it through a filter in her mind that isolated the frequency with the greatest amplitude, ejecting the rest from her body.\n\nThe isolated wave was received, and unlike before, Marie wasn't assaulted by white noise but an actual vision that, though short, clearly showed her copper coin landing heads up.\n\nA minor explosion took place within Marie's core as she underwent perfected resonance. Her advancement started to teeter off, stopping just short of breaking into Foundation Establishment, exactly like Markus.\n\nLo and behold, the moment Marie reverted to her regular vision, the copper coin descended. It bounced on the ground three times, before rolling on its sides and spinning out with the sun facing upwards.\n\nMarie did not pause and repeated the exercise again. And again. And again! She did it fifty times in total.\n\nWith each repetition, Marie's advancement started to slow down, and so did Guy's, until both their cultivation settled to a stable halt.\n\n\"I did it, Teacher Larks!\" Marie beamed with a striking smile. She rushed forward and hugged Guy tightly. However, her grasp started to slowly slip as fatigue attacked her. Evidently, utilising this ability to divine the outcome of a coin toss fifty times had exhausted her.\n\nGuy shook his head in defeat and quickly levitated Marie away from him to avoid getting the stink of his ejected waste on her.\n\nHe looked around cautiously before sneaking back into the orphanage.\n\n\"I hope Grace isn't home. If she sees you unconscious again...\" Guy stroked his neck and dabbed the sweat forming on his forehead, as his mind conjured a frightening image of Grace choking him feverously.\n\n\"Nope! Can't have that...\"\n\n____\n\nA/N: DTFT and DFT are two different things. I am not going to exhaust you with this as it isn't really pertinent to the story.

You can find the properly formatted derivation at the Discord Server.\n\n____\n\nGuy somehow got used to the convenience brought on by The Church, especially in pedagogy. Although the RoK was an insane tool that offered its own benefits, they were generally self-serving in nature. Guy could use it to refer back to his past knowledge and he could use the computer to run simulations or programs, but these functionalities could easily become redundant. With increased strength and cultivation, Guy could memorise and recollect vast quantities of information at a moment's notice. This also extended to running simulations or programs, as it was possible to segment mental operations at higher realms of cultivation.\n\nThe only function of the RoK that could scale and have potentially game-breaking ramifications would be the printing functionality. Guy could only print out one copy of books from the RoK that exceeded the similarity index limit. For instance, even if Guy had a copy of some rare cultivation manual in the RoK, he could only produce a singular printed copy of it. However, if he really wanted to make a profit out of that, he could commission a printing company to make infinite copies out of that replica obtained from his RoK, since these repeat copies wouldn't be moderated by Mast's powers. (Only printed replicas of books from Guy's original world are moderated. Only a single hard copy of them can exist outside the RoK - they cannot be reprinted physically).\n\nGuy could do that, but he chose not to. For one, it would be highly immoral and disrespectful to break secrecy especially if it wasn't in his authority to divulge it. Secondly, doing so would inevitably draw the attention of interested parties who may be beyond his level of strength. Finally, Guy just wasn't that ambitious. \n\nIn the end, Guy found himself quickly growing out of the RoK. The Church, on the other hand, was becoming more and more relevant to him. It was primarily because its functions and uses extended outwards. As a teacher in a world that was sorely regressed technology-wise, Guy was constantly wanting for tools and materials that could improve his student's level of assimilation. Most of these resources could be reproduced using available resources through Guy's experience teaching in villages and remote regions. However, as Guy began covering harder and more advanced topics with his students, the available resources were quickly becoming obsolete and insufficient.\n\nIn this predicament, The Church was to Guy, as a bladder of water was to a thirsting man stranded in the middle of a desert. It was a remote teaching tool, a VR simulator, a student progress tracker, and a self-cultivation tool all wrapped into one convenient, albeit potentially dangerous, package.\n\nAt first, Guy had his apprehension and aversion with The Church, given his early experiences accessing it with the use of the mask. But after finding another pathway, and one that did not require him to suppress his rationality for unabashed zeal, he was getting more enthused to it. In fact, in the past months, Guy had used The Church multiple times to augment some of his lessons. Although his level of mastery with The Church's facilities wasn't as superior as the \"other guy's\", they did the job and netted him a small boost in cultivation along the way.\n\nThis time, Guy intended to use The Church to graphically display the effect of applying the Taylor Series approximation to functions.\n\nThe group were currently standing in a greyish room, and projected in front of them was a pair of axes representing the Cartesian x-y plane.\n\n\"For this exercise, we will approximate the function:\"\n\n$$\nf(x) = e^x\n$$\n\nAs Guy voiced out this command, a line started to form on the x-y plane that closely resembled the exponential function.\n\n\"We can prove that this line, in fact, represents the exponential function by substituting values for the independent variable.\"\n\nGuy gazed meaningfully at his students, who nodded affirmatively to indicate that proof wasn't necessary.\n\n\"We can choose the point from where the approximation can be initiated, that is $x_0$. To make our lives easier, let's take $x_0=0$. Thus, we can calculate the coefficients for the Taylor Series:\"\n\n$$\nf'(x_0) = e^0 = 1\n$$\n$$\nf''(x_0) = e^0 = 1\n$$\n$$\nf'''(x_0) = e^0 = 1\n$$\n\n\"As you already know, the exponential function with the natural base is special in that when you derive it, you get the same function. By now substituting these coefficients into the series, we get:\"\n\n$$\nf(x) = 1 + x + \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{6}x^3 + \\frac{1}{24}x^4 + \\dots\n$$\n\n\"If we take each term in this series, and treat them as separate functions, it looks something like this:\"\n\nOn the plane before them, the line representing the exponential function slowly regressed into the background. In its place, the following functions started to materialise with different colours.\n\n$$\nf(x) = 1\n$$\n$$\nf(x) = x\n$$\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 \n$$\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{6}x^2 \n$$\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{24}x^2 \n$$\n\n\"Now, let us start superposing these functions one at a time and see how they compare against the original function.\"\n\nAs the functions were added incrementally, the line started to get closer and closer to the faded exponential function in the background.\n\n\"Wow!\" Markus exclaimed. \"This works with every function?\"\n\n\"It does,\" Marie chimed in confidently.\n\n\"How do you know?\" Markus retorted doubtfully. \"We just learned this.\"\n\n\"It's not my fault that you aren't bright\", Marie clicked her tongue in annoyance and derided Markus. \"I already tried it out mentally, and it works with every function I can think of.\"\n\n\"You did all of that in your head?\" Guy commented in surprise.\n\nMarie smiled back sheepishly and answered, \"I devised a method to visualise and execute functions mentally. It's what I used back when I tried to observe the waves of fate.\"\n\n\"So Teacher Larks, how does this connect to your previous point about representing functions as a weighted summation of sinusoids?\" Marie proposed.\n\n\"That is the Fourier Series,\" Guy clarified.\n\n\"What is Fourier?\" Marie tried.\n\n\"That's the name of the mathematician who developed it,\" Guy answered.\n\n\"He must be a great Mage to be able to create such a method. Just like Euler and Taylor,\" Marie commented with an awestruck expression.\n\n\"Sure...\"\n\n\"Anyways, unlike with the Taylor Series, the Fourier Series and the subsequent Fourier Transform, which is what will help you in your current predicament, necessitate a lot- A LOT of prerequisites. We will have to barrel through a plethora of topics such as complex numbers, integration...\" Guy wore a distressed expression before inquiring, \"Are you sure you want to go through with this? We will be rushing through them. It will be intense!\"\n\nMarie shrugged nonchalantly and said, \"If it is necessary. Besides, I think it will be fun!\"\n\n\"Of course, you'd think that,\" Guy chuckled. \"That leaves you, Markus-\"\n\n\"I'm going to sit out of this one,\" Markus offered immediately with a wry smile. \"I can anticipate a roadblock incoming. I'm planning to take it slow and digest what I've just learned.\"\n\nGuy nodded with a sympathetic smile, \"Don't beat yourself up over this. It has a lot to do with how easily people perceive certain truths and concepts. You find it easier to relate to phenomena that can be observed physically, while Marie finds it easier to assimilate abstract theories.\"\n\nMarkus shrugged understandingly. \"Don't worry, Master. I'm not affected. Understanding your limitations is the first step to development, after all.\"\n\nUpon saying that, Markus' ethereal figure turned static and regressed to his seat on the congregation.\n\n\"Now,\" Guy declared to his remaining audience member. \"Let's start with complex numbers, then.\"\n\nComplex numbers are an interesting development in mathematics as they comprise of a real and a rather unfathomable \"imaginary\" component. They stem from the idea of square-rooting a negative number. As known, it is impossible to obtain a root of a negative number as the converse isn't possible: it is impossible to obtain a negative number by squaring another number. A mathematician in the 1500s conceived this idea of imaginary numbers when he hit a brick wall in trying to solve a cubic equation non-graphically. By introducing the imaginary component 'i' into the fold, his problem could be overcome resulting in, on-paper, a viable method to obtain the solution.\n\nAt that time, the use cases for complex numbers were limited. However, De Moivre and Euler in the 1700s realised that complex numbers and the so-called imaginary value 'i' could also assist in solving complicated trigonometric and exponential problems. This brought to attention an interesting conceptualisation of what a complex number could mean. Where before, it was simply a placeholder to ease mathematics, it now had a graphical explanation.\n\nComplex numbers could be described as a transform operation in two-dimensional space. This includes both scaling and rotation. Essentially, a complex number $3+2i$ ('3' is the real, and '2' is the imaginary component) could be described as a scaling operation of magnitude $\\sqrt{13}$ $(3^2 + 2^2 = 13)$ and rotation of approximately $33.7 \\degree$ $(\\tan^{-1}\\frac{2}{3})$.\n\n\"Make sure to keep this conceptualisation in mind,\" Guy highlighted as a projected image in front of him visually presented this explanation. \"It will come into use when we finally touch upon the Fourier Series and the Fourier Transform.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-145]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":74,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 143 - Series Representation of Functions","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nA/N: I use LaTeX conventions to define the mathematic formulae here. It may not make sense on your mobile device or computer. You can find the properly formatted derivation at the Discord Server.\n\n____\n\n\"You think of me too highly, Marie,\" Guy said while shaking his head with a cynical smile. \"How do I help you if I can't even see these waves of fate?\"\n\n\"I just need an idea. An inspiration. A direction. Anything,\" Marie emphasised. \"Anything at all.\"\n\nGuy released an audible sigh. Honestly, he was a little conflicted about the current predicament. Many thoughts were circling in his mind questioning the feasibility of his intervention. Usually, in a Master-Disciple relationship, there was little space for a third party to contribute especially when it came to details regarding core cultivation techniques, such as The Heavenly Eye. He realised that he was already pushing on a rather precarious boundary by helping Marie that time when she tried to sense the waves of fate. Although he wasn't reprimanded or warned by Krish, Guy had recognised internally that that would be his first and maybe last time.\n\nYet, here they were again.\n\n\"Am I allowed to interfere? Mage Nara?\" Guy asked out loud.\n\n'Go ahead,' response was received immediately in his mind through Mana Transmission. 'She expects more than what I can provide her. You're the only one who can satiate her boundless curiosity.'\n\nGuy shrugged affirmatively.\n\n\"Your Master has acquiesced,\" Guy informed Marie, to which the girl subconsciously unwound her tense fists.\n\n\"Before I can offer anything, I need some insight into these waves of fate. How do they look? What do they feel like?\" Guy then emphasised the last point by adding, \"Be as descriptive as possible.\"\n\nMarie sat up straight and orated her insights and perspective on the topic. Along the process, Markus and Guy chimed in with pertinent questions that augmented their understanding. Following an information-packed half an hour, Marie closed her explanation with a loud, satisfied exhale.\n\n\"That just about covers everything,\" she concluded.\n\n\"So it literally IS a wave,\" Markus hummed.\n\n\"It MAY be just the way Marie and Mage Nara perceive it. After all, biases can be introduced by simply naming something a particular way,\" Guy countered. \"For instance, if we label them as strings of fate maybe - MAYBE - they might be perceived differently.\"\n\n\"Nonetheless,\" Guy quickly added. \"The fact that they're observed in this fashion does make our life a little easier. After all, waves are common in physics and are how energy can be transmitted.\"\n\nMarie and Markus' eyes sparkled as they prepared for Guy's insight, but their instructor immediately caught himself and declared, \"Let's continue this in the classroom. I need my chalkboards. Oh, and call in Jean as well! Even if she isn't interested in this, it may be of use to her.\"\n\n____\n\nGuy and his three students were now at the classroom which had undergone a pleasant overhaul. It was still open-aire - partly due to Guy's insistence on it being conducive to learning - however, the floor was properly built flat with an elevation. There was also a small arena nearby that could be used to practice magic. The classroom as a whole was now more detached from the orphanage. In fact, it looked closer to the newly built schools Guy would work at during his travel, albeit with far more robust foundation and facilities.\n\n\"Let me define the problem statement once more,\" Guy started. \"If we redefine the waves of fate as a signal, then the received signal is a superposition of multiple signals each corresponding to a different message or vision. These component signals are differentiated by their magnitude, which should correspond to the likelihood of their occurrence. Am I correct?\"\n\nMarie affirmed with a nod.\n\n\"Then we require to be able to separate these component signals from the summation and only tune in to the one with the highest likelihood,\" Guy added.\n\n\"This problem actually has a mathematical solution,\" right as Guy finished this statement, Marie's eyes gained a spark beyond measure that emanated visible excitement. She was enthralled to know that her predicament could be solved by her favourite subject in the world.\n\n\"It is a high-level topic, so be warned that you may not comprehend it at first. Furthermore, it isn't a requirement for everyone present to learn it,\" Guy highlighted. \"By that, I am referring to you, Jean. Once you hear it out, if you feel that it is irrelevant or uninteresting to you, you don't have to learn it.\"\n\nAfter taking a short pause for dramatic effect, Guy declared, \"What if I told you that all periodic functions (or waves) can be defined as a summation of sinusoids?\"\n\nHis students frowned as they pondered on that statement. They knew what functions were: they were relations that connected input to output given that a single input could only produce one output (many inputs can produce the same output, but the reverse is not applicable). The inputs to these functions are defined as independent variables, which is usually time when modelling most real-life phenomena. A function can be continuous, in that there must be an output for every possible input on the real number line, or have discontinuities. A function can be differentiable across all inputs, in that the change in slope of the function does not change too flagrantly at a given point, or not. \n\nA sinusoid, when defined in mathematics and physics, refers to the types of functions that repeat periodically or generally resemble sine or cosine functions. Sinusoids have a fixed maximum and minimum value that they can assume regardless of the independent variable. It is because of this quirk that Markus, Jean and Marie found it difficult to fathom that any periodic function in existence could be modelled as summations of sinusoids.\n\n\"I know what you're thinking. What if there are discontinuities in the periodic function? What if the function isn't always differentiable? Sinusoids are technically continuous and differentiable\" Guy fired. \"Well, the complete definition is that a function can be theoretically defined as an INFINITE weighted summation of harmonically related sinusoids. The key is infinite!\"\n\n\"If that were the case, then it would be possible to define the received wave of fate- let's call it a signal of fate to match terminology- we can define them as the individual summations of the signals that comprise them, right?\" Marie chimed in, immediately grasping at the crux of Guy's idea. \"Right! Then we only need to look at the signal with the greatest weight and that would be the event of the highest probability!\"\n\n\"You seem to have absorbed the idea quite readily, Marie,\" Guy commented. \"Does it make sense to you?\"\n\n\"It's a proposition,\" Marie responded. \"If we take the proposition to be true, THEN the solution seems apt. If we begin with that assumption, then the problem can be restructured as proof instead of exploration. I find it easier to prove or disprove a theory than exploring without direction.\"\n\n\"But I don't quite get how such series can be defined,\" Marie pointed out.\n\n\"There is actually an analogous serial decomposition of functions known as Taylor Series. In that, a function - not necessarily periodic, but one that is differentiable - is broken down into an infinite weighted summation of polynomial functions,\" Guy proposed.\n\n\"Note that this serial representation is only an approximation if taken to a finite sum. And it is centred around a point. Let us assume that it can be written as follows:\"\n\nGuy picked up a chalk and started writing on the board.\n\n$$\nf(x) = a_0 + a_1(x-x_0) + a_2(x-x_0)^2 + a_3(x-x_0)^3 + \\dots\n$$\n\n\"Here, the a-sub coefficients are unique constants and $x_0$ is the point around which the approximation is being made. If you remember from before, $f(x)$ is how we define a function depending on the independent variable '$x$'. Our task now is to determine what these a-sub coefficients might be. So first, if we take the value of the function at the point along which it is approximated:\"\n\n$$\nf(x_0) = a_0 + a_1(x_0-x_0) + a_2(x_0-x_0)^2 + a_3(x_0-x_0)^3 + \\dots\n$$\n$$\nf(x_0) = a_0\n$$\n\n\"For the successive coefficients, we take derivatives of the original function:\"\n\n$$\nf'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2(x-x_0) + 3a_3(x-x_0)^2 + 4a_4(x-x_0)^3 + \\dots\n$$\n$$\nf'(x_0) = a_1\n$$\n\nGuy then proceeded to repeat the processes and wrote:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}f''(x_0) = a_2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{6}f'''(x_0) = a_3\n$$\n$$\n\\dots\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k!}f^{k}(x_0) = a_k\n$$\n\n\"Therefore, the Taylor Series representation of any function can be written as:\"\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k!}f^{k}(x_0)(x-x_0)^k\n$$\n\n\"Does it make sense?\" Guy called out and observed the faces of his students. He noticed Marie and Markus nodding, but Jean had an unusually vacant expression on her face.\n\n\"Teacher Larks,\" Jean volunteered while raising her hands. \"I'm lost.\"\n\n\"Where did I lose you?\"\n\n\"It's the differentiation. I'm kind of struggling with the first principle of differentiation and limits in general.\"\n\nGuy nodded while scratching his chin, \"Right! I forgot that we are still going through the limits method of differentiating functions. It's okay then. You don't have to sit in, we can cover this at our own pace at a later date.\"\n\nJean affirmed audibly before packing up her things to leave.\n\nGuy sighed as he observed Jean's retreating figure, \"I was too eager to share that I falsely evaluated the extent of her knowledge. I must have wasted her time...\"\n\n\"Master,\" Markus called out while raising his hand. \"I'm having some difficulty picturing this.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" Guy pondered. At this point, he would very much enjoy having a laptop of some kind to present the effect of the series visually. Suddenly, an idea flashed across his mind.\n\n\"You two, enter a meditative state. Quickly!\" Guy instructed as he himself seamlessly entered his core. With familiarity, he passed through the clear pool to access The Church and pulled his students inside.\n\n\"Look ahead. I will show you a simulation that might be useful to you,\" Guy clarified as the black screen descended above the dais.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-144]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":75,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 142 - Back to Formula","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nWhen Marie returned to the orphanage, she was immediately attacked by Grace and pulled into an emotional embrace. Through her sobs and muffled whimpers, Marie realised the extent of the damage her haphazard actions had caused to those around her.\n\n\"I am putting my foot down! No more of this, Marie!\" Grace demanded.\n\n\"That's not going to stop her, Grace,\" Guy interjected as he carefully pulled Grace off of Marie.\n\n\"So you're just going to let her go through with this?\" Grace exclaimed. \"She was out for two days! TWO. DAYS.\" She added while forcefully jutting out two fingers in front of Guy's face.\n\n\"But she's back now, look!\" Guy gently turned Grace around and spoke in a low voice into her ears. \"Let me handle it. If we force her to cease, it will only make her want to do it more. You know how teenagers are?\"\n\n\"We have to be strategic in our approach. Although we cannot stop her, I will ensure that she maintains caution in her actions. Alright?\"\n\nGrace grunted in reluctant acquiescence. Before leaving, she sternly warned Guy, \"You better fix this!\"\n\nAs Guy watched Grace retreating into the orphanage in a huff, he revealed a bitter smile.\n\n\"And you, young lady,\" Guy started. \"I am extremely disappointed by the way you handled the experiment. This is something I would have expected from Markus, not you. You should have ceased when things exceeded the extent of your capacity. What was the point in hurting yourself by prematurely attempting something like that? We could have taken things gradually, with multiple sessions, to build up your tolerance.\"\n\n\"I got impatient,\" Marie said apologetically.\n\n\"I get that you are anxious to advance in your cultivation, but nothing good can come from being reckless and careless. If you're planning to approach a problem with the scientific method, you MUST adhere to the process in its entirety,\" Guy instructed. \"Trial and error without conducting the proper due diligence isn't science.\"\n\n\"I-I'll be better,\" Marie responded. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Although your actions only hurt you physically, they have affected everyone around you emotionally. I'm not the only one who is in need of an apology.\"\n\nMarie hummed submissively and trudged into the orphanage with a dejected hunch.\n\n____\n\n\"Wow, Big Sis! You're already at the Middle stage of Mana Condensation realm?\" Markus exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"We're now at the same level,\" Jean added with a blank nod.\n\nMarie nodded vehemently with a smug grin.\n\nThe pleasant atmosphere was suddenly interrupted by a defeated sigh, coming from Markus.\n\n\"What's got you down? You look as though you've eaten a handful of shit there,\" Marie commented while clicking her tongue.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Markus waved his hands immediately in response. \"I just can't help feeling jealous of you guys. It took me so long, and so much effort to just step into the Middle stage of Mana Condensation. All it took you, Big Sis, was maybe a month.\"\n\n\"That's obviously because I have a legitimate cultivation method and you don't,\" Marie consoled. \"If you had one of your own, you too would have risen as fast as I.\"\n\n\"I get that. But what about Jean, then?\" Markus whined and exhaled loudly.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Markus ceded. \"I'm projecting. It's just that I'm feeling really stuck right now. No matter what I do, I'm getting nowhere. My cultivation has stagnated, and all my attempts in replicating Gaige's attack have failed spectacularly.\"\n\nThe two girls sympathised with Markus' plight.\n\n\"You need a fresher perspective,\" Marie chimed in.\n\n\"I know-\" Markus started, by Marie quickly interjected by raising her hand.\n\n\"Hear me out! I know that you've considered the problem from all directions to the best of your knowledge. But I think that the issue is that you're too close to it. Maybe if you take a few steps back and observe the problem in a wider context, it will make more sense. It worked for me, maybe it will work for you too?\" Marie suggested.\n\n\"Wider context, huh?\" Markus muttered. His gaze turned vacant and he casually stood up from his spot. While intermittently repeating that phrase, Markus slowly exited the room with a measured pace.\n\n\"What happened to him?\" Marie blurted out.\n\n\"Senior Brother does that often when he enters an inspired state,\" Jean explained with subtle affection in her tone. \"He's a troubled genius. He's achieved so many amazing things, yet he is perpetually dissatisfied with himself. I wish there was something I could do to help him...\"\n\nMarie chuckled lightly when she noticed a pout forming on Jean's usually paralysed face.\n\n____\n\n\"Matron Reva, please look at me,\" Marie pleaded with a defeated smile.\n\n\"I have no time for ungrateful brats,\" Grace snapped. \"Get out!\"\n\nMarie ignored Grace's warning and forcefully hugged Grace from behind. \"Where can I go? You're all I have, you know.\"\n\nGrace clicked her tongue and reprimanded lightly, \"Your sweet words won't save you this time!\"\n\n\"I know, it's all my fault. Teacher Larks admonished me about it already.\"\n\n\"Ha! Don't think you're free just because of his gentle wrist slap,\" Grace scoffed. \"I ought to give you a piece of my mind.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Marie acquiesced while nuzzling lovingly into Grace's shoulder.\n\nGrace opened her mouth and tried to speak, but the words failed her. Finally, she sighed in resignation and asked with a faint hint of hope in her voice, \"Can you stop cultivating, Marie? For me?\"\n\n\"Why?\" Marie asked back with an innocent inflexion.\n\n\"It's just... Mages are so detached and difficult. They don't care about anything else but themselves. They'll do anything to get ahead... ANYTHING,\" Grace's voice grew increasingly heated as it reached a charged crescendo. \"I just don't want you to become like them.\"\n\nMarie frowned and responded, \"Markus isn't like that. Neither is Teacher Larks.\"\n\n\"They... Fine, I'll give you that,\" Grace answered with a bitter smile. \"But they're an exception. Every other mage I've met-\"\n\nGrace caught herself before any more dour words rolled out of her mouth.\n\n\"You shouldn't have to worry about that, Matron Reva,\" Marie pointed out gently. \"You raised me, after all. Trust in yourself, and trust in me.\"\n\nGrace pulled the edges of her lips into her cheeks and smiled wryly.\n\n\"Don't worry, Matron. It'll all turn out for the better! I promise,\" Marie added.\n\n\"Right... I trust you,\" Grace responded with a trace of apprehension in her voice, which was missed by Marie.\n\n____\n\n\"Marie, stop dallying outside like that and just come in,\" Guy commented with an exasperated tone.\n\nMarie entered Guy's room with a sly smile.\n\n\"Why don't you just come during classes like normal people, Marie?\" Markus scoffed. \"You're eating into Master's personal time by doing this.\"\n\n\"What are you even doing here? Don't you have anything better to do?\" Marie shot back.\n\n\"Kids, please,\" Guy interjected while palming his forehead. \"Marie, sit. What can I do for you?\"\n\nMarie stuck her tongue out towards Markus as a taunt and collapsed into a cross-legged seating posture next to Guy.\n\n\"So, what's brings you here?\" Guy inquired.\n\n\"Well, here's the deal. I can now observe the waves of fate using my mana sense,\" Marie started. She then proceeded to explain the mechanisms of how she could capture and decipher the waves of fate in detail.\n\n\"The issue lies there. You see, the waves I receive are extremely noisy. There is a multitude of visions and revelations within it that crackle in my mind. I experience everything related to my question all at once,\" Marie concluded.\n\n\"Your Master must have provided a solution to this,\" Markus pointed out.\n\n\"Yes. Basically, he uses a collection of trinkets and tools that are used to divine the most probably outcome,\" Marie expounded. \"By channelling the waves through these divining tools, all the outcomes with a lower probability of occurrence are essentially overpowered. BUT, the result from these tools isn't descriptive. They only provide a kind of spread or pattern that can be deciphered empirically. It is not definitive in any way.\"\n\n\"But the method IS defined, and your Master was willing to teach it to you?\" Markus clarified.\n\n\"Yes, but-\"\n\n\"Marie!\" Markus interrupted. \"Why are you here? I get that since the last time your Master was unwilling to teach you, you had to seek assistance with Master Larks. But that is a nonissue in this case. Mage Nara specifically offered you the tools AND the expertise.\"\n\n\"It's not accurate enough,\" Marie responded while shaking her head blankly. \"What if two different spreads happen to coincide with each other when in fact there are minute differences?\"\n\n\"That's just selfish, Big Sis, and disrespectful. You're technically two-timing on your Master with mine,\" Markus declared. \"Can't you go through all of this with your own Master?\"\n\n\"I tried, but he is extremely close-minded and incapable of entertaining contradicting thoughts and ideas,\" Marie declared. \"I'm only asking for an open platform for discussion and debate.\"\n\n\"I think your idea of an open discussion and debate might be a bit too... charged for your Master's taste,\" Markus muttered with a chuckle. Marie threw him an offensive glare before turning to Guy with a hopeful expression.\n\n\"So, Teacher Larks. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach this?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-143]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":76,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 141 - Telegraphing with the Universe","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nMarie's life was fairly monotonous since that day. Every morning, she would venture into her Master's cottage and exert her mana sense to observe the waves of fate around her. She was warned earlier that doing so outside the cottage would result in a fierce backlash, and that she had to practice to control it under a thoroughly controlled environment. The plan was to incrementally loosen the stringency of the isolating ritual lined along the cottage walls to raise Marie's resistance organically.\n\nThis exercise lasted for another month, during which time Marie gradually learned more about what the waves of fate represented.\n\n\"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction,\" Krish started. \"It does not just apply to the science of physics that you're learning with Teacher Larks, it also applies to life in general. The things that people do influences the world in one way or another. A large action or even a multitude of small actions, when accumulated, can warrant a large reaction from the world. And waves of fate track this interaction.\"\n\n\"I have a question,\" Marie interjected. \"Master has stated before that the events that will transpire in this world are premeditated. Doesn't that mean that our actions and the subsequent reactions are inconsequential since they occur by design and not by choice?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Krish vocalised. \"I can see how that might get confusing. When I said that the world is premeditated, it refers only to the way the world affects you.\"\n\nMarie hummed in confusion, \"That doesn't make sense. Aren't they the same as what I asked?\"\n\n\"Can a man truly be isolated from the world?\" Krish threw back.\n\n\"Not really. I mean they can try, I guess.\"\n\n\"That's right. No one can separate themselves from the intricate web that binds us together. Even if a man tries to live life inconsequentially, in the grand scheme of things they will play a part, albeit a minor one. In fact, a person can never live an inconsequential life because the world makes it so that their life undergoes trials and tribulations since living itself is a curse.\"\n\n\"That's quite pessimistic,\" Marie muttered.\n\n\"It is the truth! The world seeks to be disordered, yet life is the ordering of matter to create intricate, organic machines. Just this single aberration is enough to disturb the world's grand design. Thus, we as sentient beings must undergo the trials the world throws at us as it attempts to correct itself,\" Krish orated.\n\n\"On that note, divination tells us what the world will do to us as prescribed by our fate. It does not, however, tell us what we will do to face these trials, because that is literally impossible. If I could tell you what you are going to do, you wouldn't do it.\"\n\n\"But it can tell us how our actions will come to affect us?\" Marie chimed in.\n\n\"Bingo!\" Krish congratulated. \"Now you've got the hang of it! In fact, this is the second step in learning divination. You must have noticed that every action done or word spoken, even imperceptible ones, elicit a vibration in your surroundings. These vibrations spread out, but a much smaller wave is reflected. The art of divination works to decipher these reflecting waves.\"\n\n\"How do you do that?\" Marie inquired with a hopeful expression. \"Please don't kick me out like last time.\"\n\n\"HAHAHA! No,\" Krish assuaged her. \"This time we will be working together.\"\n\nAs Marie sighed in relief, Krish reached into his bag and retrieved a set of different divination tools. \"The response you receive as waves are complex and are constituent of multiple, varying information. To interpret them, we use these tools as a medium. Basically, you channel the responding wave through the tool of choice and observe how it reacts.\"\n\n\"And then?\" Marie urged with interest.\n\n\"And then, you cross-reference the behaviour of the tool with historic data to determine the answer,\" Krish concluded.\n\n\"That sounds extremely inaccurate and flimsy in my opinion,\" Marie retorted.\n\n\"That's only if you're starting for the first time with an undocumented tool,\" Krish reasoned. \"For example, if you plan to use cowrie shells like me, then you have access to my almanacks that organise most, if not all, possible spreads you can observe with them. The same applies for divining sticks that my Master used, these dice, and so on.\"\n\n\"So?\" Krish asked. \"What do you choose? Do you want to use any of these divining methods, or do you intend to create your own? A word of warning, if you're planning to pioneer your own, then you'll probably have to generate a large data set from scratch.\"\n\nMarie squinted her eye and wore a distressed expression. \"Which of the tools here offers the most accurate reading?\"\n\n\"Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. I use cowrie shells as I find it easier to interpret geometric spreads. My Master's Master preferred dice because he found it easier to cross-reference numerical values with predictions. Ultimately it depends on what you find most suitable,\" Krish explained.\n\n\"Honestly,\" Marie spoke with a flat smile. \"I'm not feeling any of them, you know?\"\n\n\"That's okay,\" Krish shrugged. \"We can work to develop your own method.\"\n\n\"Why can't we read from the response waves directly? Adding these tools as middle-men feels quite finicky.\"\n\nKrish sighed in defeat and conceded a point, \"Why don't you try deciphering one of the response waves yourself. You will understand what I mean.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to explain the exact method to do so. \"If you observe your mana channels using mana sense when tuned to the waves of fate, you should notice channels originating from your palms navigating through your core and towards your brain. Usually, the response waves are directed through the palm, through the core which attunes it, and then out the other to attune the tools. Instead, channel the waves through your core into your brain.\"\n\nMarie nodded and got to work. She started by first tuning her mana sense to determine the indicated mana channel. The human hands are one of the most sensitive parts of their bodies because they are packed with a myriad of nerve endings and blood vessels that enable high-precision sensing. Coincidentally, a lot of mana channels in the body also open up near the palms and hands (as well as at the base of the foot). Like her Master had described, she found the ones that moved from palms to the core to the brain. Next, she asked a throwaway question, \"Will the sunset in Twilight Village occur earlier today than yesterday?\"\n\nAs the sentence exited her mouth, a wave with a large magnitude emanated and travelled into the distance. After a short while, the response wave arrived with lower intensity. Marie intercepted the wave through one palm. The moment it contacted the mana channel, a tingling feeling started to course through her along the channel. Marie carefully directed the feeling towards her core where an imperceptible change occurred. After that, she diverted it towards her brain.\n\nWhen the wave arrived at its destination, a series of grainy and noisy sensations attacked all of her senses. It wasn't painful like her previous attempt to open up her senses to everything. It felt more like she was experiencing many events all at once. After a short minute, which somehow felt much longer, the sensation dissipated.\n\n\"Do you understand now?\" Krish asked. \"The response wave contains all the possible 'reactions' to your action, which was the question. It is impossible, at your level and cultivation realm, to decipher the messages contained within.\"\n\n\"Are you able to decipher them directly?\" Marie responded.\n\n\"The moment I awakened The Heavenly Eye, I no longer needed to decipher them. The Eye tells me everything that can be divined, and more, directly. Why would I need to bother with the intermediaries as you so rightfully pointed out before?\"\n\n\"There has to be a way!\" Marie declared steadfastly.\n\n\"Why are you wasting your time with this?\" Krish reasoned. \"You should barrel through this stage and quickly awaken The Heavenly Eye, like me.\"\n\n\"But as you've said, The Heavenly Eye is a perilous tool that could hurt the user if used recklessly. However, divination is not dangerous. So, if divination can be made close to as precise as The Heavenly Eye, then I will no longer have to worry about making mistakes with The Heavenly Eye,\" Marie responded.\n\n\"That's a logical conclusion, however, it is impossible to do so,\" Krish said while shaking his head.\n\nMarie simply clicked her tongue and derided her Master, \"This is your problem, you know? You've lived for so long that you assume you've seen everything there is and are quick to deny any possibility of ideas contrary to your beliefs.\"\n\nKrish was about to respond when Marie simply stood up and prepared to leave, \"Forget it! I'll just figure it out by myself... like always.\"\n\nAnd with those parting words, Marie rushed out of the cottage without a second thought. Krish exhaled with amusement at this sight. Before storing away the items in front of him, Krish opened his eyes, revealing a golden glow emanating from them. After a short second, his pupils lost their golden lustre, then his eyes widened in surprise. A pregnant pause invaded the already silent room, during which a mellowed and proud smile cracked across his face.\n\n\"I guess it IS possible, huh?\" Krish extended his mana sense to follow his Disciple excitedly prancing up the steps to the orphanage and smiled bitterly. \"I am just a Master in name. I don't think I have the capacity to teach her anything at all.\"\n\nHe hummed to himself and commented offhandedly, \"Maybe I should apprentice under Guy and learn how to teach.\"\n\nHe chuckled at that thought, and gradually entered a deep meditative state.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-142]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":77,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 140 - Success Over the Horizon","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nKrish gently waved his free hand, casting a spell circle centred on Marie's head. Through Guy's mana sense, he observed imperceptible changes occurring on her riddled brain, slowly bringing it back to a rosy, healthy state.\n\nRight as the spell circle subsided, Krish tapped his walking stick on the floor, causing Marie to rise and levitate in mid-air. He turned around and started to hobble away, but was immediately stopped by Grace's bellowing voice.\n\n\"Where are you taking her?!\"\n\nKrish turned and faced the woman, who in turn shrank and scuttled behind Guy in fear.\n\n\"I am her Master. She is my responsibility, just as much as she is yours. So, I am taking her to recuperate,\" Krish explained.\n\n\"Wait!\" Guy interjected. \"I need an explanation. Anything at all. Why couldn't you have helped her? You KNOW just how dangerous trial-and-error-magic can be, yet you let her - your Disciple - go through with it? I hope you realise just how callous and irresponsible this is.\"\n\nKrish stared directly at Guy with a pensive gaze. Although Krish wasn't manipulating mana in any way, a growing pressure started to bear down on Guy. It was purely through the man's presence and aura alone.\n\n\"You assume that every Master-Disciple relationship works the same as yours,\" Krish commented.\n\n\"I do not. BUT, I assumed that you, Mage Nara, would be different. I thought that Mage Nara would be better. I guess I thought wrong,\" Guy added with a dejected frown.\n\nAfter another silent yet charged minute, Krish sighed and reached into the satchel hanging over his shoulders. From within, he retrieved a booklet and tossed it towards Guy.\n\n\"So far, there is only ONE guaranteed way to become sensitive to the waves of fate. It was the technique my Master taught me, his Master to him, and so on,\" Krish started.\n\nGuy furrowed his brows and quickly flipped through the booklet. With every page turned, his gaze grew increasingly agitated.\n\n\"You should now understand why I chose this method,\" Krish reasoned.\n\nGrace peeked from behind Guy and tugged his jacket, \"W-What does it say?\"\n\n\"I-It...\" Guy bit his lips tensely before explaining. \"To awaken the mage's sensitivity towards the waves of fate, the Master must forcefully suppress the Disciple's natural sensors, leaving them with only their mana sense. Then, the Master must pelt the Disciple with damaging attacks from random directions that must become increasingly fatal over time. The Disciple must naturally gain a sensitivity to these attacks to form a sort of precognitive ability by becoming perceptive to the waves of fate flowing around them.\"\n\nGuy shuddered in just imagining the torturous process described within the booklet. In many ways, people can only affirm their existence through their senses. A person's reality is asserted solely by what their senses capture. In other words, if one's reality is a painting, the senses provide us with the colours to bring vibrancy to it. However, if one lacks all forms of their basic senses, not only will their reality lack colour, it will also lack form, or structure.\n\nSo, when someone is denied all of their senses, they enter a juxtaposing state of existential non-existence. Internally, they recognise that they are present and alive, but they are unable to verify this belief due to the lack of supporting external data. It is easy for someone to enter a heightened panicked state at this time. It would be truly grim to subject someone undergoing this torture to a battery of possibly fatal attacks!\n\n\"My Master literally broke me and reconstructed me, multiple times, for at least two months before I was able to sense the waves of fate around me. I didn't want Marie to suffer as I did, but I didn't know how to go about it. But then my Heavenly Eye saw something! It saw you and her working together and so I had to let her venture by herself,\" Krish smiled faintly \n\n\"Why didn't you just tell her right away? You could have told her the method instead of having her flounder like that,\" Guy retorted.\n\n\"I couldn't do that. I would be changing the sequence of fate,\" Krish spoke. \"Her actions had an effect that may or may not be evident right now, but what she learned through her experimentation will eventually help her in the future. It's like this: In attempting something new, people often make mistakes and learn from them. These titbits that are the by-products of these mistakes can sometimes come to use at a later date. If I didn't let Marie make mistakes, I would be robbing her of expertise down the line.\"\n\n\"Besides-\" Krish said while glancing at Markus, \"If I had intervened, I would have robbed someone else of an opportunity to advance in their cultivation.\"\n\n\"Nonetheless,\" Krish said with a resolute tone before pulling the levitating Marie along, \"I came here to retrieve my Disciple. I shall return her once she has recuperated. Do not disturb us!\"\n\nAs Krish's figure receded, an awkward silence lingered in the room.\n\n\"G-Guy? Marie!\" Grace muttered with a shaking voice. Guy noticed that she was actually, visibly wavering in a panicked state. Her eyes were enlarged with a blank gaze, and she was sweating excessively. Her breath was hurried - she was hyperventilating. Grace was undergoing a full-blown panic attack.\n\nGuy immediately grabbed her and pulsed his mana through the woman's body to forcefully regulate her breathing. He pulled her into a gentle embrace and calmly patted her back, slowly lulling Grace into a stable unconscious state.\n\n\"Markus! Jean!\" Guy called out. \"Help me take Grace back to her room, please.\"\n\nThe two kids nodded immediately, and one ran out to Grace's room while the other assisted Guy by fanning Grace as she was transported.\n\nAfter laying Grace down on her mattress, Guy remained vigil for a while next to her. As he did so, he suddenly noticed a slight stirring surging from his core.\n\n\"It worked?\" He muttered in surprise.\n\nBy experience, he knew that when using The Church's facilities to imprint insights into his students, if the student managed to assimilate them successfully, it would trigger his cultivation. The fact that he was being stimulated right now indicated that Marie had gained some insight through that treacherous experience. Whether the insight was relevant to her quest or not, Guy wasn't sure.\n\nAs he rode the stimulation, Guy's cultivation rose slightly. It still wasn't enough to push him over to the Internal stage of Foundation Establishment, but he could feel that he was nearing it. Along with the boost, Guy also received a small influx of data about Marie directly into his mind. Once again, it was in a cryptic form that somehow made complete sense to him. Unsurprisingly, the contents of this influx was primarily information Guy already surmised about the girl, vis-a-vis her adversarial nature. It also highlighted the irony in her character, given her natural affinity with an abstract subject such as Mathematics AND her general aversion to abstract schools of thought such as philosophy and the arts.\n\n____\n\nMarie's eyes burst open causing a sudden barrage of light to assault her visual senses.\n\n\"Ah!\" She exclaimed and blinked vigorously as she tried to get accustomed to her sight, which was suspiciously more perceptive than before.\n\n\"What in the...\" She muttered. It wasn't just her sight, her hearing had also become a bit more sensitive than before. Things sounded louder all of a sudden.\n\n\"Congratulations! You've advanced to the Middle stage of Mana Condensation realm,\" a sagely voice informed from behind her. Marie twisted in place following the source of the sound and was shocked to see her Master seated next to her.\n\n\"You!\"\n\n\"Where's the respect?\" Krish snorted.\n\nMarie snorted back in derision and corrected herself sarcastically, \"Master.\"\n\n\"Hmph! You should be grateful that I saved you before your brain turned into mush! What were you thinking? Doing something so crazy?\"\n\n\"What choice did I have? Not like you- Master Nara offered anything useful?\"\n\n\"That is true. Nonetheless, you did succeed just like I predicted!\"\n\n\"Predicted? Oh, please! You barely- Wait! Succeed?\"\n\n\"That's right! You've passed the first, and greatest, hurdle,\" Krish reaffirmed with a faint smile.\n\nAt that moment, Marie steadied herself and became more conscious of her surroundings. He extended her mana sense and started to cycle through her perception. First, she noticed that the range of her mana sense was incrementally higher, indicative of her advancement through a small realm. That didn't excite her as much as she had hoped though. What did excite her, was her sudden perceptiveness to a novel phenomenon transpiring around her.\n\n\"This!\" Her eyes sparkled with elation.\n\n\"Do you feel it?\" Krish inquired. \"What do you observe it as?\"\n\n\"It's so... weird!\" Marie commented. \"Woah!\" Marie's eyes darted around. \"Woah! What's happening?! It's literally like a wave! HAHAHAHAHA!\"\n\nMarie laughed hysterically with wonderment oozing in her voice.\n\nFrom her point of view, when observing the so-called waves of fate through her mana sense, the world appeared silhouetted containing uncoloured, three-dimensional models of the surrounding objects. Intermittently, dispersing waves originated from these objects and spread outwards spherically, merging into the serene surroundings, before a nearly imperceptible wave reflected and collided against the source object. When she moved her hands, the waves generated were much more vigorous compared to when it was stationary. This was also the case when she spoke out loud.\n\n\"It's pretty... quiet,\" Marie commented. \"I expected to be noisier given how, according to Master, the world is heavily influenced by these waves of fate.\"\n\n\"That's because this is isolated,\" Krish commented while pointing towards strategic corners in the room. As Marie directed her gaze there, she noticed that some surrounding waves were being sucked in towards points. \"I've lined ritual formations around the cottage that essentially turns it into a vacuum chamber against waves of fate.\"\n\n\"You can do that?!\" Marie exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, child. This is just the beginning,\" Krish responded with a mysterious drawl in his voice.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-141]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":78,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 139 - Sensory Manipulation","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy was having some trouble in figuring out what exactly to \"show\" Marie through The Church's |Soul Imprint| functionality. In the previous demonstrations with his Student and Disciple, the task was much easier because he simply had to emulate the scenarios based on how they were perceived by the senses. What did the eyes see, what did the ears hear, what did the skin feel, what did the nose smell? These were easy questions to answer.\n\nBut, that was also where the problem lied. His task right now was to transmit everything he could perceive through his mana sense to Marie, yet how could he describe it in the first place? Sure, he could translate the information received through the mana sense that could be interpreted by his existing sensors, but what about the information beyond that, which couldn't?\n\nThis also brought up the question of sensory biases and how that would affect any solution he could come up with. It wasn't guaranteed that everyone would observe the colour blue the same way, so what guarantee was there that whatever Guy observed through his use of the ability matched Marie's?\n\nThis was an inherent disadvantage that people faced even back in Guy's previous world. In an attempt to address it, scientists ventured to develop standardised units of measurements that could describe data consistently regardless of the observer. For instance, two people may have differing opinions of the colour blue, but a spectral analysis of the light reflected by a blue surface can quantitatively describe the extent of its blueness. \n\nThe standardisation of measurement has also been attempted in this world, albeit not to such a satisfactory degree as in Guy's previous world. That is, standard measures for length, time, mass, and temperature were ubiquitous, primarily because they were used regularly by the common mortal folk. However, for the more arcane and lesser-known quantities such as energy, force, charge, and so on, things got a little sketchy. Because these quantities were mostly observed by mages, there was a lack of sufficient standardisation - things were more subjective.\n\n\"My master defined heat on a scale of 1-100, where 1 is the heat of boiling water and 100 is the heat of the Sun's surface,\" for example - wholly subjective, and definitely not transferable.\n\nGuy openly disdained the progress of technology in this world. Given that people had access to mana, a literal cheat-like existence, civilisation should have progressed to realms beyond what humans had achieved on Earth. Yet, even though the current civilisation had existed for at least twice as long as the one from Guy's world, they had accomplished diddly-squat.\n\nIt appeared as though the existence of mana had essentially created a brain drain. The set of people that were veritable geniuses largely intersected with the set of people that displayed great control over mana and showed compatibility with certain cultivation styles. As these geniuses gained strength and transcended their mortality, they grew detached from the mortals they deemed beneath them. For one they would outlive their loved ones, who tethered them to their mortality. In the end, they viewed mortals as a completely different species.\n\nHumans advance through shared struggle. The geniuses that could push civilisation forward no longer struggled with the common folk, and thus did not have any motivation to oblige. Therefore, the mortal civilisations stagnated - but what stopped the mage congregations from leaping forward? The geniuses were all there, after all.\n\nThere is a common saying in Guy's previous world that, \"One mountain cannot contain two tigers.\" As geniuses ascended, they inevitably clashed against each other at the peak in fighting for resources. By publicising advancements, one basically presented their hand to the world thus losing any advantages they held in a confrontation. No one wanted to do that.\n\nHence, the world stagnated. The status quo endured.\n\nAs a transmigrator, Guy felt obligated to change this. But, he also recognised that as a solo entity, he didn't have any power in the matter. Sure, he could play his hand like how most other typical transmigrants did from the fiction works in his past life. He could output a steady stream of modern devices into the world, amass a large amount of wealth and a steady power-base, live a gala life. But as an educator, Guy immediately recognised the folly of that endeavour, in that he was just one person. How much could one person accomplish? \n\nThere was another common saying in Guy's previous world, \"Give a man a fish and feed him for a day, teach a man how to fish and feed him for a lifetime.\" His impact would be greater if he was the catalyst that evoked change from within, rather than an anomaly that brought change without.\n\nBut those were just Guy's distant aspirations. His current struggle was already giving him a massive headache. Ultimately, Guy hypothesised that since he couldn't properly decipher the data his mana sense captured, barring the once he could decrypt using his human sensors, Marie should also be experiencing the same kind of noise using her mana sense. So, if Guy and Marie were to isolate the decipherable data from the noise, the noisy data should overlap except for a single set corresponding to the mana waves that only Marie could observe.\n\nAfter Marie was sucked into the darkness of the dark screen, her Teacher's calm voice resounded around her.\n\n\"Do you think you can isolate what you perceive through your senses?\" Guy started. He then went on to describe exactly what he expected Marie to do, which she nodded doubtfully.\n\n\"I haven't tried it before. But I don't believe that it will be hard,\" Marie affirmed.\n\nAlthough Marie felt like she was in a different place, she could still \"sense\" the same environment from before. It was like she was displaced and stationary at the same time. Therefore, using her experience she started to release her mana sense.\n\nThis time she didn't experience the same splitting headache that caused her to keel over. Weeks of excruciating practise had helped her build up an immunity. What level of damage did this self-afflicting practice inflict on her mind? She didn't know, and for the time being, she didn't care.\n\nMarie had foreseen the need for manipulating the sensory data observed through her mana sense. After all, she had to somehow filter out the waves of fate from the background noise and to do that she needed a few proficiencies. With that said, she didn't face much difficulty filtering out the known sensory data.\n\n\"I'm able to do it,\" Marie signalled.\n\n\"Alright then. Prepare yourself. I will begin the transfer in ten seconds, starting now!\" Guy declared.\n\nMarie immediately reverted to her hypersensitive state with her mana senses flaring. Without her hearing, smell, taste, sight and touch sensory data, she waited in anticipation.\n\nMarie was in what could be described as a sensory deprivation chamber of her own design. The only thing stopping her from going insane at this point was the bearable pain resonating within her mind.\n\nThen, suddenly, the pain in her head started to swell up at an accelerated pace. She realised that it was the onslaught of her Teacher's senses.\n\nIt was hard; the attack from the new influx of noisy data overtook her self-control and nearly caused her to lose consciousness. She quickly shook herself from her painful trance, grit her teeth and scrambled to action.\n\nThe filter Marie planned to use was by reflecting the noise transmitted into her head by her Teacher. She would then use the principles of superposition to overlay the noise which was originally in her head over this reflected noise, to isolate the waves of fate. It was a simple description on paper.\n\nBut how does one reflect unintelligible noise? It all came down to a matter of perspective.\n\nTeacher Larks often told her that human senses are clouded by their perception of the world itself. We see what we want to see, hear what we want to hear. In essence, the human mind could affect what the senses capture. Using this reasoning, Marie wondered if she could implement this paradigm with her mana senses.\n\nTo an extent, she succeeded. Early on during practice, Marie bundled up the noise captured by her mana senses into an abstract package that she called a time-dependent function. In her mind, the noise turned into an n-dimensional function, where 'n' referred to the near-infinite dependent variables contained within the noise, which all varied with the independent variable: time. It was a flimsy implementation, yet for a short few seconds, it worked! Her mind couldn't physically fathom the n-th dimension, so the paradigm collapsed due to instability. It also gave Marie a massive headache, on top of the already existing one due to the constant abuse of her mana sense. But within that short duration, Marie managed to implement a reflection operation! She then proceeded to test this a few more times to confirm that it was legitimate.\n\nShe followed those steps at present and reflected the noise from Teacher Larks' transmission. As she did so, her mind started to physically and perceptively undulate under the stress. Marie even started to bleed through her nose and ears.\n\nImmediately after she confirmed that the reflection was successful, she proceeded to convert her own perceived noise into a function. This operation exacerbated the situation further. Marie's mind was on the verge of a physical meltdown.\n\nWithout wasting another second, Marie quickly overlaid the two functions through a summation.\n\n\"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!\" Marie screamed as she was pulled out of The Church forcefully. Guy immediately rushed forward and straddled her in his arms.\n\n\"Marie!\" He shook her lightly. He tapped her cheeks and brought his ears close to her chest. He sighed in half-relief after noticing that she was still alive.\n\n\"What happened?!\" Grace rushed in. \"M-Marie! What did you do to her?\"\n\n\"I-I-\" Guy stumbled on his words. He regretted everything. He shouldn't have gone through with it. He should have stopped her!\n\nGrace rushed towards the unconscious girl and burst into panicked tears. She grabbed Guy by his collars and started to shake him in a fit, \"You! What did you do?!\"\n\nGuy mumbled blankly. Around this time, others present at the orphanage started to gather as well. Markus and Jean looked concerned, although the latter didn't show it on her face. Dora was playing around in the woods, so she was absent.\n\nNoticing Grace's agitated and near deflated state, Guy hoped to explain the situation. Just as he was about to speak, a forceful voice broke through the din.\n\n\"She's fine.\"\n\nGuy turned towards the door and noticed an old man with a stick in his hands, gazing calmly at the unconscious Marie.\n\n\"\"\"\"M-Mage Nara!\"\"\"\" Everyone exclaimed in unison.\n\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-140]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":79,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 138 - Sensing Everything","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Umm,\" Marie vocalised while twiddling her fingers embarrassedly. \"I-I didn't...\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Guy said with a light cough. \"I understand. You were just excited - no harm done.\"\n\n\"No, I mean-\" Marie tried. \"I wasn't...\"\n\n\"Look, Marie, there are at least five years between us. I'm as old as Grace. It's fine,\" Guy continued his explanation with a warm smile.\n\nMarie eyed Guy's expressions carefully and sighed in relief upon realising that her hasty and impulsive actions weren't misconstrued. She too was quite surprised at her emotional outburst, which took place for the first time in her life. It wasn't an action brought on by attraction; her opinion of Teacher Larks wasn't skewed in that sense. She didn't know what possessed her to do it, but the emotions she felt after doing it, albeit for barely a short second, washed her with a sense of comfort and gratitude.\n\nMarie then snapped her head and glared forcefully at Markus, who was struggling to hide a mischievous smile. The two had lived together long enough to understand the hidden implication in each other's gazes, and right now it looked like Markus was just eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to spill everything he had seen to the others in the orphanage. With a tactful scowl, Marie transmitted, 'If you tell anyone, I will chop you into a million pieces,' which caused Markus to shrink into his body in fear.\n\n\"You need to prepare yourself,\" Guy instructed, shifting the stagnant conversation forward. \"Let's start meditating.\"\n\nWith that, the Teacher and Student started the process. Guy had already tailored a fitting sequence of poses for Marie to follow when practising Yoga. With familiarity, the duo commenced with a simple cross-legged posture to centre their breathing. There was sufficient space within the room to accommodate the duo as well as Markus who was, at this point, squashed into a corner with his head lowered in his book.\n\nGradually, the ambience within the room started to enter a pleasant standstill.\n\nEventually, Marie managed to enter a steady meditative state, at which point Guy added, \"Extend your mana sense to one per cent of its maximum range.\"\n\nMarie's experience with mana control was very limited. It took her nearly an hour of steady mana manipulation to achieve the one per cent limit Teacher Larks had set for her. After she managed to hold the mana sense stably, Teacher Larks said, \"Now, open up your mana sense to its maximum capacity. Become receptive to everything that the sensor captures. Hold it for no more than half a second!\"\n\nShe followed as instructed, however, she immediately faced difficulty as she attempted to open up her receptivity. Although it sounded simple in instruction, the process was extremely complicated because its basis was beyond mortal understanding. For comparison, a human is limited to their five basic senses. They know what the senses are open to, and how to interpret this information. Since humans do not know what exists beyond the limits of these five senses, it is often difficult for mages to absorb information through mana sense that is foreign to their mortal senses. This was the barrier Marie was currently colliding against.\n\n\"Do not think of the mana sense as a part of you. The more you think of it as such, the less you will perceive. Hence, do not actively focus on what the mana sense captures,\" Guy pointed out.\n\nMarie processed this new set of instructions and gradually loosened her vigilance. Incrementally, the extended sensory data she kept receiving started to blend into an incomprehensible mush. Then, out of nowhere, an inhuman quantity of what can only be classified as illogical gibberish assaulted Marie's mind causing her to reel over in pain and get thrown out of her meditative state.\n\n\"AAAAH!\" Marie evoked while grasping her head tightly.\n\nMarkus immediately rushed forward with concern showing on his face but was immediately stopped by a monotone and firm command from his Master, \"Don't agitate her. She needs to recuperate by herself.\"\n\nMarie rolled on the ground like a salted slug, pulling at her hair from its scalps. Just a fraction of a second's worth of exposure to everything that radiated around her had put her in such a sorry state. She shuddered internally as she pondered over what would happen if she were to allow double this pressure to bear down on her. For a moment, a part of her subconsciously urged her to give up immediately, yet the doubt was immediately doused by the force of her unbending will. She had to go through with it, to the bitter end.\n\nGuy exited his meditative state and helped Marie up after the pain had passed. Within the short moment, she had become as dishevelled as someone who had undergone days' worth of torture. With an apologetic and dejected tone, Guy said, \"Take the day off. Since you've set your mind to it, try to start building up resistance to this process. Do not be foolhardy and push yourself beyond your limits. Look at what happened to you now!\"\n\nMarie nodded and prepared to leave, but was immediately caught by Guy who then propped her against himself and helped her walk. \"I'll take you to your room.\"\n\nMarkus darted up and immediately intercepted them. \"Master, let me!\" to which Guy readily complied.\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Markus inquired in a low voice as he helped Marie to her room. \"Why are you putting yourself through all this?\"\n\nMarie lifted her face slowly and muttered with a wavering tone, \"Family must be protected. At all costs!\"\n\n\"Why do you have to be the one? Huh!\" Markus challenged angrily. \"Let me! Wasn't this the reason you sent me to the Academy?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Marie answered weakly. \"I was being too selfish. It should have been me. You've suffered a lot, Markus.\"\n\nMarkus controlled his swelling emotions and pushed down the sudden urge to bawl. \"Look. I'm strong now. I can handle it, I promise!\"\n\n\"I know. I believe you. But I don't want you to be alone,\" Marie said with finality in her voice. Markus frowned in dismay and didn't continue the conversation.\n\n____\n\nIn the following weeks, Marie entered a frenzied state of diligently practising the process of exposing her mana sense to everything around her, much to Grace's dissatisfaction. Observing Marie walk around in shambles discomfited Grace greatly, and she had constantly accosted Guy verbally regarding this. It wasn't like Guy could do anything about it besides bearing with the abuse. Guy was also bothered by the way Krish handled this situation and was equally interested in confronting the man about it. But he was powerless to do anything, lest he angers someone who could extinguish them all with a single snap.\n\nThe days passed like this, with a charged atmosphere prevailing during dinner times, until one day, Marie walked in with a satisfied smile on her face. Guy knew straight away that the girl had made some progress\n\n\"Are you ready for the next step?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"As ready as I will ever be, Teacher Larks,\" Marie answered flatly and then, without wasting any more time, the two tacitly entered a meditative state through Yoga.\n\nGuy followed his usual method of |Introspect| to access his core. The area was exactly the same as before, reminiscent of a bright, isolated room from a mental health institution with an out-of-place elevation leading to a mirror-like, unperturbed liquid pool. Upon entry, Guy quickly dove through the membranous surface and entered The Church.\n\nHere, Guy observed a few glaring differences from his previous extensive visit. For one, the figures of Jean and Marie had gained greater clarity, the former more than the latter. This was primarily because Jean had successfully entered the Middle stage of Mana Condensation realm a while back and was reaching the cusp of breaking through to the Late stage. The rate of her advancement to this stage, which was approximately three months, was starkly faster than Markus'. This was primarily due to the ampler access to resources she enjoyed compared to the boy. Having the force of a renowned and wealthy clan backing her, the girl had access to a nigh endless supply of mana crystals, mana replenishing potions, body rejuvenation and reinforcement potions, internal cleansing potions, and so on, which Markus lacked.\n\nMarkus was a little jealous of Jean, which was a natural response. But it was only a fleeting emotion. The boy had matured vastly through the past few years and understood that feeling jealous of the luck and privilege of others was futile. One had to make do with the hand one was dealt, and Markus was satisfied with his efforts as he recognised that he had done his best. Besides, since his Junior Sister was exclusively his Master's student, he was also awarded the same benefits. Nowadays, Markus didn't have to scrounge and save up his mana crystals and potions either.\n\nMarie, on the other hand, had only just reached the peak of the Early stage of Mana Condensation realm. Her journey was much more orthodox compared to Markus and Jean's, and since she was perfectly attuned to her cultivation method, her advancement was smooth and generally faster.\n\nGuy approached her ethereal figure and grasped it, pulling the girl into The Church.\n\n\"Wha- Where?\" Marie exclaimed as she felt herself within a foreign space all of a sudden. \"Ah! So this is the place...\" she muttered after relaxing her nerves.\n\nThis was Marie's first time in The Church. She had only heard through Markus and Jean how it felt like, and she was excited to witness it herself. Except, she was too embarrassed to ask Teacher Larks to take her into this space as it wasn't a trivial trick that he could pull out anytime someone wanted, and it would also be disrespectful.\n\n\"Look over there,\" Guy said while pointing behind the dais, where a large black screen had descended.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-139]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":80,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 137 - Problem? Solution!","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"That... complicates things,\" Guy muttered.\n\nMarie sighed in exasperation and said, \"Do you see what I mean?! No matter what solution we come up with, it is useless if we can't detect the waves of fate. And to do that is literally impossible!\"\n\nMarkus hummed lightly before saying, \"There has to be a way. Mage Nara wouldn't hand you an impossible task.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't he, though?\" Marie scoffed. \"I bet he is just taking out his frustrations on me. I knew he didn't like me. He's hoping to see me suffer and then crawl back and admit defeat.\"\n\n\"You should probably do that,\" Markus chuckled. \"I don't think we will make any progress like this.\"\n\n\"No! Absolutely not!\" Marie retorted vehemently. \"Teacher Larks. You've gotta help me,\" she then pleaded.\n\n\"I-\" Guy started. \"Look, this is really beyond my knowledge. I don't know how to help you, although I really wish that I could. If you have any idea, I'll give you my complete support.\"\n\nMarie exhaled in dejection and agreed with a despondent shrug.\n\n\"Why don't you spend some time away from the problem? Leave it for the time being, maybe walk around the village, play with the kids? Do anything to divert your mind. Tomorrow, return to the problem after some meditation. A clearer, less cluttered mind may spark some inspiration.\" Guy suggested.\n\nMarie nodded forlornly and left the room. She navigated through the hallways of the orphanage and returned to her bedroom. Although it was just a little past twilight, Marie was feeling immensely exhausted. It may have been her earlier mental gymnastics in trying to decipher her Master's vague teachings that had drained her completely. She would have remained taut if not for her earlier consultation with Teacher Larks. Although it didn't lead to anything productive, it did somehow alleviate some of the stress bubbling inside her.\n\nAfter she entered her room, Marie immediately removed her excess clothing and plopped down on her floor mattress. Her head fell upon her new duck-feather pillow, descending gradually, pulling her gently into a deep albeit tense sleep. She slept through dinner, much to Grace's chagrin.\n\nThe next morning, Marie arose like clockwork half an hour before sunrise. She went through her morning rituals in a state of detached autonomy. She actively tried to dissuade her mind from reverting and preoccupying itself with the monumental task ahead of her, just like Teacher Larks had instructed. After taking a quick, cold shower, Marie caught a quick breakfast and hurried outside to begin her meditation through Yoga.\n\n\"Big Sis! Big Sis!\" Dora caught Marie right as Marie left the orphanage.\n\n\"Dora?\"\n\n\"Big Sis, Medium Sis and I are going to sieve the stream for medicine!\" Dora exclaimed energetically as she grabbed Marie's hand.\n\n\"What?\" Marie asked with a squint.\n\n\"*cough* It's to collect beneficial particle run-offs from the stream,\" Jean explained. \"Dora found out recently that upstream there is a substantial Metal-Shell Beatle territory. These insects thrive in regions with high metal constitutions and process metal ores by consuming them to reinforce their exoskeletons. The shedding from their highly-processed exoskeletons and their excrement is extremely valuable as alchemy catalysts. Large quantities of this can be obtained by slaying these creatures, but they are difficult to combat due to their swarming behaviour. Thankfully, the Metal-Shell Beatles frequently wash themselves and primarily excrete near flowing streams to keep their territories free of impurities. We can catch the shedding as run-off from the stream.\"\n\n\"I'm kind of busy-\"\n\n\"But Big Sis! You never play with us anymore,\" Dora pouted. \"Please,\" she added while elongating the syllable for as long as she could hold her breath.\n\nMarie smiled wryly under her sister's emotional assault. While she very much wanted to just attack her problem as soon as possible, she figured that distracting herself with this menial task would help clear her mind a little bit. Thus, after a short internal debate, Marie finally acquiesced. \"Okay, okay! But only for a little bit. You Big Sis has a lot of things on her plate right now.\"\n\nDora celebrated excitedly before rushing off in the direction of the stream with a sieve in her hands.\n\nJean and Marie followed the hyperactive little girl, each carrying their own sieves. The equipment was of a simple design - made out of pliable wood bark turned into a closed circle and tied together with rope. A porous cloth was then draped over one side, pulled until taut, and fastened with another length of rope.\n\nThe trio arrived at the stream and positioned themselves in a spaced-out fashion along its breadth such that the water reached halfway between their knees and ankles. Dora was stationed near the bank of the stream for safety, while Jean and Marie waded towards the stream's centre. Then, they periodically lowered and raised the sieve against the flow of water, catching debris and deposits as it flowed downstream. Intermittently, they inspected the sieve and removed unwanted catches such as dead insects, rocks and pebbles, wood shards, and so on.\n\nAt first, Marie wasn't sure what they were looking for in particular. \"Is this it?\" She asked while pointing out a peculiar, lustrous grainy powder caught in the sieve.\n\n\"Yes. After rinsing it you can transfer it to the bucket on the side,\" Jean instructed after giving Marie's sieve a cursory glance.\n\nThis process continued for a while, during which, Marie entered a steady, disconnected trance. The monotony of the whole process had incrementally crept into Marie's mind and had lulled her into a state of quietude.\n\nHer eyes glazed over and focused on the porous, white cloth lining the sieve. As the water flowed through the mesh, the cloth slowly darkened as it captured rogue particles. She inadvertently targeted her mana sense on the mesh and observed as the cloth let some particles, smaller than its pores, through. Were they unimportant?\n\nCapture, deposit, rinse, repeat.\n\nThe exercise in tedium continued for a while and Marie worked continuously, like a robot, without pause. Until suddenly, something sparked inside her. A faint idea, an inspiration, sprouted from the depths of her idle mind and started to surge outwards. Marie's listless eyes started to gain an inspired glitter, and her entire body started to shiver with excitement as she grasped the possibilities this new idea brought with it.\n\n\"I have to go!\" Marie screamed and dashed out of the stream. She tossed the sieve on the grassy patch on the stream's bank and ran back to the orphanage.\n\nHer feet carried her through the woods without stumbling or braking and deposited her in front of Teacher Larks' room once again. Unfortunately, today was an off-day, so she had no choice but to disturb Teacher Larks in his free time. She took a deep breath and prepared to knock.\n\n\"Come in,\" Teacher Larks beckoned before her knuckles could contact the door.\n\nMarie entered excitedly and vocalised her earlier idea, \"Filters! I can filter out the 'waves of fate' from my mana sense.\"\n\n\"Filter? How?\" Markus replied.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Marie retorted in surprise.\n\n\"Studying. Can't you see?\" He said while nudging the book in front of him.\n\nMarie squinted and then immediately shook her head to clear her distracting thoughts. She turned to Guy and repeated, \"I figured out how to detect 'waves of fate'. And that is by filtering out all the other information that is received by a regular mana sense.\"\n\n\"How do you intend to do that?\" Guy inquired with a pensive gaze.\n\nMarie quirked the corners of her lips and said, \"I am going to use what a regular person observes through their mana sense, and filter through it the information that I observe through my mana sense. What remains will be the 'waves of fate'.\"\n\n\"How will you do that?\" Markus interjected.\n\n\"Absolutely not!\" Guy declared immediately.\n\n\"B-But you haven't heard how I'm planning to do it,\" Marie reasoned.\n\n\"I know exactly how you intend to achieve this, and it is because of that that I am against it!\" Guy reaffirmed. \"You plan to have me |Soul Imprint| the information I receive through my mana sense to you while you are exercising your own mana sense, isn't that right?\"\n\nMarie's eyes widened in shock, \"H-How?\"\n\n\"I had the same idea yesterday night. There is a reason why I didn't bring it up with you this morning,\" Guy said. \"Have you ever considered the ramifications of your own proposal?\"\n\n\"I...\" Marie stuttered. \"That's the only option left!\"\n\n\"It's too dangerous,\" Guy declared.\n\n\"Teacher Larks! Please,\" Marie pleaded. \"This is the only way.\"\n\n\"How can you know that? You barely spent a day on this,\" Guy countered.\n\n\"If there is a solution, why must I flounder for alternatives? I can do this, please trust me Teacher Larks,\" Marie implored.\n\n\"Marie...\"\n\n\"Master, if I may?\" Markus interrupted. \"I think you should let her go through with it.\"\n\n\"Markus!\" Guy reprimanded. \n\n\"She must have thought through it. Big Sis isn't someone who takes risky gambles. Master must know her character by now,\" Markus expounded.\n\n\"Markus. Have you ever used your mana sense without a specific target?\"\n\n\"I... haven't...\"\n\n\"You don't know just how excruciating it is. Even a fraction of a second worth of exposure can debilitate you,\" Guy added. \"She's asking me to expose her to not one, but two superimposed mana senses!\"\n\n\"I can do it!\" Marie inserted. She immediately grabbed onto Guy's hand and hugged it tightly. \"Please! Please please please please, pleeeeeaaase!\" She wheedled with a pout.\n\nGuy's lips twitched at the sight of Marie's forced \"cute\" expression. His eyes immediately locked on Markus who was forcing back laughter. Since it ran counter to Marie's character, her current appearance felt extremely jarring. It appeared as though she was copying what Dora would do when she would beg Guy to give her more comics to read.\n\n\"Please, Teacher Larks!\" She begged.\n\nGuy tried to avert his eyes from Marie's passionate pleas. But he wasn't someone who could turn down a student's heartfelt requests, especially Marie who was probably behaving like a child for the first time in her life.\n\n\"Fine...\" Guy finally acquiesced, only to be immediately stamped with an innocent kiss on his cheek.\n\n\"Thank you!\" Marie cried. But then her cloudy mind gained clarity and extreme horror grasped her as she immediately recognised what she had just done.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-138]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":81,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 136 - Group Brainstorming Session","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nThe orphanage had changed. Even before its architecture was overhauled within the recent month, Marie recognised that the dynamic within the orphanage had shifted. Going back a few years, when her family was living under the old yet still sturdy roof of the building, while there was an excess of love and affection coursing in the ambience, there was a stark lack of 'something' that greatly unnerved Marie.\n\nA family is a family only when there is- 'something'... What was it? All that time, Marie figured that the 'something' was love and affection. But even after gaining it, she still felt the absence of 'something'. Was it her greed - the so-called endless void of want hidden within the human psyche - that urged her to seek outwards to address this burgeoning itch? That's what Marie thought it was, and she actively suppressed that growing uneasiness in her heart.\n\n'There is everything I need here,' she would tell herself. 'I have everything I deserve.'\n\nBut then everything changed. Someone new entered her life- entered the family. And with this new addition, the ambience in the house felt suddenly revitalised. It was hard to get used to the presence of this new entity in the family, but their assimilation was nigh flawless - they fit in like a missing puzzle piece. True to that analogy, the new presence brought with them the missing 'something' Marie was looking for.\n\nIt was support.\n\nFor the first time in her life, Marie felt that she could approach someone else with her problems. When she was stuck, when she felt down, when she was unsure, she could approach this new entity and, magically, everything that bothered her would get resolved.\n\nMaybe it was this very reason that her body dragged her to this particular room of the orphanage: the source of the missing 'something' in her life.\n\nAs Marie entered the room, she observed that Teacher Larks wasn't alone. On the corner away from the entrance, Markus was seated with his back resting against the wall and was reading a book placed on a short table in front of him. It was interesting to note that while the room's location hadn't changed much, it had become quite spacious. During the refurbishing spree, most of the rooms in the orphanage had undergone a similar treatment. Now, Marie did not have to share her room with Jean. Nor did the twins. It was slightly jarring to get used to the sudden increase in space and stark lack of company at night, but Marie was definitely growing accustomed to the comfort brought by the privacy.\n\nMarkus raised his head and nodded a greeting towards her, which she reciprocated.\n\n\"Sit, sit!\" Teacher Larks gestured from his desk. He was sitting in a cross-legged pose, the desk reaching right above his folded knees with a slight incline towards him such that he didn't have to arch his back while working.\n\nMarie complied and sat down next to Teacher Larks' desk. \"So? How're the lessons with your Master going?\"\n\nMarie scoffed involuntarily before quickly covering his mouth. She quickly centred herself and explained, \"It's primarily self-studying. If I'm being honest, it's really frustrating. He's like... UGH! Like, this isn't even the first time, you know? With the magic primer sessions too, he just gave me a book about it and let me have at it. If it weren't for the sessions with you, I wouldn't have picked up half of what was prescribed within the time period.\"\n\nShe released her tense spine, collapsed onto the floor on her back and continued venting, \"I'm not asking for much, you know? Besides, he was the one who asked me to become his Disciple. Why can't he treat me like one?\"\n\nAt this point, Markus interrupted, \"Actually, this is usually how a Master-Disciple relationship works, Marie. The Master's responsibility is to primarily pass on their techniques and cultivation arts, it is up to the Disciple to absorb it. Master Larks is just special, I think you should lower your expectations.\"\n\nMarie turned her head and bore down on Markus with an incisive gaze.\n\n\"What? It's a fact!\" Markus reasoned as he alternated his gaze between Marie and Guy. He noticed that Guy was returning a meaningful glance suggesting that he 'keep quiet'.\n\n\"Ignore him,\" Guy beckoned.\n\n\"As I was saying,\" Marie glared once again at Markus before continuing. \"I feel like he can't teach, at all! Maybe, he doesn't even know what he is talking about.\"\n\nGuy chuckled lightly and commented, \"I don't think that's the case.\"\n\n\"*sigh* He did say that this was how his Master taught him and so on. But still, at least he should try, right?\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" Guy sympathised. \"Though you must understand that he is really, really old. It would be like asking a river to flow a different way.\"\n\n\"What else am I supposed to do?!\" Marie exclaimed as she sprang up into a seated position. She immediately snapped her finger and dragged herself closer to Guy. \"Can you help me?\"\n\nAs Guy gazed into Marie's sparkling, pleading eyes, his heart softened. \"I'd be glad to, but I don't think I am allowed to, right?\"\n\nMarie waved her hands and said, \"Whatever! If it's not allowed, my 'Master' in his omniscient capacity would stop me. So can you? Please?\"\n\n'I hope he doesn't decimate me...' Guy prayed internally. After an intense debate with himself, he finally acquiesced. After all, a diligent student's plea for help was his greatest weakness.\n\nMarie clapped enthusiastically and began explaining.\n\n\"That really... does not help us at all,\" Guy sighed.\n\n\"What does it even mean? Waves of fate?\" Markus chimed in. \"Are they like energy? How are they generated?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\" Marie retorted. \"That's why I'm here!\"\n\nMarkus scratched his chin in contemplation before suggesting, \"Have you tried splitting the problem into-\"\n\n\"bite-size modules?\" Marie finished with a smug smile. \"Why don't you try it, huh?\" She goaded.\n\n\"Fighting isn't productive, guys. Nonetheless, even if we do break up this problem, I suspect that we cannot proceed further without determining what these waves of fate are,\" Guy interjected.\n\n\"That was my conclusion as well,\" Marie added. \"But I can't connect it with anything I already know. The other aspects of the problem are known, it's just the waves that are stonewalling me.\"\n\n\"What method did Mage Nara utilise to detect these waves?\" Markus inquired. \"Did he observe them with his eyes?\"\n\nMarie furrowed her brows as she tried to recollect the scene from before. \"No. His eyes were closed.\"\n\n\"Then it has to be either through smell, sound, or touch,\" Markus hypothesised.\n\n\"Why can't it taste?\" Marie challenged.\n\n\"Stop being so willful!\" Markus retorted. \"I doubt that he stuck his tongue out when he divined the weather.\"\n\n\"I'm saying that he could have!\"\n\n\"Did he?\" Markus challenged back.\n\n\"Stop!\" Guy reprimanded.\n\n\"Why are you like this?\" Markus scolded Marie. \"I bet this is why your Master doesn't bother teaching you. You'd just challenge him at every step!\"\n\n\"ENOUGH!\" Guy screamed. He turned to Marie and spoke with a stern voice, \"Do you need help or not?\"\n\n\"I-I do...\"\n\n\"Then stop instigating Markus. Can't you see that he is trying to help?\"\n\n\"B-But I'm just proposing a counterpoint,\" Marie reasoned.\n\n\"Was there a reason behind your counterpoint?\"\n\n\"I mean, he just dropped a possible avenue just through an assumption.\"\n\n\"Was it valid?\" Guy replied. \"Markus is using deductive reasoning to filter out illogical or unnecessary paths to streamline our research. Look, when it comes to things like this we MUST be constructive with our feedback, criticisms and suggestions.\"\n\nMarie nodded at Guy and hummed a low apology to Markus.\n\n\"Back to our discussion. I firmly believe that the way to sense out these 'waves' is through the mana sense,\" Guy proposed.\n\n\"Why is that, Master?\"\n\n\"Mage Nara did not teach Marie any special techniques that alter or augment the human's sensory organs and its perception. He waited till Marie was capable of controlling her internal mana before letting her take the first step in cultivating The Heavenly Eye. That much should be enough to conclude that Marie first required the ability to use her mana in some way.\"\n\nMarkus nodded affirmatively and added, \"I concur, however, we don't know what to look for. Mana sense covers so much ground, how will we be able to narrow down our search?\"\n\nThat point brought pause to the productive discussion. As stated before, the mana sense was akin to a sensor that could read anything and everything that prevailed in the world. One just had to know what they were looking for, what it meant, and how to decipher it. Knowing that these arcane waves of fate could be observed through the mana sense didn't offer anything.\n\n\"We could brute force it,\" Markus suggested. \"Master, myself and Big Sis - we could each work through the various information that comes in through mana sense and filter it out one at a time.\"\n\n\"That isn't tractable. We don't even know what all information CAN be obtained through mana sense,\" Guy countered.\n\n\"And I don't think you guys will even be able to sense it,\" Marie interrupted.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"Well... If everyone could sense it, then why did Master choose me specifically? Why couldn't he have taken just about anyone to continue The Heavenly Eye?\" Marie reasoned. \"I remember him saying that there could only be two of us at a time. What is the factor restricting others from entering the fold?\"\n\n\"So you're saying that-\"\n\n\"I believe that no one else apart from me and Master Nara can observe these waves of fate. Even if you guys try, I don't think that you will detect it,\" Marie concluded solemnly.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-137]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":82,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 135 - Self-Study","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nMarie scratched her chin as she pondered over her question.\n\n\"Hmm... Will it rain tomorrow?\" Marie asked indecisively. Being forced to ask a question all of a sudden flustered her altogether, and that was the best she could come up with.\n\nKrish didn't comment on the hollowness of the question and immediately reached in and pulled out a handful of cowrie shells. He dropped them on the table and waited for them to settle.\n\n\"No,\" he answered firmly after a short second.\n\n\"Wait, what?!\"\n\n\"It won't rain tomorrow,\" Krish reiterated.\n\n\"No- I heard you the first time. I meant, how did you do that?\" Marie interrogated.\n\n\"I did exactly what I told you to do. You observe the waves around you,\" Krish said as he jerked his arms around, \"tether tokens to these waves,\" he said as he pointed at the cowrie shells, \"then you tune them to the information you want to be divined, and observe how the tokens react,\" he concluded while pointing at the spread cowrie shells on the table.\n\nMarie shook her head violently and said, \"Okay, I have a TON of questions. But before that, I remember that when you did this the last time you referred to your almanacks. Why aren't you doing that now?\"\n\n\"That was because the answer asked for greater specificity, and extended a bit over the short term,\" Krish clarified.\n\n\"So your answer that time was purely empirical?\"\n\n\"More or less.\"\n\n\"How is that trustworthy?\"\n\n\"You seem to forget that my 'dataset' is spread out over multiple years and a multitude of people spanning different locations, age groups, and social standings.\"\n\n\"Even still, it's still so random,\" Marie commented. \"Haven't you thought of standardising your results?\"\n\n\"Haven't had to. It works for me, why bother changing it? Anyways, enough of all the chit-chat. Move along now!\"\n\n\"Move where? You still haven't explained to me how to do it,\" Marie pointed out.\n\n\"Hah! That's for you to figure out. Now go, go,\" Krish urged Marie.\n\n\"Excuse me?!\" Marie exclaimed loudly. \"Y-You're my Master. You're supposed to teach me!\"\n\n\"Now you remember that I'm your Master?\" Krish scoffed. \"I've done my part in this relationship. Now it's your turn to do yours and figure out the remainder. This was exactly how my Master taught me, and how his Master taught him.\"\n\n\"But how am I supposed to figure it out if you haven't even gone past the surface level explanation? This is unfair!\"\n\n\"Use the resources you have and your intuition,\" Krish suggested. \"You will figure it out. Let me reiterate that, you WILL figure it out. Maybe you will do it today, maybe this week or the next, next month, next year, next decade, heck maybe even next century- well I hope it's before that, the base human life expectancy doesn't extend for that long,\" Krish muttered.\n\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\n\"Stop shouting, will you?\" Krish groaned as he massaged his ears. \"I've told you that you're fated with The Heavenly Eye. That means that you will figure it out eventually. What point is there in me investing time on trivial lectures if the result can be achieved without any action?\"\n\n\"That-\" made sense. But Marie couldn't accept it as it ran contrary to everything she grew up believing.\n\n\"Enough,\" Krish declared. Without wasting another second, Krish immediately waved his hands and chanted |Displace|. Marie found herself getting suspended midair and displacing backwards right out of Krish' cottage. With an unceremonious plop, Marie was deposited outside and the door flung shut.\n\n\"Master!\" Marie exclaimed.\n\n\"Master let me in!\" she demanded as she pummelled the door. \"What the heck?!\"\n\nMarie called out a few more times, to no avail, before giving up and leaving in a huff.\n\n\"What was that all about?\" She assumed, quite appropriately, that her 'Master' would guide her with her cultivation and help her decipher the complex insights that followed, much like how Teacher Larks did with Markus. Yet the reality was far from her expectations. She sighed out loud and wallowed over the unfairness in the way the two Masters treated their Disciples.\n\n\"Should I just renounce my discipleship?\" The thought flashed across Marie's mind for a split second. Seeing as how her Master wasn't so inclined to teach her, what point was there in her remaining under him? However, she couldn't firm her resolve on that matter.\n\n\"I don't have a choice here, do I?\" Marie didn't believe this because of all that 'fate' mumbo-jumbo. No. She believed that she didn't have another choice because following her current path of The Heavenly Eye appeared to be the most direct one towards her goals. Maybe another option existed out there, but Marie wasn't confident that it would be so easily achieved as this one.\n\n\"So what do I do?\" She quickly exited her state of dismay and focused on how to approach her current task. While she held little trust in her Master's capacity to teach, she trusted the man's firmness in passing forward the cultivation art. After all, according to him, his life was also contingent on her picking it up!\n\n\"I should break down the instructions into smaller modules.\" Marie resorted to the standard techniques taught by Teacher Larks when it came to tackling any difficult problem into smaller, bite-size chunks and addressing them individually.\n\n\"Observing the waves of fate around me...\" Marie muttered lightly. What were these so-called 'waves of fate'? Were they similar to regular waves of energy that prevailed naturally such as electromagnetic waves, sound waves, and so on? \"What does it mean to 'observe' them?\"\n\nMarie pondered whether the verb 'observe' here meant to do so using her traditional vision, or did it allude to her other human senses. \"Maybe it might even correspond to mana sense?\" In fact, she remembered that her Master also used the phrase \"become conscious of-\" which implied something more than the standard observation.\n\nNonetheless, this little brainstorming session did little to reduce the scope of the problem, rather it exacerbated it further. Shaking her head, Marie decided to move to the next chunk. \"What does it mean to 'tether tokens'?\"\n\nThis phrase proposed two keywords: 'tether' and 'tokens'. The latter most probably referred to some sort of a tool, utensil, or resource that could be manipulated as a means to divine the future. For instance, her Master tended to revert to using those cowrie shells. She also saw a bundle of sticks, dice, and many such trinkets within her Master's satchel that supported this theory.\n\nThe word 'tether' suggested that she had to, in some way, interface the 'waves of fate' mentioned earlier with these 'tokens'. How was she supposed to do that? \n\n\"On top of that, I have to 'attune' them to a question?\" How was she supposed to do that?!\n\n\"This is a wild goose chase!\" Marie exclaimed in defeat while grabbing her hair in distress.\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" But then something struck her. Seeing as how her Master felt it appropriate to introduce this new topic to her, she could safely assume that she was well-equipped for it. \"Maybe I already know everything I need to get behind this?\"\n\nIt was a valid hypothesis. Her Master couldn't expect her to be able to comprehend something by herself if he hadn't provided her with the required tools for it. Maybe pieces were missing, but they shouldn't be beyond her capacity for self-study. This line of reasoning offered some solace to Marie's agitated thoughts.\n\n\"All things considered, where do I begin?\" In all honesty, the whole endeavour felt so abstract that she feared she would never succeed, even though her Master offered his assurance. It was out of her wheelhouse; her entire life Marie only worked with absolutes, finites, and tangibles. Everything could be quantified and precisely measured and evaluated. There was no room for subjectivity, nor was there room for unsurety. Only now did she realise that the path she was walking down ran antithetically to her nature. Although on paper, The Heavenly Eye seemed to work with absolute truths and certainties, it was based on an abstract thought process that lacked proper scientific method, as Teacher Larks would put it.\n\nMarie racked her brain trying to work out an entry point. She paced mindlessly as her mind became occupied with the problem. A whole hour passed swiftly, yet Marie made no progress towards solving her current crisis. Right as she gave up, her floundering thoughts froze in place and she became aware of her surroundings.\n\n\"W-What? How did I get here?\" She exclaimed in a whispered voice. In her preoccupied stupor, Marie had effortlessly made her way out of the village, over the steps, into the orphanage, and arrived right in front of a door leading to one particular room. Although much of the orphanage had changed due to the recent renovations, the path leading to this particular room remained constant. She didn't know what drew her to this room, maybe it was a total coincidence or maybe her subconscious body had led her here at her time of struggle.\n\nIf that was true, then why was it subconscious? What urged her psyche to come here? Marie felt a conflict of emotions mentally as her mind diverted from her earlier preoccupation. 'Is it because... I feel compelled to depend on him?' She thought.\n\nMarie bit her lips as she hesitated. She wanted to take action, but at the same time, she was consciously holder herself back. It was the classic conflict between the id and ego.\n\nWhile Marie was teetering on the boundary between two decisions, a voice called out to her from the other side of the door.\n\n\"You're making me feel all anxious standing outside like that. If there's a problem, just come in! The door's open,\" Teacher Larks said encouragingly.\n\nThe call was enough to push Marie over the edge. As the firm yet soothing voice washed over her, the stuffy feeling inside her dissipated, and the stress circling her mind fizzled out. With a hopeful smile, Marie pushed open the door and walked in.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-136]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":83,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 134 - The Heavenly Eye 101","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n\"Now that we have covered most of the required basics, leaving the rest for you to pick up from Guy, it is time that we look towards beginning your cultivation journey with The Heavenly Eye,\" Krish started.\n\nMarie nodded earnestly and scooted closer to Krish who was sitting cross-legged on his bed. In the past two months, after she entered Krish's discipleship, Marie was guided through a series of techniques ranging from breathing exercises, movement exercises, mana control exercises, mana sensing exercises- basically all the core techniques a mage is taught, short of meditation exercises because, according to her Master, \"The Yoga your Teacher Larks is preaching is infinitely better than any meditation exercise I have come across.\" That confession did bring about a smile to Marie's face, in that she felt proud for some reason. Marie didn't know this yet, but she felt the same when a child felt when someone praised their parent.\n\nAnyways, after slogging through the basics, she had finally reached the point where she could take the first steps towards becoming a proper cultivator of The Heavenly Eye.\n\n\"A word of caution before we continue: Unlike most other cultivation paths in this world, The Heavenly Eye is the most dangerous, because it tampers with one of the most fundamental concepts of the world. Fate.\"\n\nKrish paused to let the statement settle before continuing, \"Well, fate as a concept is most important to sentient beings like us who worry about things beyond just survival. With any other mundane animal, understanding fate is irrelevant for they only care about where their next meal will come from and where they can safely lay their heads and sleep. However, humans and other advanced species care about more than just eating, sleeping- living in general. We care about how certain decisions will affect us down the line. We care about what will happen to us if we go down our current trajectory. We care about how we affect others around us. For humans, life is never a static bubble, it keeps expanding and encompassing everything that falls within our perception both spatially and temporally.\"\n\n\"To that point: a mage can grow to become prescient about what is around them at a given point in time, thanks to their mana sense. And, to a degree, they can also become prescient about what will become in the immediate future given current trends. But that is where the certainty ends - what lies beyond that temporal horizon is as murky as milk. Except when observed through The Heavenly Eye. The Heavenly Eye sees all and knows all things prescribed in one's fate.\"\n\nAt this point, Marie raised her hands earnestly.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"When you said that 'The Heavenly Eye sees all and knows all', how do you observe everything that CAN and WILL happen. As in, how do you process all that information.\"\n\n\"That's the fascinating, or from another perspective morbid, aspect of fate. Fate is an uninterruptable and immutable sequence. What is set to happen, will happen, lest someone outside of fate's machinations interferes. No one is unbound from the shackles of fate. While other cultivation paths that deal with divination tinker with this sequence, they can only gain a glimpse of where this sequence will lead. However, The Heavenly Eye exists outside this sequence and can thus gaze at the sequence in its entirety!\"\n\n\"That means you are unbound from the shackle of fate,\" Marie said in a tone that implied she was correcting something.\n\n\"Right... What's your point?\"\n\n\"You said 'No one' is unbound from fate, but clearly you are. Your statement was incorrect,\" she clarified.\n\n\"It's a figure of speech,\" Krish sighed. \"Don't read into things so deeply, okay?\"\n\n\"Well, you ARE the teacher. You should teach better...\" Marie muttered under her breath.\n\nKrish coughed audibly to mask his Disciple's sheepish comments and carried on. \"As you so RIGHTLY corrected, those practising The Heavenly Eye are unbound from fate. We can choose to live outside of it. But this freedom comes at great cost.\"\n\nHe pulled up his loose trousers to reveal his emaciated leg, \"To tamper with fate's immutable sequence requires a sacrifice. That is only fair, after all. The universe is anything but unjust when it comes to this. When you mess with fate to save something you love, something else that you hold equally dearly will be taken away from you.\"\n\nMarie understood Krish's hints and a sense of foreboding dawned upon her. She realised that the path she was about to step on was more precarious than she had expected it to be.\n\n\"C-Can't you heal your leg? You're a mage, after all, there have to be potions or healing arts to fix this, right?\"\n\n\"Naive child! Do you think that I haven't tried? The universe does not compromise. Each debt will be collected in a timely fashion. And this is the main point I want to drill into you today. After stepping down this path, there will be no turning back. There WAS no turning back from the very beginning. The world chose you, how else do you think I can teach you the intricacies of this cultivation method. Anyone without an affinity to The Heavenly Eye will have to face the weight of the entire universe, should they learn and/or teach the method to those not attuned to it. On a side note, it would be impossible to teach others anyway since there are barriers to learning that a regular mage cannot overcome. HOWEVER, should you forcefully puncture that barrier and inculcate the cultivation to them through |Soul Imprint| or something similar, be prepared to face the entire weight of the universe!\"\n\nKrish leaned forward and highlighted with a forceful and firm tone, \"A mage practising The Heavenly Eye has everything to lose. After looking into fate's sequence with The Eye, if you take any steps to alter it, you will suffer. I will say it now, and I will say it again in the future, knowing too much is a curse in and of itself. I firmly advise you to never, EVER, take action upon your visions unless it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\"\n\n\"How do I know if something falls under that category?\"\n\n\"As long as I am alive, I want you to defer to me,\" Krish answered. \"I will guide you on navigating through this precarious maze. I hope that at the time of my passing, IF that time does ever come, that you remain intact and fully functional.\"\n\n\"You know, what you've revealed to me has got me thinking. If let's say, you didn't find someone to pass down your cultivation method to and you passed away. What happens then? Does The Heavenly Eye just cease to exist?\"\n\nKrish smiled appreciatively and replied, \"Your question is quite valid given that at any given time, there can only be two practitioners of The Heavenly Eye. Don't ask me why, I don't know the reason either it's just the way it has been. However, there was a period a few generations before my Master's in which there was no record of The Heavenly Eye's practitioners.\"\n\n\"What happened then? Without someone to pass on the teaching, how did the art persist?\"\n\nKrish reached towards his bedside and pulled at his satchel. He reached into it and retrieved a plethora of items from within. He placed a single, unassuming cowrie shell in front of Marie. He then followed it up with a slender palm length stick from a stack of many. Next, he placed a small marble ball, and so on and on until the table in front of Marie was filled with a myriad of unrelated trinkets.\n\n\"Here, hold this,\" Krish said as he handed the cowrie shell to Marie. With a sceptical frown, Marie grasped the item. Right as her fingers coiled around the shell, a small influx of information flooded into her brain.\n\n\"T-This!\"\n\n\"Now this,\" Krish handed the stick next. Marie hesitantly grasped this new item and immediately received the same sensation as before.\n\n\"W-What are these?\"\n\nKrish revealed a devious smug and said, \"Inheritance artefacts!\"\n\nMarie's eyes widened in shock as the pile of trash in front of her immediately morphed into a mountain of endless riches.\n\n\"Don't eye them like that!\" Krish immediately reprimanded as he noticed the growing greed in her gaze.\n\n\"These artefacts are the remnants of the ancestral practitioners of The Heavenly Eye,\" Krish clarified. \"This is how The Heavenly Eye is preserved over the generation. You might have felt a sensation when you grasped the artefacts, correct?\"\n\nWithout waiting to receive Marie's nod, Krish continued, \"For a short period, there were no practitioners of The Heavenly Eye. But, after the period ended, my Grandmaster's Grandmaster stumbled upon the artefacts left by the previous practitioners. Through it, they were able to revive the art. So, to answer your earlier question, if I had perished before finding a Disciple someone down the line would find this sack filled with all the artefacts and carry on the art.\"\n\n\"So The Heavenly Eye will always persist?\"\n\n\"It has to.\"\n\n\"I have another question, when you said that you and I are outside of fate's sequence, does it mean that we cannot predict our own futures?\"\n\n\"That is partly true. Due to the uncertain nature of our existence, we cannot predict our own fate beyond a certain point. The immediate future and a bit beyond is visible, but no more. There is a way to overcome this, and that is by firmly adhering to fate's preset sequence - by not relying on The Heavenly Eye too much.\"\n\nMarie nodded in contemplation for a while as she digested all the information her Master had dumped on her. To an extent, she had an idea of the crux of the cultivation method through her own investigation, but it helped solidify a few of her assumptions and iron out some of her misconceptions after hearing it directly from her Master.\n\n\"With all this said, we cannot deny that The Heavenly Eye is in its heart a cultivation method based on divination. There are uncountable divination based cultivation arts, sects, and schools in this world. Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses, but The Heavenly Eye reigns supreme in its efficacy!\" Krish declared with a shameless grin. \"And that is where our journey will begin: Divination.\"\n\nMarie pulled herself into a tight cross-legged posture and straightened her back, in preparation for Krish's lecture. \"Divination can be classified based on the time frame and context over which they are applied. To run we must first learn to crawl, hence what we will cover first is short-term or contextually immediate divination. To achieve this using The Heavenly Eye, we need to first become perceptive of the waves of fate around us.\"\n\n\"Waves?\"\n\n\"Just like the wind that blows imperceptibly, the waves of fate constantly flow through us, around us, and against us. Before awakening The Heavenly Eye, we need to become conscious about how these minute waves vary, ebb and flow. We need to then tether tokens to these waves and tune them to the information being divined, and observe how these tokens are affected to derive the answer.\"\n\nMarie looked at Krish with an incredulous gaze. She coughed before asking, \"Can you show me an example?\"\n\nKrish nodded before bringing out the rest of his cowrie shells. \"Ask!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-135]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":84,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 133 - (Interlude) Overcoming Roadblocks","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nWhen someone skirts through life without a single speedbump, it is often the case that they assume they will never hit one in the future. Most individuals experiencing such an unhindered life tend to grow arrogant and proud. Those born with such a gift by circumstance tend to wear this pride and arrogance externally, others awarded such a gift through chance or luck hide it deep within while covering it up with a facade of nonchalance and humility. However, one fact remains constant amongst these two breeds of individuals, when one day they collide against an immovable wall of impediment, the hubris coursing through their veins bursts magnificently, cracking through the veneer wrapping their fragile ego.\n\n\"Damn it! F**k!\" Myron screamed out loud in exasperation.\n\n\"Just who is that kid?\" That detail still bugged Myron to no end. The boy named Kano had essentially popped up out of nowhere. No matter how hard Myron tried to dig into the boy's identity, he kept running into dead ends.\n\n\"F**K!\"\n\nJust when he thought he got one over Goran, a little anomaly he never accounted for slid in and spoiled EVERYTHING!\n\n\"Just where did he come from?\" Myron collapsed into a defeated squat and scratched his head in annoyance.\n\nMyron was born with everything anyone could ever ask for. Money? He had loads of it! Power? He was a scion of the Rasmus Clan, the only group with more power than them in the Empire were the Dukes' and the Emperor's clan itself. Love? He didn't care for that... but he had that in spades as well!\n\nYet, even with all of this, he kept losing against Goran!\n\nMyron's ego bubble had burst years back after his public loss against Goran in the contest to decide the next clan patriarch. Coincidentally, it also happened to be the time when he felt he was at his peak. He was strong, he had all the backing of the clan, he had it all! And then... he lost everything, in one fell swoop. Myron couldn't accept that. He couldn't, because his heart didn't want to recognise that he - the man who had everything - lost to Goran - who had nothing! Because Myron knew, deep down in his heart, that if he recognised his loss, it meant that he was worthless and that everything he grew up believing was all a lie. Of course, Myron wasn't conscious enough to make those logical connections. He was moving based purely on the human instinct to absolve all blame off oneself and offload it onto others. That is, create a straw man that embodies all of your insecurities and weaknesses, and attack it until satisfied.\n\nMyron curled his hands into a shaking fist, raised it towards the skies and declared that he would get back at Goran for this slight. The passerby simply ignored him as the rambling of a mentally unwell individual.\n\nHowever, he wasn't the only one going through such a breakdown. On the other side, in the alley neighbouring the Artist's Guild, Jo Way was going through a similar process.\n\n\"F**K! Who does that old man think he is?!\" He spat out a mouthful of clotted blood as his body expunged the remnants from his still-healing internal injuries. \"I won that duel! How dare he treat me like this?\"\n\nReferring to the two types of individuals from before, Jo Way was evidently the latter kind. He was foisted with a powerful ability following his transmigration, one which he had taken for granted. It had awarded him a subjectively worry-free lifestyle. He hadn't done much in his previous life to deserve this, that was a fact, although Jo would argue otherwise. He may claim that he had to drag himself through mind-numbing, arduous work every day in his past life. He may claim that his chance at a second life and the game-breaking special ability that came with it was well-deserved after suffering through an \"unfair\" life.\n\nBut Jo knew, deep down, that he was standing on thin ice. He was thrown into a world completely unlike his own and was forced to live amongst people wielding unimaginable power that could crush him in a heartbeat. Yet he had confidence through some feeble reasoning that his \"system\" would carry him to new heights. And after a few minor victories with the help of the system, his earlier assumption was simply augmented.\n\n'I am invincible! With this system, I can become the strongest being in this world!' Although Jo didn't say this out loud and didn't think it explicitly, his subconscious mind had borne this mentality.\n\nJo became callous. Where he expected life to be a smooth ride, an unexpected pebble had materialised and caused his entire vehicle to overturn. It was downright embarrassing. He should have just kept quiet, but when he saw the crowd wavering back then, something inside him cracked.\n\nThrough experience, Jo had somehow realised that things transpired in a certain order. He would get challenged, and he would overcome the challenge. It could be thought of as going over a hill, the difficult part came first in going uphill, but once the peak was scaled going downhill was merely an afterthought. That's how it had always been.\n\nYet this time, it plateaued.\n\nThe sudden detour caught Jo by surprise. Humans are anything but creatures of habit, and if something deviates from their expectations then by default they enter fight or flight mode. Jo wasn't intimidated by the little kid \"challenging\" his success, so there was no need for flight. He went up in arms to rebut the kid's declaration by instinct, but he never expected that the mere boy had an insane backer. Jo wasn't idiotic enough to go up against someone two levels above him, yet his oversight led him to bang his head against a wall.\n\n'W-wait a minute...' Jo suddenly realised that the events that transpired earlier had a similar cadence to a few events he'd witnessed earlier in this life.\n\n'D-did I just become... the \"Young Master\"?!' Jo's entire worldview shattered. He quickly shook his head to deny that blasphemous statement.\n\n\"Right! It was all that Keegan Lang's fault! And that kid! Stupid system!\" Jo had found his straw man- men! He silently swore that he would retaliate this wrong a hundredfold!\n\n{*Tsk* Is this all you can do? Huh? Whine, whine, whine all day?}\n\n'Huh? System, you're here?!'\n\nSilence.\n\n'System!'\n\n\"System!\"\n\nNo dice!\n\nAmidst his rage-filled curses towards the system, Jo suddenly recollected a key piece of information from before.\n\n\"Guy Larks!\" Jo remembered hearing that name somewhere earlier. After clearing his mind of all disruptions, he managed to unearth it from its deepest recesses. \"Right! It's that Guy!\"\n\nThe man who happened to be this body's friend when he transmigrated. He was also the very same Teaching Apprentice he was placed against in the first match at the tournament. In fact, Jo nearly lost to Guy that time if not for his Disciple's timely breakthrough with perfected resonance.\n\n\"It's him again...\"\n\nJo had an inkling early on that maybe he wasn't the only one who had transmigrated into this world. This was supported by the fact that there was a glaringly empty entry in the library under Markus' name.\n\n'Unknown.' For a system that labelled itself as omniscient, this word meant that either it was lying, or that the target was not from this world. The system had yet to fail him, so he was inclined to trust it even though the circumstances behind him receiving it was still a bit sketchy. Thus, by deduction, there was an anomaly.\n\nMarkus wasn't a transmigrant, that fact Jo had already confirmed way back. After hitting a dead end there, Jo dropped his investigation because he felt like it wouldn't lead anywhere.\n\nBut now, upon hearing the name Guy Larks again, Jo's interest was reignited. He had to know if Guy Larks was also like him!\n\nHe just HAD to!\n\n____\n\n\"What do you see?\"\n\n\"I don't know. A red dragon?\"\n\n\"No, you idiot! Remember what Artist Reva said, look deeper.\"\n\n\"I... really don't know... why don't you help me out?\"\n\n\"Hehe, I don't know either...\"\n\n\"Isn't it interesting that the boy was able to recreate an extremely lifelike facade of a red dragon, given that he hasn't witnessed one in real life?\" An authoritative voice interrupted the two bickering observers.\n\n\"A-Artist Lang!\"\n\n\"Look at these confident strokes, the artist had no uncertainty about the appearance of the beast at all as though they'd observed it personally, downright felt its scales even. And the bold usage of colours and shades, although they're of poor quality, they are faithful,\" Keegan continued.\n\n\"A-Artist Lang?\" One of the artists spoke meekly. \"Have you seen a red dragon before?\"\n\nKeegan smirked proudly and answered, \"I have! And it looked exactly like the one right in front of you. Well, that's an exaggeration. It appeared similar, but the feeling- the aura it exuded was exactly the same. Right now, as I am looking at this painting, I can actually feel myself staring down the eyes of a red dragon.\"\n\n\"But that would mean...\"\n\n\"Yes, this painting has reached level three. In fact, it is close to breaking into level four territory! It's crude and lacks finishing, but it's there alright! And as you know, to reach level three, it is not just necessary to paint a subject, one must also capture the immaterial tethered to it. To do this, one needs to be intimate with the subject they're painting.\"\n\n\"Can't he have just copied another's work?\" The other artist blurted out, receiving a pointed glare from the first artist.\n\n\"You two should be knowledgeable enough to know the answer to that stupid question,\" Keegan snorted disdainfully.\n\n\"Given that the artist didn't copy someone else's work, AND that he hasn't witnessed a red dragon in real life. I can only assume that he was exposed to it through books and literature. Furthermore, the artist revealed that he has difficulty reading, yet he managed to create a realistic replica of a red dragon through his painting which indicates that he has an overpowering imagination and a high level of empathy. If I was to extend it further, the boy's mind can see without his eyes having seen them! Isn't that just great?\"\n\nKeegan observed the two artists enter a trance as they digested everything he'd just said. He revealed a faint smile before turning to leave. This was his third viewing of Kano's painting, and with each viewing, he was surprised to learn something new in the work. Although the painting was immature in its conception, there was great potential hidden in it just waiting to be unearthed.\n\nKeegan smiled as he exited the exhibition hall. Along the way, he walked past the Guild Manager's office to pick up his cautiously wrapped painting. It wasn't that no one offered to purchase his work, but rather he felt that making a sale was unnecessary. After moving past his subconscious mental block, a huge burden was unloaded from him. With it, Keegan lost the wheedling sensation that urged him to earn more money.\n\n\"I guess I have enough now, right?\" He inquired mirthfully as he left the guild building, a satisfied expression blooming on his face for the first time in his life.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-134]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":85,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 132 - Unexpected Breakthrough","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nKano pulled out his tongue and bit it lightly while showing an apologetic frown.\n\n\"Actually, after thinking about it, I don't think I should present my analysis of Artist Lang's work just yet,\" Kano admitted.\n\n\"Why? You don't have to worry, I won't get offended.\"\n\n\"That's not it. With the other artists here, I had sufficient information about their pasts and history to extrapolate an analysis from their works. But with Artist Lang, I don't have any background research to work with. Anything I say will only be a theory,\" Kano explained.\n\n\"That works too. If you want to know anything, just ask me,\" Keegan offered with a sincere nod.\n\n\"Based on the work on display here, and those of Artist Lang's that are owned by the Rasmus Clan, I've noticed a common trend where fewer qualitative tonal variations of colours are used in the paintings. For example, w-w-when Artist Lang painted the vibrant grass field, rather than utilising the common two-tone combination of verdant and viridian green, Artist Lang opted for a flatter, natural green shade, and using layering and dilution with water or oil to obtain the darker and brighter tonal variations. A-A-Actually, it is the case for any instance where a wide wash of colour is required, such as the skies, deserts, oceans, or any sprawling natural landforms.\"\n\nKeegan pondered on the observation and affirmed with a surprised exclamation, \"Do I? I... never noticed that.\"\n\n\"You do. From Artist Lang's earliest works, this d-d-detail remains consistent. I don't exactly know the reason why Artist Lang might revert to this, but I have a hypothesis,\" Kano indicated while showing a conflicted expression. \"But I would like to hear Artist Lang's thoughts first.\"\n\nKeegan scratched his head in confusion and answered while shaking his head, \"To be honest, I didn't realise that I had such a quirk. To me, it all just felt right that way.\" He then turned to the audience and asked, \"Didn't you guys notice this?\"\n\nThe crowd shrunk back immediately. No one in their right minds would think of offending a 6-star artist by blabbing pointlessly. However, from the front, Artist Norris chimed in with an audible voice, \"I don't think we contemplated over it either. To us, it looked perfect. The colours just worked. And given how Artist Lang's works successfully achieve the fifth level, we assumed that the quality spoke for itself.\"\n\n\"What's your theory then?\" Keegan asked Kano.\n\n\"I thought about it for a while, and realised that back when I first started painting, a-a-and had a shortage of qualitative colour tones at hand, I used to do the same thing. I would layer and/or dilute my available natural paint shades to achieve varying tones exactly how Artist Lang does it. This got me thinking, does Artist Lang not have access to a lot of paint either?\" Kano asked with an innocent inflexion in his voice.\n\nThe audience broke into uproarious laughter upon hearing this.\n\n\"The boy sure knows how to joke! Artist Lang is loaded! How would he have a shortage of colours?\"\n\n\"Don't tease him, the boy did say that it was just a hypothesis...\"\n\n\"Let's be real now. Hypotheses need to have some factual foundations.\"\n\nAs the crowd descended into condescending conversations, Keegan entered deep rumination. Achieving a 6-star license was no easy feat. This was especially true for practitioners in crafting type fields because it was at this stage that the practitioner was deemed an expert capable of consistently outputting the best that could be achieved in said field. For Enchanters, it refers to Legendary grade weapons and armours, for Alchemists it refers to the most potent of potions capable of swaying people with a mere whiff, and for Artists, it corresponds to level five paintings.\n\nKeegan's position as a 6-star artist indicated that he could continuously produce level five paintings, with a success rate of 80% given his most recent statistic. To achieve this, he had to go through gruelling periods of constantly creating works, undergoing brutal critiquing and defence sessions, implementing changes to improve his techniques, rinse and repeat. It reached a point where Keegan himself wondered why he had first set out on this path; was he a low-key masochist who gained pleasure from beating himself emotionally? Unlikely. In fact, Keegan knew deep down exactly why he was suffering through it all.\n\nMoney...\n\nThe root of all evil, or the solution to all problems, depends on who you asked. For Keegan, it was undoubtedly the latter. Being borne of an ignoble household, Keegan, like many others, was constantly wanting for money. To pay the mounting debts accrued by his gambling-addicted father, to pay for the treatment of his mother who used to suffer from a debilitating illness - before her death - and at least enough to fill his stomach every day. Needless to say, Keegan's childhood was anything but pleasant. It was through sheer luck that he managed to crawl out of that bottomless pit.\n\nKeegan had a talent for art. He knew it from a young age. One of the many part-time jobs he assumed would be to paint advertising boards for low-level plays and dramas, as well as for small businesses. He would receive the most commissions as well as the highest praises from his customers and the audience. It was through one of his works that he met his teacher. The old man stumbled upon one of his advertisements as he was travelling through Keegan's town, and discovered his budding talents. After a short introduction and offer, Keegan accepted the man and left his town without a second thought.\n\nWhat Keegan had joined was a generic school for artists, much like the Academies of magic. Unlike those Academies, the school followed a similar hierarchical structure to that of Sects. What Keegan had become upon joining the school was an affiliated student, which was below a regular, paying student; he was only a student by name, which was more than enough for him seeing as he didn't have to pay for attending classes. Instead, he was responsible for cleaning the classrooms and facilities, maintaining the gardens, running errands for the paying students and teachers, and other menial tasks. He was basically a glorified servant who worked without wages... a slave. But that was fine too! Keegan could sit in classes, albeit a few metres outside the door, and he could meet and exchange ideas with a few teachers, in their bedrooms... at night.\n\nNonetheless, Keegan never faltered. He realised very quickly that the life of an artist was a lucrative one. Besides he had no other choice. He didn't have any other skills or special abilities. And with a firm resolve to escape the mire that was his current life, Keegan burst through the ranks and quickly stood out among the other affiliated students, who were very few and far in between. At the end of every year, the affiliated students would undergo an assessment of sorts to gauge their advancement. Those that displayed acceptable results became regular students, with a conditional offer, while those that didn't were kicked out. It wasn't shocking that most, if not all, affiliated students would fail these assessments because they rarely got any time for themselves to sit in and learn. Yet Keegan was the first to pass! The other affiliated students didn't have any qualms about this either because they had personally seen how much he had put up with to achieve this.\n\nUpon becoming a regular student, he gained access to the Common cultivation method the other artists practised and gradually started rising through the ranks. One must know that most such specialised schools had only a few cultivation methods in their possession, unlike Academies. These specialised cultivation methods were generally geared towards their own craft or profession and weren't suitable for combat. Keegan luckily found himself resonating with this cultivation method and swiftly advanced through realms, even faster than the other regular students.\n\nHis progress shocked the faculty in the school, one of whom - the man who had brought him in - immediately took Keegan under him as a sponsored student. This transition brought with it certain benefits, such as the Advanced grade version of his current cultivation method, and additional resources and support structures.\n\nSixty years after joining the school, Keegan advanced to the Core Condensation realm, and five years after that he earned his 6-star license. Along the way, he made a name for himself, earned a fortune, and forced himself to forget his modest origins. In fact, Keegan would often overcompensate, indulging in excessive spending to prove to himself that he was rich now. He lived in a house large enough to support three families. In it, he only used one bedroom, bathroom and living room. The rest of the rooms were perpetually locked and unused. Keegan would indulge in different cuisines, most of which he never even touched, just admired to boast his fortune.\n\nPart of the reason why he lived this way was to convince himself that he was now in a good financial position. The other was to prove to himself that the money he'd earned wouldn't one day just disappear into a whiff of smoke, like a vicious nightmare.\n\nYet as the saying went, it was possible to take a man out of poverty but it was impossible to take poverty out of the man. Even with so much money, resources, and backers at his disposal, Keegan had subconsciously reverted to one of his earliest habits from childhood. One of the reasons why most businessmen commissioned Keegan for his painted advertisements was because of the severely low pricing point he had set for himself. He did it primarily to stand out amongst the competition and convince them to invest in a child as opposed to his competing professionals. Yet this didn't mean that he was running at a loss, he made just as much profit per commission as the other artists. This was because Keegan had figured out how to be economical with his paint usage. He would opt for natural paint, from powdered wild-flower petals and leaves mixed with oil and water. Although the life of these paintings with organically made colours was short, it was enough for the needs of advertising as it wasn't meant to be put up for a long time.\n\nThat habit of his - the preference of duller natural tones - had seemingly become ingrained into his bones that, even after reaching such heights, Keegan still preferred them over others. Although the paint he used was superior, more professional, its shades intimately matched those of the ones he had used in his childhood.\n\n'The me that I've been trying to suppress my whole life never left. It was right beside me all along, holding my hand as I painted.\" A lone tear dripped out of Keegan's eye as a plethora of repressed memories flooded into his brain. He suddenly recollected the times from his childhood when he received commissions and earned menial copper for his works. They weren't much, but his works from back then brought him the most satisfaction. Even more than what he felt nowadays from making level five paintings.\n\nThe realisation struck him like a hammer and brought with it a boost of inspiration that shook his soul. The mana in the atmosphere turned turbulent as it started to form a massive whirlwind, with the eye centred on Keegan. The disturbance caught the attention of those around him, snapping them out of their trivial discussions.\n\n\"Artist Lang! He's breaking through in his cultivation!\" One of them exclaimed.\n\n\"Are you stupid? That's not a breakthrough in his cultivation, that's advancement through |Introspection|. His spirituality achieved a breakthrough,\" Another one rebutted.\n\nThe incredible phenomenon lasted for exactly five minutes, within that time, Keegan indulged in the outburst of emotions that usually followed a spiritual breakthrough, and worked towards consolidating his cultivation. After taking a few more minutes to centre himself, Keegan opened his eyes and revealed a bright smile - one that originated from the deepest confines of his heart - towards Kano. He then walked up to the boy and patted his head lovingly.\n\n\"Thank you, Kano. Thank you,\" he said in a soft yet audible tone.\n\nKano smiled back and exclaimed with childish excitement, \"Artist Lang called me by my name!\"\n\n\"I did! You can call me Keegan,\" he offered back.\n\n\"B-B-But you are my elder, and my senior,\" Kano blurted out in shock.\n\nKeegan shook his head and said, \"I think we are more than that now. We're friends, right?!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-133]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":86,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 131 - Kano's Breakdown","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"The hell did he just say? Artist's signature?\"\n\n\"He can't be talking about the seal every artist places at the corner of their works, right?\"\n\nThe incredulous talks prevailing in the audience caused Kano to blush in embarrassment.\n\n\"By the artist's signature, I meant the unique imprint every artist leaves in their work that speaks to its context. As in, the artist's personal touch that brings their own soul, for the lack of a better word, into their work,\" Kano elaborated with some difficulty.\n\nThe audience nodded absent-mindedly, yet it was evident that they didn't understand what the boy was trying to say. They were just too shy and embarrassed to admit it out loud. Although Keegan was of the same mindset, he was far too intrigued by the boy's line of reasoning. He decided to drop his arrogant demeanour and asked, \"I don't quite understand.\"\n\nKano scratched his chin in thought as his eyes darted around the area. He figured that in order to illustrate his point, it would be more efficient to use an example or test case. He had learned from watching Teacher Larks that sometimes an apt example could do wonders towards assuring assimilation of knowledge. As an idea started to form in his mind, Kano approached Artist Norris who was fidgeting in place behind his table.\n\n\"Artist Norris, your entry for this duel was a painting of a building,\" Kano started. \"I've noticed that you never attempt anything other than buildings, structures, or architecture. I recollect observing a single landscape from your earlier works, but you never made another one after that.\"\n\nArtist Norris nodded in affirmation, and the crowd added a few agreeing hums as well. \"That's not a secret. Artist Norris is famous for his recreation of architecture, cityscapes and so on.\"\n\n\"Well... Why is it that you don't draw or paint landscapes, portraits, or any other such genres?\" Kano inquired.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Artist Norris blurted out subconsciously. \"They're just too... irregular I guess.\"\n\nKano nodded lightly before raising his hands and turning one of the hanging brushes on the table by a small angle. Immediately after he left the brush, Artist Norris leaned forward and returned the brush to its initial orientation. This time, Kano moved and nudged the table forward from one side. Artist Norris clicked his tongue and quickly shifted the table to return it into its original position. Kano tilted the inkstone by a small margin, and while Artist Norris was busy fixing that discrepancy, Kano went up to the hanging paintings and tilted Artist Norris' by a bit.\n\n\"Boy, what are you doing?\" Artist Norris exclaimed as he briskly walked forward and adjusted the askew sheet.\n\n\"Why do you do this?\" Kano inquired.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nKano repeated his earlier action and started to tilt the painting, but his hand was captured by Artist Norris who scowled back in irritation.\n\n\"This,\" Kano indicated by nudging his head towards his imprisoned hand. \"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"I-\" Artist Norris stopped midway. He never thought about why he did these things, he just did them because they felt right. \"What are you implying, boy?\"\n\n\"I can't say for sure, because I am not exactly qualified, but I think you have obsessive-compulsive disorder,\" Kano hypothesised.\n\n\"What disorder?! How dare you?!\" Artist Norris exclaimed out loud. Although he hadn't heard of that ailment before, knowing that it was some form of disorder generally enraged him. He turned his head around to see the audience's reaction, only to find out that everyone was equally puzzled. No one had ever heard of it before. Well, no one except for Jo Way, whose eyes widened slightly in shock. He quickly controlled his agitation, lest his internal injury gets exacerbated.\n\n'How does the boy know? Is- Is he also a transmigrated soul?' Jo Way quickly inquired his \"system\", only to receive silence as usual. Unfortunately, the boy wasn't displaying martial techniques or spells, otherwise, Jo Way could have consulted the book generated in his mind about the boy. He immediately trained his complete attention on the boy.\n\nThe reason Kano knew about OCD was that he had heard about it from Teacher Larks. After learning that he had dyslexia, Kano was encouraged to talk with Teacher Larks and learn more about what it meant. Through it, Kano was introduced to a myriad of other, similar, conditions that people suffered from. One of them that stood out to Kano was OCD, this was because he didn't understand why such a condition was labelled as a mental disorder along the same line as his dyslexia. Based on how it was described, Kano felt that it was pretty harmless, maybe even a boon. The compulsiveness to achieve just the right result or being extremely thorough didn't sound malicious to him. Yet after facing someone with the disorder and observing just how distressed they felt with the slightest deviation in their surroundings, Kano finally understood why.\n\nKano expounded with a measured tone, \"D-D-Do you often feel an urgency to repeat an action because something just didn't feel right? D-D-Do you find yourself repeatedly cleaning your hands or clothes at the slightest invasion of your private space?\"\n\nArtist Norris frowned as he nodded in affirmation to both the questions.\n\n\"I've only observed a limited amount of Artist Norris' public works, yet from the ones I have seen, I've noticed that the structures you choose to paint are often symmetric or methodically built with quasi-symmetry in prominent sections,\" Kano continued. \"This, as well as your behaviour before led me to believe that you have obsessive-compulsive disorder.\"\n\nBefore Artist Norris could howl and deny everything vehemently Kano offered some reassuring words filled with sincerity, \"Please don't be offended, Artist Norris. I am not disparaging you, in fact, I r-r-respect that you've achieved such heights in spite of your affliction. I for one look up to you for it! I a-a-actually suffer from a similar disorder that makes it difficult for me to read.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! I've seen you devouring the guidebook just a few hours ago,\" Keegan interrupted.\n\n\"It's thanks to my Teacher Larks. I wouldn't have been able to reach such a level if not for his guidance,\" Kano quickly clarified.\n\n'Teacher Larks!' Jo Way snapped. 'I've heard that name before... Where was it?!' As he wracked his brains to unearth the faintly familiar name, Kano resumed his earlier train of thought.\n\n\"What I r-r-realised after examining the paintings on display, and after understanding more about the artists that have made them, is that art and the artist are a joint package.\"\n\n\"That isn't news,\" someone from the crowd commented.\n\n\"The art r-r-reflects the artist. It portrays their true self, and what lies within their hearts,\" Kano continued. \"Artist Norris' works are famous for their impeccable similitude. An artist needs to deeply envision their subject while painting it to successfully achieve level three. How can Artist Norris attempt any other genre of paintings if he himself feels anxious or uncomfortable to visualise something like nature that bears stark irregularities, flaws or variations?\"\n\nThat statement evoked a symphony of awes from the audience who finally understood the crux of Kano's thesis.\n\n\"Artist Lysa's paintings all share one similarity, in that they all contain a dog or are derivative of canine spirit in some way,\" Kano said as he turned to a woman in the crowd. \"I read in Artist Lysa's biography that you had contracted a Lion-Hound familiar for the majority of your early days as a mage, which passed away due to an unfortunate incident. Does Artist Lysa feel compelled to include her beloved companion in her works because she misses it dearly?\"\n\nThe woman nodded lightly after pondering over the question.\n\n\"Artist Nana's paintings lean towards a darker colour palette, and the themes within the paintings lean heavily towards m-m-morose and ominous topics such as in 'The Dilapidated Gallows' or 'Plagued Land',\" Kano said to another person in the crowd who looked scrawny, with a depressed aura radiating from him. \"I've learned that Artist Nana lost his family at a young age to the P-P-Plague of Dark Cleansing. Does that unfortunate tragedy affect your thoughts when you sit down to paint?\"\n\n\"It never leaves...\" the man admitted with a dismayed expression. \"It's all I think about.\"\n\nKano continued to list out his observations of the works of artists present in the crowd. One after another, he presented his findings as well as his explanation for the conclusion. Each artist was deeply moved by the incisive detail with which Kano broke down their deepest secrets which were often unknown to themselves. It offered a profound look within themselves and about how they approached their own crafts.\n\n\"As I've explained, an artist's work is a reflection of their inner self. In Artist Norris' painting, I can see him - I can see his signature. However, I cannot say the same for Teacher Way's faultless work. It is perfect, yet it does not show Teacher Way. Or maybe I am wrong and Teacher Way's signature is p-p-perfection. But beauty in art is in the imperfections that evoke thought from the audience. I don't feel anything compelling when I look at Teacher Way's work. I'm sorry,\" Kano added while bowing profusely in Jo Way's direction.\n\nThe concluding remarks caused the audience to reevaluate their earlier impression of the duel's outcome. While it was evident that Teacher Way's work was superior to Artist Norris, the boy's points made valid sense. The audience was thoroughly convinced thanks to Kano's earlier demonstration by including his breakdown of their work.\n\nIn fact, they had become so enamoured by the boy's fluid explanation with a vocabulary beyond his years, that they had nearly forgotten that he was just six years old at the cusp of breaking into his seventh year. Even Keegan had overlooked this detail, which suddenly dawned on him only because the boy's hardened expression regressed into sheepish embarrassment. He chuckled internally with amusement when he realised just how seriously everyone was taking the kid's words, which was a sign that they subconsciously respected the boy. This was an admirable feat - to earn these experts' respect - especially given that he was of such a young age.\n\nHowever, Keegan wasn't totally satisfied. He was knowledgeable enough to realise that the boy's earlier thesis was a compilation of his insights specifically geared towards his artistic philosophy. To that end, the boy had covered almost all the artists whose works were on display. Almost all the artists, except for one...\n\nKeegan coughed audibly, drawing everyone's attention.\n\n\"What about me?\" He shot out.\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"You've talked about your impression of everyone else and their works. But you haven't talked about mine,\" Keegan urged with an excited look.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-132]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":87,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 130 - Artist's Duel (Part Three)","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nThe first person to break the silence did so with an elongated, \"Wow!\"\n\nThis opened up the floodgates, as others joined in appreciating the two paintings displayed before them. The first thing every artist and critique in the crowd noticed was that both the paintings had achieved the third level. This was incredible because the artists did so just within an hour and only used black ink. One must remember that a third level painting qualifies as such because when it is observed, the viewer perceives the painting in actual three dimensions. That is, they would feel as though it would be possible to touch the objects within the painting if they reached forward.\n\nHowever, the reaction of the crowd was evidently more exaggerated. This was because while Artist Norris was a licensed 3-star Artist, Jo Way was not. This meant that he was capable of producing level three paintings, however, this guarantee wasn't present with Jo Way, who was unlicensed. This dichotomy already offered Jo Way a marked edge in this competition as the judges and the audience had a low expectation from him.\n\nAfter judging the paintings at a superficial level, the judges moved closer to examine them based on the technique, composition and realism.\n\nArtist Norris had painted a building, more specifically, the facade of the 'Palace of the Sun' - the abode of the monarch of the Solar Empire. It was an extremely intricate drawing which should be incredibly hard given the generally 'runny' medium. However, Artist Norris displayed excellent control of the paintbrush and an understanding of how the liquid ink behaved on paper. The palace was a sprawling structure that was almost as large as Radiant City. It was not only home to the Emperor's family and clan, it also housed most of the public employees that worked there and the many servants. One interesting detail of the palace was that it was primarily lined with beautiful, mosaic glass designs depicting various scenes from the nation's history, from its founding till the present century.\n\nDue to the expansive architecture of the palace, it would be difficult to capture its entire facade in a single sheet, hence Artist Norris focused on the signature anterior face of the building. It did not make his life any easier, though, since the anterior section was the one loaded with the most elaborate glass artworks, as they were the first to be designed after the founding of the nation. So it was laudable how well Artist Norris managed to capture the majestic and historic aura of the particular view! Through his expert use of ink with varying gradations, he managed to recreate the exact display in black-and-white, with unerring precision. One must know just how difficult it is to emulate the transparency of glass while also ensuring that the design painted on it does not appear flat or two-dimensional. Yet, Artist Norris achieved it all within the short span of an hour.\n\nOn the other side, Jo Way opted for a more aggressive approach and painted a portrait. This was an arrogant move on his part since portraits were infinitely more challenging than landscapes to achieve the third level as the painter had to keep the aura and presence of the subject in mind when painting it. The person Jo Way painted was someone he was familiar with in this world, his student Gaige Bori. Jo Way had perfectly captured Gaige's facade; to anyone familiar with the boy, they would readily recognise the person in the portrait at first glance. The use of black and white to highlight skin folds and amplify the vigorous youth in the boy's eyes brought dynamism to the image projected in two dimensions. It was this feature that differentiated portraits from images captured by recording artefacts. The latter could just as easily capture the likeness of a person, but a good portrait transcended that and brought forward the person's essence. \n\nTo top this off, Jo Way had used the Ink Puppet Painting Technique! In using this technique, the artist needs to have the final intention firmly planted in their minds throughout the painting process. Doing this with portraits without the subject present in front of them meant that they needed a true to life facsimile of their subject in their minds at all times - their temperament, character, and aura included. This automatically tipped the scales in favour of Jo Way.\n\nOne advantage of using Gaige as the subject was that his bloodline and overall aura was complemented by the black shade the ink offered. A pervasive blanket of void surrounded the portrait of Gaige. Jo Way had masterfully used the Ink Puppet Painting Technique to create seamless gradations of black to create three-dimensional layers to this blanketing darkness that could be perceived upon closer examination. The painting itself employed heavy use of black ink, relying on the whiteness from the paper to accentuate Gaige's features. It was truly a display of exemplary skill that Jo Way managed to achieve level three with this painting, where others would have very easily drowned the paper in opaque darkness beyond recognition.\n\nEach of the judges moved closer and observed the paintings with utmost precision. A duel between artists was rare, and because of that, there was no room for error in judgement. However, it was already evident that their opinions had been swayed in favour of Jo Way's painting.\n\n\"*Tsk* Artist Norris made a huge mistake with this duel.\"\n\n\"No kidding! There goes his reputation. Who knew that Radiant City held such crouching tigers and hidden dragons, huh?\"\n\nThe crowd chimed in with their opinions as the judges spoke their piece.\n\n\"Just on the basis of technique, I believe Teacher Way's painting - specifically his use of such an advanced painting technique - has exceeded expectations,\" one of the judges commended.\n\n\"I concur. Although Artist Norris has produced an excellent painting when compared to Teacher Way's, it falls a tad short,\" the second added.\n\n\"A tad?!\" The third who showed visible enmity with Artist Norris spat out. \"It doesn't even hold a candle to Teacher Way's painting!\"\n\nThe judges did not muffle their discussion, and the audience was in agreement with the judgement they were arriving towards. With each critique offered, Artist Norris' face dropped by another margin. Finally, right as it was time to announce the victor, one of the judges turned towards Keegan and gazed at him expectantly. As a sign of respect, they were hoping to receive a word from the expert among them.\n\nKeegan recognised the cue, yet he refused to offer any criticism. He had made his point clear that this was beneath him. However, a thought popped into his head. Keegan looked towards Kano, who was perched safely on Goran's shoulders and asked, \"What do you think, Kano?\"\n\n\"Huh? Me?\" Kano pointed at himself incredulously.\n\n\"Are there any other Kanos here?\" Keegan retorted in a sarcastic tone.\n\nKano bit his tongue apologetically. Goran lifted the boy and placed him on the ground, allowing him to approach the two paintings. As he did so, the still audience broke into a heated conversation.\n\n\"Who's that kid? Is he Artist Lang's student?\"\n\n\"Unlikely. Artist Lang is notoriously quick-tempered. I don't think he's the kind of person to take on a student.\"\n\n\"Then what is Artist Lang thinking?\"\n\nThere was a common saying that it was impossible to decipher the cryptic actions of experts and geniuses. The crowd was facing the very same dilemma.\n\nThe focus of the crowd, the boy named Kano, was oblivious to the inquisitive gazes of those around him. He was solely focused on the two paintings hanging in front of him. He ruminated on them for a little over 10 minutes, all the while raising the suspense of the audience and the two competitors. Jo Way was currently irritated over what was taking so long.\n\n'Who is this kid anyway?' He thought to himself.\n\nArtist Norris on the other hand was prepared to accept his fate.\n\nRight then, Kano raised his hand, pointed at Jo Way's painting and said, \"This one is definitely superior. The artist has stretched the work to its limits given the set conditions.\"\n\nThe audience released their tension with a long sigh of relief, albeit tinted with some disappointment. Needless to say, they were faintly hoping to see some conflict or drama, maybe a twist?\n\nKeegan did not miss the distressed expression plastered over Kano's face after he finished his judgement. He immediately interrupted the erupting discussion and asked, \"But?\"\n\nKano jolted his head and shrunk into his neck sheepishly, \"I-I don't think I should continue...\"\n\n\"Speak your mind, boy!\"\n\nKano looked towards Goran but was immediately blocked by Keegan, \"Don't worry about offending anyone. If anyone dares to come at you because of your words today, I shall personally take care of them. Now continue.\"\n\nKano inhaled loudly to calm himself and continued, \"This painting is superior and wins the contest-\" He then rotated and pointed at Artist Norris' work before finishing, \"-but I like this one more.\"\n\nThe audience gasped and shrieked in shock. What a plot twist!\n\nKeegan raised his eyebrows and asked, \"Why is that?\"\n\n\"This painting speaks to me- no it resonates with me,\" Kano answered.\n\n\"What is this kid talking about?\"\n\n\"Shh! Don't interrupt!\" One of the audience members reprimanded as they pulled out some snacks from inside their jacket pocket.\n\nJo Way wore a deep frown upon hearing the kid's opinion, a reaction opposite of Artist Norris' whose dead eyes gained a fresh colour of hope.\n\n\"Elaborate,\" Keegan demanded.\n\n\"Well... T-T-The painting by Teacher Way is perfect. I do not see any flaws, errors, ticks, or trademarks in the work - given my limited knowledge. In my opinion, it is an excellent work of art at its level. But b-b-because of this, the artwork is bland. It does not have any character.\"\n\nJo Way couldn't take it any more and interjected, \"Do you even hear yourself, boy? Just because it is too perfect, it is bad? You should think before talking-\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt!\" Keegan immediately reprimanded, pulsing an ounce of his Core Condensation realm pressure on the mage two realms below him. Jo Way grit his teeth and tried to resist, only to face a much larger force. He threw up a mouthful of blood as a third wave of greater pressure collapsed on him.\n\n\"Now, continue,\" Keegan said to Kano, paying no attention to the wallowing Jo Way.\n\n\"I'm sorry that I offended you, Teacher Way,\" Kano apologised profusely. The audience noticed the sincerity in his tone and lowered their disdain for what they initially thought was just another arrogant and upstart child.\n\n\"I did not mean to disparage your work. As I said, given my limited knowledge it is excellent. By definition of the contest, it should be the victor. However-\" Kano turned to Keegan and Goran and said, \"The perfect painting lacks a key ingredient that gives it a unique character.\"\n\n\"It lacks an artist's signature,\" Kano concluded.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-131]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":88,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 129 - Artist's Duel (Part Two)","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nThe rules established were simple. Since the basis of the slight Artist Norris faced was on his skill and, by extension, capacity to teach a student, the theme of the competition was covering the basics. The two were assigned an hour, within which they only had access to a sheet of paper, black ink, and brushes. They had to use these tools to produce a completed work within the time limit regardless of its content, composition, and so on. The goal was to determine who could display a greater mastery of artistic technique given hard limitations on what tools and resources they could use.\n\nJo Way didn't show any opposition to these propositions. In fact, his unusually nonchalant expression indicated that he was unwaveringly confident in his victory, which gave a few of the observers some pause, especially Artist Norris. At this point he was expecting the man to at least whine, grovel, or complain.\n\n'Not even one word?' Artist Norris had technically stacked the deck in his favour. Everyone knew that when it came to ink painting and watercolours, Artist Norris was a leading 3-star artist. He had even published a few articles on his observations and techniques that were often used in teaching novices.\n\n'No matter,' Artist Norris said to himself as he propped his workspace. The guild provided him with an inkstone block, water, a myriad of brushes, and a large blank sheet of paper. He then proceeded to position the items in a perfect position: the block was three hand-widths away from the sheet which was placed perfectly at the centre of his table, with the edges of the two being parallel to each other. He then moved the haphazardly resting brushes around on the brush holder by order of increasing diameter. He gently squeezed the slightly flayed tips with wet fingers to produce a clean, twirling point.\n\nHe then took a step back to observe his station. Dissatisfied, he moved closer and rotated the paper by 180-degrees and moved it horizontally to the right by a millimetre.\n\n\"Shall we begin?\" Jo Way asked the three judging artists.\n\n\"Artist Norris?\" One of the three asked the man with a clear tone.\n\n\"Just a second...\" Artist Norris muttered. He took a step back, frowned and repeated the action of rotating the paper. He took a step back, frowned and moved the inkstone block to the left by a finger width. He took a step back, frowned and rotated one of the brushes by a few degrees on the stand. He took a step back, tilted his head and exhaled in satisfaction. \"I'm ready!\"\n\nAfter receiving an affirmation from both sides, the judges initiated the duel with a cadenced countdown. There was no fanfare when the match started. Unlike with martial duels, there were no flashy bursts of light, emission of heat or cold, sounds of any sort, or even any drastic movements. Instead, each artist simply began their painting.\n\nArtist Norris strafed to the left such that the ink block was perfectly in front of him. He poured a dollop of water on the block and started to grind the stone with practised elegance. As the water droplet expanded under the friction from the stone, it started to turn a shade of rich black. He placed the stone horizontally above the block and poured another dollop before repeating his actions. As he did so, a small pool of liquid black formed at the centre of inkstone. Artist Norris placed the block back on top before retrieving the widest brush from the stand. He dipped the brush at an angle into the pool and rotated it back and forth, allowing it to be fully engulfed in black paint. He lifted the brush-up vertically and held it in place, allowing excess liquid to drip off. As though it were second nature to him, he moved the brush right as the last drop escaped the tip and placed it vertically above the centre of the blank sheet.\n\nWith a confident plunge, the brush landed on the sheet of paper and started to waltz with skilful familiarity. The black ink spread majestically from the tip of the brush onto the pure white landscape, and as the brush traversed through the blank plains it delivered a continuous influx of darkness, sometimes in bulk and at other times in increments. The water soaked into the paper, carrying the dark ink along with it, depositing it as it seeped farther and farther with a gradation fading into the white.\n\nArtist Norris was so absorbed in his work that he failed to notice the ruckus Jo Way was creating.\n\n\"I-Is that the Ink Puppet Painting Technique?\"\n\n\"That's impossible! The amount of precise mana control AND predesign that is necessary to use that technique... Do you think a mere Foundation Establishment mage can accomplish it?\"\n\n\"BUT LOOK AT IT! That's the very same technique!\"\n\nKano frowned lightly before asking Keegan and Goran simultaneously, \"What's the Ink Puppet Painting Technique?\"\n\nKeegan pulled his lips flatly into his cheeks as he pondered how to simplify the explanation such that a child could understand. But right as he was doing so, Goran spoke up, \"It's similar to the technique you used to paint the Red Dragon Smaug. However, it is at a much higher level.\"\n\nKeegan cocked an eyebrow and asked, \"Does the boy know this technique?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. He has used a derivation of it before,\" Goran commented. He then looked at Kano who was struggling to stand on his tip-toes and offered assistance, \"Wait, I'll show you.\"\n\nGoran lifted Kano and placed him over his shoulders so that the boy could get a clearer view of Jo Way.\n\nJo Way pulsed a transparent string of mana into the pool of black ink that he had formed thoughtlessly. The stink started to coagulate into an undulating blob. The blob moved like slime on top of the sheet of paper. Interestingly, not a hint of black persisted as the blob traversed a beelining path. Once it arrived at the centre, the blob compressed, flattened, elongated and expanded in an uncoordinated, non-periodic fashion. As it did so, it left marks, slashes, dots and splotches of black. The abstract puzzle it formed incrementally started to take coherent shape as this exercise progressed.\n\n\"He is using his mana to control the ink. If you look carefully, you can observe that the ink isn't drying as fast as it should when on the paper. That is because he is also using his mana to control the rate at which the colour settles. The longer the ink remains liquid, the deeper the colour becomes,\" Goran explained.\n\n\"The Ink Puppet Painting Technique was created by Artist Laurence. He is actually Artist Norris' Master. This technique is best applied when the artist wants to create a painting quickly. As you can see, the method is fast and efficient. However, the disadvantage is that the artist must have the exact image in their mind right from the beginning, and must be aware of what is taking form on the paper as they are doing so. A single mistake can cause the entire painting to fall apart. On top of that, they need to sustain a steady stream of mana that is dispersed at varying densities across the painting surface. It is a high-level technique that has a steep learning curve. I didn't know that Jo Way had that in his toolbox - no wonder he was so confident,\" Goran added.\n\n\"His use of the technique is extremely refined,\" Keegan chimed in. \"The level of control he is exhibiting is indicative of years of experience and practice. How old is this lad?\"\n\nGoran smiled wryly as he answered, \"There is just a little less than a century between yours and his age, Artist Lang.\"\n\nKeegan's eyes widened in disbelief before he commented, \"Artist Norris dug his grave with this one. He basically handed the lad a sword and ran straight into it.\"\n\n\"But Artist Lang,\" Kano interjected. \"Didn't you say that an artist must stand their ground when someone challenges their skill?\"\n\nKeegan clicked his tongue and said, \"But one must also choose their fights carefully.\"\n\nKano couldn't get his head around the hypocritical statements from Artist Lang. His confused gaze was caught by Goran who simply offered a look that indicated, 'Just let it go.'\n\nUnsurprisingly, Jo Way was the first to finish his painting. Once the last mark was made by his now shrunken paint blob, he indicated his completion to the judges. Usually, in these duels, the time between the completion of both participants was never so exaggerated, because barely a quarter of the allotted time had passed and already one of the participants had finished their work. Artist Norris wasn't aware of this and was completely absorbed in his task. The audience and judges remained quiet to ensure that the artist wasn't disturbed. One of the judges swiftly moved an opaque cover over Jo Way's work to mask it from the audience - as custom the paintings had to be revealed at the same time.\n\nArtist Norris took the entire hour for his work. Right as the final sand particle in the hourglass descended into the lower chamber, Artist Norris raised his paintbrush and placed it carefully on the stand.\n\nThe judges repeated the same practice and covered Artist Norris' work as well. They then moved the two occluded paintings to a raised platform and adhered it in place.\n\nThe crowd moved closer with excitement as a primed silence pervaded the ambience. The audience moved aside to let Keegan, Goran and Kano through, while unwittingly blocking out Myron who barely understood what was going on. He was still confused over how the situation turned so drastically, it was supposed to be a one-sided verbal and moral lambasting of the boy his brother was sponsoring! Observing paintings was just a cover, why were they now actually doing it?!\n\nAfter the crowd settled, the judges made a move and revealed the painting simultaneously.\n\nThen, there was only silence.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-130]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":89,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 128 - Artist's Duel (Part One)","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nIn a world where martial might reigned supreme, a duel would often be associated with a bout between two individuals based on their martial prowess either to death or defeat. However, on the artistic stage, a duel held a completely different essence. On this stage, the goal was for the competitors to triumph over each other through their artistic skills alone - having superior strength held no meaning here.\n\nYet, one must know that losing the duel based on art often ended with the loser's entire career ending in jeopardy. That is, a budding artist would lose all credibility even before their career had a chance to take off while an established one would have their entire lives overturned in a single day. This is because the artists place the thing most valuable on the line when taking on the challenge: their reputation. Unlike with martial duels, where the loser either died or became disabled, a losing artist was wholly intact but had to live in a state of disgraced limbo. Their life would reach such a low point that they would wish they had just died that day.\n\nThe duel between artists has, and always will be, a sacred rite without room for negotiation. Unlike physical duels, this one must occur in a public setting with multiple artists - without conflicts of interest with the competitors - present and willing to judge to ensure the sanctity of the outcome.\n\nNeedless to say, because of the rigidity of this process, as well as the severe ramifications of suffering a defeat, an artist's duel was a rare occurrence. This was why everyone present in the Artists' Guild appeared so emotionally charged and excited for what may only occur once in their lifetimes.\n\n\"Who the heck is Jo Way?\"\n\n\"He's a 1-star Teacher from Radiant Academy.\"\n\n\"Hmm... I can't recollect this person... Anyways, why is he duelling against Artist Norris, who is a 3-star Artist? Is he also a 3-star Artist?\"\n\n\"HA! No, he's not even licensed to practise!\"\n\n\"Such guts?!\"\n\n\"I know right! This guy is asking for trouble, I tell ya! Asking to have his face dragged through the mud. Humph!\"\n\n\"Did he challenge Artist Norris?\"\n\n\"No, it was the other way around?\"\n\n\"Umm, isn't Artist Norris just bullying the weak like this?\"\n\n\"You don't know the full story! It all makes sense if you hear it...\"\n\nAnd then, the crowd member expounded on the events that led up to this incredulous competition between two individuals who were, on paper, at two different skill levels.\n\nApparently, Artist Norris was hired as a tutor for the second son of the Lionel Clan's Third Young Master. The boy was considered an artistic prodigy and the clan had to jump through a tonne of hoops to score this opportunity. On the day of the exhibition, Artist Norris was accompanying the boy around the hall, exposing him to the paintings when Teacher Way came around and openly criticised Arist Norris' opinions. No one could pinpoint for sure what events led to this happening. Different variations placed either of the parties in a better light. Ultimately, one thing led to another, and Artist Norris who had publicly lost face urged Teacher Way to compete against him in a duel, which the Teacher readily agreed to.\n\nHowever, after that, it appeared as though the Teacher didn't even know what an artist's duel was. In fact, he didn't even seem to know much about the nuances of painting and the techniques involved when someone asked him offhandedly.\n\n\"*Tsk* Young people are so arrogant,\" Keegan commented. \"Where is that man, Teacher Way?\"\n\nThe crowd member who had provided the earlier exposition volunteered, \"He excused himself to the guild's library. Needed some inspiration, he said.\"\n\n\"You said that he didn't even have a practitioner's license? What farce is this?!\" Keegan blurted out. \"Let's go back!\"\n\nRight as Keegan said those words, someone in the crowd exclaimed, \"That's Artist Keegan Lang!\"\n\n\"The 6-star artist? What's he doing here?\"\n\n\"Idiot! Don't you know that his latest work is hanging in the exhibition?\"\n\n\"It is? Why isn't it the main event?\"\n\nKeegan coughed to interrupt the line of questioning. He didn't want to relive that embarrassment again. Yet now that his attendance was made public, a person from the centre of the crowd walked forward and greeted him with a respectful bow, \"Artist Lang. It is an honour to meet you.\"\n\nThe man was Artist Norris, one of the participants of the duel. Keegan lightly nodded his head in acknowledgement.\n\n\"I humbly request that you act as one of the judges for this duel,\" Artist Norris continued.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nStumped, Artist Norris lowered his head further. He realised that he had let his hubris get the better of him, going as far as to make such a presumptuous request from a 6-star artist no less! That was three whole stars above him - what was he thinking?\n\n\"I-I-I-\"\n\nKeegan clicked his tongue and mocked, \"Yeah, I figured. You didn't even think, did you? Impulsive!\"\n\n\"W-W-What is going on?\" A meek voice vibrated from behind Keegan.\n\n\"That's Artist Norris, the person who is involved in the duel. He's asking Artist Lang to act as a mediator,\" Goran explained.\n\n\"Why are they competing through their painting?\" Kano asked while scratching his head in confusion. For him, drawing was a fun activity - something to be enjoyed. But the way things were being conducted before him, felt a bit stifling.\n\n\"One must be ready to stand their ground by virtue of their skills as an artist,\" Keegan answered while shaking his head. \"What would you do if someone less experienced than you, less learned than you, were to come forward and make libellous claims about your work?\"\n\n\"What should I do?\" Kano inquired with a blank expression. His eyes alternated between Goran and Keegan as though he were hoping to receive their opinions on the matter. This behaviour pleased Keegan as it indicated that Kano had acknowledged his skill and respected him.\n\n\"You must prove them wrong, of course!\"\n\n\"Ahh...\" Kano vocalised in understanding and nodded his head like a chicken pecking at grains. When they first met, Kano maintained caution when talking with or approaching Keegan. However, after walking around together and having a few intermittent exchanges, Kano had opened up a little and assumed his usual emotive persona. As Keegan gazed at the little boy with chubby, dimpled cheeks wearing a serious expression, he realised that the kid was kind of cute.\n\n\"But Artist Lang, why don't you want to help mediate the duel for Artist Norris? Isn't he doing e-e-exactly what you said someone should do in his place?\" Kano added with an innocent, curious gaze.\n\n\"I have better things to do, boy!\"\n\n\"You do? But weren't we just observing paintings? We can do that later too, right?\" Kano blurted out subconsciously. His face then drooped in disappointment.\n\n\"I kind of wanted to see how the duel would go...\" Kano sighed audibly and added, \"It sounded interesting...\"\n\nThe corner of Keegan's lips twitched slightly. Honestly, he wasn't really interested in the duel at all. To him, the conflict between artists below him was akin to a petty, phallus measuring competition. However, it was also true that he had nothing else to do for the time being. He was initially here to contend against the interloper who stole his spotlight, but now he was only remaining because he was vaguely interested in the boy. Keegan very much wanted to drag the kid back to his painting and hear his opinions, but Keegan also recognised that in doing so he would only sadden and distract him. Keegan hoped that the boy would drop the request so that he could save some face, but it didn't appear as though that was going to happen anytime soon. There was no malice or scheming in the boy's gaze, just raw curiosity, so Keegan didn't have a valid reason to stick to his earlier point.\n\n\"Fine, we can stay and watch,\" Keegan acquiesced with a sigh, and then declared to the crowd, \"I won't be acting as a judge. Find someone else for that!\"\n\nArtist Norris silently receded, rejoicing internally that his impulsive faux pas didn't end up damaging him.\n\n\"Where is the other one, anyway?\" Keegan grunted with irritation. He had been waiting for a little less than half an hour now, and he was growing increasingly agitated by the fact that the supposedly heated duel had entered a standstill even before it began.\n\n\"Did he run away?\" Someone commented.\n\n\"No. Someone from the guild is monitoring him. He's still in the library,\" another person answered.\n\n\"What's he doing in there? It looks to me like he's just wasting our time!\" The first person complained.\n\nRight then, the figure they were waiting for strolled with a nonchalant stride and his hands shoved deep into his jacket pockets.\n\nKano had heard of Teacher Jo Way before. He knew that his elder brother had lost to this person's student, so by default Kano had a poor opinion of the man. After observing him in person for the first time, Kano's dislike for the man was vastly exacerbated.\n\nIt is often stated that when one meets another person for the first time, they must aim to bring forward their best self. This is because people's opinion of you is primarily dependent on their first impressions. If you come across as amiable, they will feel more motivated to socialise with you. If instead, you come forth like a cold recluse, they will subconsciously distance themselves from you.\n\nKano's first impression of Jo Way was less than optimal. The man's gait was oozing with a kind of confidence that lacked substance. His face held a composure overflowing with toxic arrogance - the kind of arrogance that comes with being a prideful ignorant man. As Kano read the man's expressions, he observed that the man appeared unaffected and prepared for an unquestionable victory.\n\n\"Hmph! I thought you'd run away,\" Artist Norris taunted.\n\n\"What reason do I have to do that? I was the one who accepted your challenge, why would I run away?\" Jo Way retorted. He then continued by demanding, \"So, as the challenger, what conditions do you propose for the duel?\"\n\nArtist Norris sneered before listing the format for the duel.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-129]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":90,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 127 - Warming Up","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nKeegan looked at the kid named Kano and pondered over how he should handle the situation. The kid was currently reading a small handbook that every exhibition attendee was given, which detailed the history of the participants and explained their works. The boy slid the index finger of his right hand over the page and mumbled the word that was pointing at under his breath.\n\n\"This is the work of 3-star artist, Kenosha Nurn. It's called 'A Lone Lotus',\" Goran introduced the first displayed artwork out loud. He then turned to the boy and asked, \"What do you think?\"\n\nThe boy immediately started explaining the technicalities of the painting. The longer he spoke, Keegan's scrutinising gaze faltered.\n\n'He's knowledgeable,' Keegan thought to himself. As the boy continued, he started to enter territories that were quite advanced for artists, especially this early in their career. Keegan admitted that when he was the boy's age, even he couldn't recite all those details without missing a beat. Then again, Keegan didn't have access to the same resources as the boy.\n\n'That's right! He didn't have to struggle as I did,' Keegan said to himself to assuage his envy. For a second there, Keegan had nearly vocalised his fascination with the boy out loud.\n\nWhile the boy orated, Keegan battled internally over pointing out negligible misspeaks or errors to win one over him. But then he realised that his opponent was only a child, moreover, there was an age gap of around a century between them.\n\n\"Now, try doing what I told you to do before,\" Goran instructed after the boy finished. Kano nodded and stared at the painting thoughtfully. In between, the boy lowered his head and read the entry about the artist and her work in the book in his hand.\n\nKeegan carefully observed the boy's emotions and noticed that his frown deepened with every passing second.\n\n\"I c-c-can't make a connection,\" the boy admitted in defeat.\n\n\"That's okay. We'll keep going.\" And with that, they walked over to the next painting. This exercise continued one after the other. The boy would first dictate his observation about the artwork, barring some insights that were outside his reach since he wasn't a mage. After that, the boy would stare at the painting with a more intense gaze while intermittently alternating between the book in his hand and the painting.\n\nAs they moved around, Keegan's internal conflict was reaching a boiling point. 'What am I even doing here, following a kid like this? What am I hoping to achieve?!'\n\nIn fact, while initially, Keegan had arrived with a metaphorical sword in hand, after observing the boy's diligence and willingness to learn, he slowly mellowed out. During the transition between paintings, Keegan even posed a few easy questions to gauge the boy's capacity and was further impressed. The kid wasn't half bad - in Keegan's opinion.\n\n\"What's the boy trying to do?\" Keegan asked Goran with a low whisper. While some of the topics Kano pointed out and discussed with Goran involved artistic techniques beyond the ordinary level, they didn't offer anything new for Keegan. He was more interested in the instruction Goran relayed at the end of each viewing.\n\n\"I'm teaching Kano to exercise his artistic philosophy,\" Goran answered flatly.\n\n\"So early?\" An artistic philosophy is an advanced concept usually left for artists who have earned a few stars in their licenses. To introduce it to someone who was yet to step into the official path was peculiar.\n\nGoran nodded with a proud smile and said, \"The boy is beyond his years. Artist Lang should have seen it already. You wouldn't believe it if I told you that he learned all of that in the last few weeks alone.\"\n\nNow that WAS inconceivable!\n\nGoran noticed Keegan's disbelief and said, \"He's extremely talented, this one.\"\n\n\"So what is his philosophy?\" Keegan inquired immediately.\n\n\"Hmm, I believe it's best if you ask him directly,\" Goran deferred. He then moved towards Kano and urged him forward.\n\n\"The next painting is Artist Lang's. It will be far, far superior to the ones we've seen before. It will also be spiritually active, thus I will be monitoring you so that you don't lose yourself in it.\"\n\nBefore they could proceed, Kano jolted his head towards Goran and said, \"Wait! I think I have something. Give me a minute, please. I just need to confirm it!\"\n\nAs Keegan looked into the boy's animated eyes, he was taken over by their liveliness. This was a lad who really loved to paint - Keegan could just tell by the animated excitement surging from his ebullience.\n\n'I don't even feel this way about my works,' Keegan sighed in shame. Even though he was a 6-star Artist, he never had the same level of enthusiasm the boy displayed for a split second before running off.\n\nFrom his side, Keegan suddenly heard a tongue click, \"How disrespectful! Who does the boy think he is, keeping Artist Lang waiting like this?\"\n\nIt was Myron, who was trying to add oil to the nearly extinguished flame. Keegan wasn't oblivious to Myron's attempts at antagonising him against the boy. It was just that earlier, Keegan had a legitimate reason to go along. But now, it just seemed so trivial. Besides, after suppressing his senseless rage, he realised that Goran wasn't someone who would put Kano in such a controversial position. He was methodically taking Kano through the different artworks and encouraging the boy to exercise his knowledge. What benefit would moving the kid's unpolished painting to such a public stage offer in his development, unless it was some sort of a sick exercise in building humility? Not like the kid even needed it; he was already so unbearably soft-spoken, not an ounce of youthful hot-headedness lay within his bones. Keegan tried to reprimand the boy once for a small error, only to receive an immediate and heartfelt apology - it was like punching cotton! This ultimately meant that someone else was involved in slighting Keegan. After some trite mental calculation, he figured out that the 'someone' responsible was standing right next to him and egging him on.\n\nJust as Keegan was about to speak and reprimand Myron, Kano toddled back with an excited expression and urged Goran to take him to the next painting.\n\nSince they were approaching his work, Keegan subconsciously became more receptive to his audience's opinions and expressions. He was especially interested in what the kid had to say. Evidently, the boy had made some breakthrough in unearthing his artistic philosophy, and Keegan was looking forward to hearing what it was.\n\nKeegan held little connection to his work. Sure it was a level five masterpiece, but it wasn't anything special to him. The observers didn't share this opinion - to them the work was transformative and extremely valuable. Because of his usual indifference, his works never had a name, just a numeric designation. The one on display right now was \"Number 23\".\n\nThe scene was of a lone farmer toiling in a lavish field of gold and green. As Kano looked at the sole individual, the man turned his head and looked out. He took out a towel stuffed into the back of his pants and brought it over to his face to dab away the overflowing sweat. He had a shovel in his hands, that he planted directly into the soil, letting it stand vertically. He folded his hands, rested them over the vertical wooden handle and waved out towards Kano. With each passing second, Kano could feel the world around him change, from the modestly cool exhibition hall to a welcoming and encouraging warmth beating down from the Sun. The still air started to course in a pleasant breeze, carrying an aroma of freshly cut grass that immediately assaulted Kano's nose. The sound of metal colliding against the soil reverberated in the background, suppressed by the calm whooshing of the swaying wheat stalks.\n\nThe next wave brought with it a rush of emotions. The fulfilment that followed a battery of hard work, the joy from receiving the payment from a hard day's work, and the tranquillity that was offered by a filling meal with the entire family.\n\nThe farmer in the distance approached Kano and offered him a stalk of wheat. Kano didn't know what it meant and stared at the man with a vacant gaze. In response, the man simply placed the stalk in his mouth and started chewing on it. He handed Kano another one before laying down on the ground and staring into the clear blue sky.\n\nMost others, uninitiated to the rapture of a painting at the pinnacle of contemporary art, would've been completely enraptured by this experience - lost within the painting's microcosm. But surprisingly, Kano wasn't. He was pulled into this little world at a spiritual level, but not once did he mistake it for reality. There were signs, subtle indications that the world around him was a result of a myriad of brushstrokes and artificial colours. The sky's blue-ness was slightly lacking, the grass' green-ness was a little washed, the wheat's gold-ness was a tad flat. Every single colour in this world was close, but a fraction of a step short. It didn't detract from the appeal of this veritable masterpiece of a painting - one that stood at the top of the contemporary styles.\n\nAll this while, Keegan was doggedly observing the transition of expressions on Kano's face. It started with a contemplative frown, which slowly loosened to unrestrained awe, finally warping at an exponential rate towards an assured resoluteness.\n\n\"Did you make a connection?\" Goran asked.\n\nKano nodded enthusiastically and said, \"I see it! I've figured out a connection with my philosophy!\"\n\nKeegan's curiosity overtook his self-control urging him to inquire, \"Can you explain it to me?\"\n\nRight as Kano prepared to answer, a series of hasty conversations broke through the respectful silence.\n\n\"Quickly now! It's at the centre of the quad!\"\n\n\"I never thought that something so exciting like an Artists' Duel would take place today of all days!\"\n\nThe occupants within the hall were absorbed by the hubbub and, like sheep, followed the crowd exiting hurriedly.\n\nMyron stopped the nearest individual and demanded clarification, \"What's going on? Where is everyone running off to?\"\n\n\"It's an Artists' Duel. Artist Norris challenged Teacher Way to it. It's taking place in the quad!\" The man answered before receding with a brisk jog.\n\n\"Who's Teacher Way?\" Myron muttered.\n\nGoran recollected only one Teacher Way, \"It's Jo Way.\"\n\n\"\"\"Who?\"\"\" Kano, Keegan, and Myron blurted out in unison.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-128]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":91,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 126 - Petty Tactics","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nMyron choked on his words and descended into a violent coughing fit, arousing the attention of others around him. Goran didn't bother to wait for him to calm down and turned to leave.\n\n\"Wait! *cough* big -\"\n\n\"Clan Leader,\" Goran corrected as though it were second nature, which essentially was the case for him by now. The interjection didn't help Myron's recovery and exacerbated his frenzied coughs.\n\n\"Tsk! Act more appropriately, will you?! You're embarrassing the clan!\" Goran reprimanded, eliciting a malicious, red-eyed and tear-filled stare from his hunched over brother.\n\n\"You're in the Core Condensation realm for goodness sake!\" Goran reminded. Myron caught on to this hint, surprisingly, and immediately activated his mana circulation. After a short half-minute, he calmed down and exhaled loudly to regulate his breath.\n\n\"Clan Leader,\" Myron started, eyeing Goran with a hateful gaze. \"Ah! Is this the little artist?\" He exclaimed and shifted his gaze towards Kano. Noticing the man's hostile intentions, Kano slowly slid behind Goran.\n\n\"This is the artist whose work is taking the centre stage today, Artist Lang!\" Myron turned and commented. From behind him, an elderly looking individual, with an imposing aged-silver coloured beard and a haughty gaze, walked forward with his hands clasped behind him. The man called Artist Keegan Lang looked towards the little child and observed him with great intensity. Within a short second, the man had already inspected the boy from top to bottom using his mana sense and, after finding nothing of value, snorted derisively.\n\nMyron wore a proud smirk and glanced at Goran. Goran realised that Myron had taken his earlier \"advice\" quite seriously, and went out of his way to bring in an expert. Well, calling Artist Lang an expert would be an understatement; the man was a veritable master in his craft. He currently held a 6-star license, evidence of the fact that he could create artworks at the fifth level consistently. Goran actually owned a few paintings of Artist Lang, including the man's very first fifth level painting, and they hung within a secure vault in the Rasmus Clan's territory.\n\n\"Artist Lang! What a wonderful surprise,\" Goran greeted as he stepped forward with a jovial smile. Kano observed that there was an undertone of respect and adoration in Goran's voice - he truly meant it when he said that - which was in contrast to his attitude earlier when meeting others. And this was because Goran actually admired the talent of the man before him.\n\n\"Clan Leader Rasmus,\" Artist Lang replied with a smile filled with a contrast of emotions. Kano sensed reverence and respect, as well as a tinge of animosity in the man's tone. The resentment didn't seem like it was directed towards Goran, though, which confused Kano even further.\n\n\"Kano come, greet Artist Lang,\" Goran instructed and moved the meek boy forward. Kano, in turn, walked up with a lowered head and bowed profusely.\n\n\"It is an honour to m-m-meet you, Artist L-L-Lang,\" the boy said in a low voice. In response, the boy simply received a curt hum from the man. It was then that Kano realised that the earlier hostility was directed at him! The resentment was so telegraphed that even Goran picked up on this minor interaction and immediately moved forward to shift the topic.\n\n\"I apologise for cutting this meeting short. We were planning to peruse the works in the exhibition, so we shall be taking our leave,\" Goran said and bade Artist Lang a hurried farewell. They had arrived right just a few hours before the exhibition opened. Being a VVIP, Goran had the privilege of appreciating the artworks peacefully before the common riffraff.\n\n\"Why don't we join the Clan Leader and the little artist, Artist Lang?\" Myron said in a feigned suggestive tone. He didn't wait for the recipient's affirmation and immediately started to follow Goran.\n\nGoran sighed in annoyance and walked in. Right as they entered the hall, Goran noticed a bizarre scene with the employees of the guild moving around frantically. He observed them and realised that they were replacing the signs reading \"Main Exhibition: Artist Keegan Lang\" with \"Main Exhibition: Kano Reva\".\n\nHe then tuned in to the conversations bubbling amongst the visitors in the hall and heard the full story.\n\n\"*Tsk* What's wrong with the guild? They moved Artist Lang's works to a lower slot in place of a complete novice! Who even is this Kano Reva?\"\n\n\"Shh! Apparently, they're in bed with some bigshots...\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't say...\"\n\n\"Just spill it! Damn it!\"\n\n\"Alright, alright! It's the Rasmus Clan!\"\n\n\"No way! If Clan Leader Rasmus is sponsoring this artist, he must be pretty good.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Let's go check it out first!\"\n\nWith a forceful growl, Goran jolted his head backwards and interrogated Myron, \"What have you done?!\"\n\n\"Big brother,\" Myron started. He paused for a half-second by instinct, noticing that Goran hadn't corrected him like an imbecile, he celebrated internally and said, \"since you were debuting your sponsored artist, I figured you would want his work to take the centre stage. So I asked the guild to make the change, for which they readily obliged as you are their foremost patron.\"\n\n\"So you replaced a 6-star artist's painting with that of someone who hasn't even earned a Practicing license, and used the clan's name for this?\" Goran reaffirmed with an exhausted voice. He finally realised the cause of Artist Lang's ire. He had been upstaged by a literal nobody! Of course, the artist couldn't take it out on the people who implemented this, since it was equivalent to taking on the entire Rasmus Clan, all the man could do was direct his displeasure towards the dastardly interloper, which was Kano.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to observing 'artist' Reva's work,\" Artist Lang commented as he walked in behind Myron. When he said the word artist, there was a clear sarcastic edge in it.\n\nWhile Myron revelled over his supposed victory, Goran immediately started to ponder over how to resolve the incoming conflict. The people with a lot of clout in a particular field, though wise, were often petty. They never appreciated it if someone they deemed a 'greenhorn' opposed them or made them lose face. Goran could already anticipate the amount of contention Kano would encounter in the future in the hands of Artist Lang if the current fray wasn't settled appropriately.\n\nIn the end, Goran couldn't come up with anything. For the first time, he had been bested by Myron in a diplomatic battle.\n\n'I was too careless,' he thought as he gazed apologetically at Kano.\n\n\"Why don't we study artist Kano's work?\" Myron suggested rhetorically.\n\n\"That's not necessary,\" Goran denied curtly. \"We are here to learn from the works of others not stroke our own ego, isn't that right Kano?\"\n\nKano nodded vehemently with a serious expression.\n\n____\n\nKeegan would be lying if he said that he wasn't affected by everything that transpired today. The exhibition at Radiant City's Artists' Guild was a huge event that garnered a lot of attention. It was where veteran and up-and-coming artists would come to showcase their mettle, and possibly make huge sales with the high-rollers that attended intending to procure the latest masterpieces.\n\nHowever, a 6-star artist such as himself wouldn't usually bother to participate in such clownish events. Why would they bother placing their transcendent works amongst the lower tier trash? To put it simply, it would be analogous to a dragon flaunting its might amongst ants. But Keegan was different. He didn't care much about such trivial beliefs and practices, all he cared about was the money. The only reason he was taking part in this event was to offload his newest painting with a lucrative sale.\n\nKeegan wasn't short on funds, he was as rich as any other Artist in his position could be. Yet, he was wanting for more. Every once in a while, Keegan would get this prickly feeling of insecurity. That at any moment, all the money in his bank account would just disappear. Whenever that feeling rose within him, he would rush over to his studio and lock himself for months on end, only to exit after he had created another masterpiece level-five artwork. He would then sell the work to fuse an influx of cash into his account. Only then would his insecurity subside.\n\nIncidentally, Keegan wanted to try something different this time and decided to advertise his new work in Radiant City's exhibition rather than through the usual auction. The Guild was rightfully elated to host Keegan, after all, it wasn't like every 6-star artist would willingly publicly advertise their works.\n\nBut just before the day of the exhibition, his position was switched with that of another, unlicensed artist. It was blasphemy of the highest order! He was prepared to unleash his complete fury on the guild for such an unceremonious sleight, but he realised that the perpetrators were one of his highest-paying clients: the Rasmus Clan. Knowing who they were, Keegan wasn't surprised that the guild sided with them rather than him.\n\nHe couldn't afford to oppose them, not if he was prepared to lose a lucrative source of income. But that didn't mean that he was ready to drop his displeasure towards the miscreant who made him lose face so spectacularly. Keegan should have and was planning to immediately void his participation, but Keegan was somehow convinced by Myron Rasmus to attend the exhibition and destroy the artist's reputation personally. \n\nAt that time, he was prepared to tear the artist a new one publicly and end his entire career, until he realised that his so-called 'opponent' was just a little kid. How small-minded would he be if he was ready to go up in arms against him?\n\nInternally, Keegan slammed his past self for becoming so embroiled in his anger that he had become swayed by Myron's obvious attempts to incite a pointless conflict. Because now, Keegan was feeling extremely regretful.\n\nBut Keegan's pride stopped him from doubling back. Since he had made a declaration with such conviction, he would lose too much face if he gave up without putting even a little bit of effort. So Keegan decided, rather half-heartedly, that he had to do something, albeit only in ceremony, to humble the boy.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-127]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":92,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 125 - Artistic Philosophy","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nFor the first time in his life, Kano was feeling dissatisfied with his work. Back in the village, whenever Kano drew something, painted something, or even modelled something out of clay, he never felt such a loathsome emotion every time he looked at it. But just yesterday, as he gazed at his wall-painting of Smaug being carted off towards the exhibition, he felt disgusted.\n\n\"What's the matter? Why the long face?\" Mister Rasmus asked him from his side. Currently, the two were on a carriage ride towards the Artist's Guild within Radiant City for the exhibition.\n\nKano snapped out of his dismayed trance and exhaled loudly, \"D-D-Do we have to show my painting at the exhibition?\"\n\nIn fact, Kano learned about the specifics of the exhibition just two days ago. He didn't know that his work was also going to be up for display! He thought that the purpose of coming to the city was to broaden his horizon by observing different artworks, and according to Mister Rasmus that was the original plan. However, through some rather annoying circumstances, Mister Rasmus was forced to push Kano into the spotlight and publicise his painting of Smaug, which Mister Rasmus had transported from his village.\n\n\"We have a slot. We kind of have to,\" Mister Rasmus affirmed. \"Are you feeling apprehensive about it?\"\n\nKano nodded lightly with a deep frown.\n\n\"And why is that?\" Mister Rasmus urged again, with a faint smile on his face - Kano was too absorbed in his own troubles to notice it.\n\n\"I d-d-don't know... When I first painted Smaug, I was really excited. I liked it a lot. I felt that it was a good painting. B-B-But now... I guess I don't like it as much?\" Kano said while scrunching his nose.\n\n\"What did I tell you about being descriptive with our words?\" Mister Rasmus responded sternly.\n\n\"Well... Suddenly, I feel like my work isn't as good as I thought it would be. There are so many mistakes and shortcomings that I could have avoided. And it's so... basic!\" Kano rattled off briskly.\n\nBack in the village, Kano had stumbled along the path of visual arts purely by feel and intuition. He did what he \"felt\" was right; he applied \"techniques\" that worked through natural experimentation. Because of that, every new work he created was amazing in his eyes. But after travelling to Radiant City, learning about painting techniques with Mister Goran, and perusing the textbooks sent over by Teacher Larks, Kano realised that he was like the frog trapped in the well from the fables.\n\n\"It's only natural,\" Mister Rasmus replied, causing Kano to jerk his head and face him in surprise. \"Just like everything, art is all about growth. No one is born perfect. Even those with innate talent need to put some effort to unearth it and polish it. Along the path to improvement they inevitably have to make mistakes. If people don't make mistakes they won't learn and improve. You hate your earlier work because it is filled with imperfections in your eyes. Don't fetter over the fact that you were a poor artist back then. Look at it from a different perspective: you only notice these imperfections because you are a better artist now!\"\n\n\"But still... I feel like I could've done so m-m-much more with it,\" Kano admitted with a pout. \"My interpretation is so superficial!\"\n\nThe reason why Kano absorbed literature so avariciously, especially the fiction books provided by Teacher Larks, was because of how the authors used words to paint a picture in the reader's minds that could sometimes extend beyond the surface-level interpretation. More specifically, Kano was enthralled by the works of some authors who would use stylistic devices, diction, sentence structure, etc. with such skill that it threw him for a loop with each repeated reading. To an extent, Kano was envious of these authors because he knew that he lacked the capacity to craft thought-provoking proses using words.\n\nBUT, thanks to the textbooks sent by Teacher Larks, Kano was given new hope. He realised that visual arts could also be used as a medium to evoke deeper thought. In fact, Kano felt that he was close to scratching the surface of this new avenue with his Smaug wall-painting, nonetheless, he had still fallen short by a decent margin. For one, he realised that his understanding of Smaug was too shallow. Smaug the dragon was much more than just a calamitous beast. He was the reckoning of the dwarves who had succumbed to their endless greed. This wasn't the first time the dwarves had perished through overindulgence in the sin of avarice. At a later date, the inhabitants of Moria too had been smothered by endless fire and darkness after mining too deeply. By using the skills Kano picked up from the books, he could have altered the perception of the character in his painting in an interesting way!\n\nMister Rasmus snapped his fingers and declared excitedly, \"Keep that thought in mind at all times! The words you have just spoken are the basis of your artistic pursuit, your philosophy. Every artist has a philosophy that guides their journey. To improve a technique, to develop a new technique, to explore ways to create certain kinds of moods, modelling specific creatures, are some examples of artistic philosophies. Of course, these philosophies are subject to change as the artists advance through the ranks and gain more insight into their craft.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand, Mister Rasmus,\" Kano said with slightly furrowed brows.\n\n\"What do you want to achieve as an artist?\"\n\n\"I want... my artworks to resonate with the audience,\" Kano said with some uncertainty.\n\n\"Too vague. Try elaborating it,\" Mister Rasmus guided.\n\nKano hummed contemplatively before speaking with a measured intonation, \"It's like this: when you look at an artwork you observe what is shown, which encompasses all aspects ranging from the techniques used, colour, content, composition and so on. When someone looks at my work, I want them to see more than just that. I want them to think about what they are seeing. What it means not just in general, but to them.\"\n\n\"That's good! You are close, but I can still see some ambiguity in your words,\" Mister Rasmus said. \"I want you to do the following when we enter the exhibition, every time we see a new painting I want you to evaluate it with your artistic philosophy in mind. Ask yourself how the painting would relate to your philosophy if it even relates to your philosophy, and what you could do differently to tie it with your philosophy?\"\n\nJust as he finished, the carriage started to decelerate. \n\n\"Clan Leader Rasmus, we have arrived at the Artists' Guild,\" the carriage driver indicated with an audible and respectful tone.\n\nUnlike most other guild buildings in the city, the Artists' Guild opted for a flatter design. That is, while the others built up, the Artists chose to build out. Given the lack of, and the high price of, land within Radiant City, it was nothing short of a miracle how the Artists' Guild managed to secure such a large swatch of real-estate and that too at one of the most high-traffic areas of the city. One advantage the Artists' Guild branch had over the others was that it was one of the oldest established branches in the city. Being the first, they had managed to grab a lion's share before the other swooped in and staked their claim.\n\nKano and Mister Rasmus alighted right in front of the building's entrance. The gate into the building appeared to be made of wood, with intricate inlays, models and designs sprawling over it evoking a sense of tranquil elegance. Upon passing through the gates, Kano realised that the guild's building had a U-shaped design, with a wall at the open end acting as the entrance, where he was currently standing. At the open space in the centre was a beautifully maintained small landscape. It was like a scene captured from his village near the spring. A small brook flowed through the centre of the landscape, bisecting it in half. The regions it passed through formed a serene rocky meadow, with a wooden walkway arching over the brook to allow passage back and forth. There was a myriad of colourful flowers, bushes, small fauna, and trees that grew only as high as the roof of the flanking building. From Kano's position, he couldn't see the end of the small forest which spoke a lot about just how wide the building itself was.\n\n\"The quadrangle is a gathering place for the artists registered with the guild. Here they are free to socialise, relax, or even sketch. Spell circles are lining the boundaries that inhibit sounds from entering the quadrangle, there are a few other circles that discourage excessive damage due to hotheaded conflicts between artists as well,\" Mister Rasmus explained.\n\n\"It's weird,\" Kano commented. \"Why are they going through so much trouble to bring in nature into the city, when there is nature already present outside?\"\n\n\"Convenience. Most artists aren't as adventurous and prefer to stay within the safety of walls,\" Mister Rasmus replied.\n\n\"But you said that an artist must explore the world and learn more about it to grow,\" Kano reasoned.\n\n\"I don't want to judge other artists through my lens. Everyone has a process, and what I've taught you is just one of the many. It may work for you, and it may not, you can only know after trying.\"\n\nKano hummed and followed Mister Rasmus through the hallways bordering the quadrangle. Along the way, Mister Rasmus bumped into many people he seemingly spoke intimately with, but Kano observed that he wasn't being sincere. This was Kano's first time witnessing the art of doublespeak in person, and he wasn't feeling too fond of it.\n\nThe walk was long, and it was not helped by the fact that a lot of people were interested in reacquainting themselves with the leader of the Rasmus Clan. Due to Kano's generally small stature and unnoticeable aura, he was easily overlooked by those approaching Mister Rasmus. But his luck wouldn't last, as just when they reached the double doors leading to the exhibition hall, a nasal voice laced with disdain and mockery called out from behind.\n\n\"Ah! Big bro-\"\n\n\"Clan Leader.\" Mister Rasmus interrupted immediately and without turning around, as though he knew exactly who was calling out to him just from the tonal shift of the first syllables from the person's mouth.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-126]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":93,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 124 - Do Not Try This At Home (Redux)","n":0.316},"1":{"v":"\nElaborating on the compartmentalisation spellcasting process was easier for Markus because he played a crucial role in its development. Jean could hear the pride in Markus' voice as he accentuated certain nuances, and offered his personal insights. During this, Markus ensured that the explanation did not extend beyond Jean's level by peppering small anecdotes and relatable examples, just as he'd learned from Teacher Larks.\n\nAfter a quick half an hour, Markus separated himself from Jean. \"Let us follow the standard scientific process. Here, catch!\" He commanded while tossing a small ball of coal towards Jean.\n\n\"Start by casing a standard |Fireball| but use a physical Source Component targetting this coal,\" he instructed.\n\nJean cast the |Fireball| using her wand, and flicked the materialised ball towards the rock outcrop. This time, the ball hurtled at a straight path and collided against the surface with an audible bang.\n\n\"Awesome! Now follow the steps for compartmentalisation,\" he instructed.\n\nJean nodded and exhaled loudly to centre her mind. She recollected Markus' earlier explanation and started by simultaneously constructing two spell circles with her will. As Jean finalised the spell circles she materialised it through practice, except she focused on two different points. The first was at the mana gem at the wand base, for the targeting and projection components. The second was from her core, which initiated from her shoulder and moved towards the wand. The two spell circles collided and joined together to form one which reached the tip of the wand, before getting activated with Jean's mana.\n\nRight as the |Fireball| formed, Jean heard a warning from Markus, \"Don't get excited and lose your focus!\"\n\nJean grasped her faltering mind and flicked the ball as practised towards the rock outcrop, the result matched her earlier attempt.\n\nMarkus approached Jean while asking, \"Did you notice the difference?\"\n\n\"The mana consumption... it was significantly lower,\" Jean affirmed.\n\n\"Exactly! By offloading the targeting and projection components, which tend to consume exponentially greater mana at your stage, to the mana gem, we reduce the overall mana consumption from your pool. Compartmentalisation is a huge boon for mages. At my level, I can cast over five hundred |Fireball| spells in succession before completely depleting my mana. And that is with a transmutation Source Component, with a physical one I can go for a few hundred more!\"\n\nJean's eyes widened slightly in shock.\n\n\"If instead of the earlier targetting and projection components, you use these,\" Markus said as he pointed to a new page in his grimoire which contained two different spell circles, \"it reduces the mana consumption even further!\"\n\n\"What's the difference between these circles and the one earlier?\"\n\n\"The one which I taught you is tailored specifically for that specific type of |Fireball| spell. It will be impossible to apply it for any other projectile type spells. However, this one is a universal type which can be used with any projectile spells,\" Markus explained.\n\nJean tilted her head before commenting, \"But these are two different spell circles, how did you confirm this given our limit?\"\n\n\"That's the bottleneck. You see, thanks to the wand, we at the Mana Condensation realm can sustain two spell circles simultaneously even though the limit is one. However, Master tried out my theory and confirmed that using these two circles for targetting and projection, as well as a third circle for the spell itself, the mana consumption becomes unbelievably lower!\"\n\nJean hummed contemplatively, as she pondered over the revelation. She then pointed out, \"Here's the thing though, I agree that further compartmentalisation improves spell efficiency, however, is it worth it? I mean, at higher realms, you have significantly larger mana pools which can be used to leverage the mana consumption of spells without excessive compartmentalisation. Besides, will we even need wands at higher levels? It seems as though these are mainly crutches to allow us to advance at this stage of mage .\"\n\nMarkus shook his head immediately before declaring, \"That's where you are wrong, Junior Sister. The possibilities the wand offers are immeasurable, and so are the prospects from further compartmentalisation. In fact, the two in conjunction can even allow you to cast spell multiple levels beyond your own AND spells that are attuned to special 'elements', natures or even bloodlines.\"\n\nJean's unwavering expression didn't completely occlude her confusion from Markus' perception. Somehow, after teaching Jean for so long, he had become more aware of her limits of comprehension, as well as her subconscious behaviours and ticks. Markus smiled slyly before walking further away, in the direction of the stream. He turned to face Jean and began orating.\n\n\"By increasingly compartmentalising a spell, although we increase the number of spell circles, we are reducing their intricacy. This trade-off makes it palatable for a mage at the lower realms who have a limit on the number of spells they can sustain.\"\n\nAs he said this, Markus started to cast a new spell. It started with three small spell circles forming simultaneously from the base of the magic wand, and blooming outwards circularly around his wrists.\n\n\"On top of that, the larger mana gem with the fluid enchantment offers a greater surface to sustain multiple smaller spell circles as long as they are arranged in a mathematically compact orientation, and you don't mess it up during their formation of course.\"\n\nMarkus' face scrunched up with great discomfort as a fourth spell circle began to form and descend from his shoulders. It didn't stop there, though! Markus grunted audibly before generating a fifth, large spell circle that could encompass all four within it, and pushing it down from his left shoulder.\n\n\"Quickly cast a |Fireball| and project it at me!\" He commanded in a strained voice.\n\n\"But-\"\n\n\"DO IT!\"\n\nJean caught herself quickly and started to cast a |Fireball| through practice. She decided to go with the easier, non-compartmentalised, method to avoid mistakes. She didn't miss the fact that the Senior Brother had essentially cast five simultaneous spell circles, which were said to be beyond the limits of a Late-stage Mana Condensation realm mage, well into the Internal stage of Foundation establishment (a step above Teacher Larks' current cultivation level). She could already fathom the difficulty of this attempt.\n\n'He must be straining his will to its limits in doing this. Senior Brother is so... Awesome!' she celebrated with amazement.\n\nThe |Fireball| was formed and, with a flick, hurtled towards Markus.\n\nRight as the ball left the tip of Jean's wand, Markus activated the spell circles and pushed them forward. The spell circles on his right hand with the wand formed a diagram with a large central circle containing smaller equally sized circles with their centres at its circumference at the bearing 0-degrees, 120-degrees, and 240-degrees. This collided with the larger spell circle, which contained multiple components lined along the periphery, from his left hand. They joined together in front of him, to form a massive spell circle that started to rotate agitatedly. As it activated, and the purple ethereal diagram was illuminated, an ungodly screeching resonated from it.\n\nMarkus grit his teeth and circulated even more of his mana towards the spell circle, which quickly formed a small dark point, the same size as the tip of a pin, at its centre.\n\nThe screeching grew in volume markedly, as Markus could feel air gushing towards the point uninhibitedly. Right then, the hurtling ball of fire collided against the point, causing the screeching noise to quieten slightly. The |Fireball| whirled in place as the flames started getting siphoned into the point voraciously. Even the dirt from the ground wasn't saved from the point's suction, as specks started to rise and rush towards the minuscule maw!\n\nAs Markus observed this reaction, he was brought back to his fight against Gaige. Back then, all of his attacks were easily extinguished and consumed by a curtain of avaricious darkness. The point was close, but it still wasn't the same! Something in his mind told him that it was only a weak replica of that attack, and insignificant compared to the black hole he'd seen before. He was overcome with disappointment at his spell's performance.\n\nThe moment of distraction was enough for his spell to waver. The small black point started to vibrate.\n\n\"Oh no!\"\n\nBOOM!\n\nAn explosion surged outwards as the point expanded instantly. The sonic boom that followed pushed Markus back and flung him into the flowing stream behind. Thankfully, Jean was at a safe distance away and quickly collapsed towards the ground on her stomach.\n\n\"S-Senior Brother!\" Jean coughed out instinctively.\n\n\"I'm okay!\" Markus groaned as he rose from the flowing stream.\n\nA short second following that, the hurried figures of Al and Guy descended upon the scene, worry plastered across their faces. It didn't take long for them to put together the situation after observing the surroundings. Guy's face warped into a defeated frown before he growled, \"Markus!\"\n\n\"I-I can explain, Master!\" Markus quickly vocalised.\n\n\"Oh, you better! What the heck was that screeching sound? And the explosion?!\"\n\n\"Teacher Larks,\" Jean quickly interjected. \"Senior Brother replicated the spell Gaige used!\"\n\n\"Not exactly-\" Markus tried to explain, but he was immediately interrupted by an agitated Al. \"You did what? Quick, show it to me!\"\n\nMarkus wanted to properly elucidate them about his spell, but Al was having none of it! Markus sighed in defeat and simply produced the spell circles he used from his grimoire.\n\nWith a maniacal chuckle, Al started to cast the spell. He didn't need to use a wand, nor did he need to use multiple hands. The entire ensemble was formed instantaneously in his right hand.\n\nMarkus inconspicuously shuffled away from Al and pulled Jean and Guy with him. Al followed up immediately by activating the spell circle. As he did so, a much louder screeching noise resonated from the spell circle, causing the others present to cover their ears in pain.\n\n\"HA!\" Al exclaimed as a black point materialised at the centre of the spell circle.\n\n\"HAHAHAHAHA!\" Al continued as he pushed the black point towards the ground. As it descended, the point consumed the soil and drilled further and further downwards.\n\n\"It works! AMAZING!\" Al emoted.\n\nAs this was happening, Guy noticed Markus' strained expression.\n\n\"What's wrong? The spell works, why are you so distressed?\" He asked.\n\n\"The spell is incomplete,\" he confessed while screaming over the muffled screech. \"It isn't the same as Gaige's attack...\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well... After some thought, I realised that Gaige's attack wasn't how a black hole worked. All the matter and energy that was consumed simply disappeared, releasing nothing. That's not what a black hole does. A black hole emits radiation and energy.\" Markus explained.\n\n\"That makes sense.\"\n\n\"I figured that there were probably other mechanisms at work there apart from just absorption. Maybe he dissipated the energy over the blanket of darkness after disintegrating the matter and energy. Anyways, I decided to pivot and focus on the principles of how a black hole works. You see this spell generates a point that absorbs all matter that enters it and compresses it infinitely. This process is sustained by how much mana a mage can continuously expend,\" Markus continued.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"But what happens when the mage runs out of mana? Or they stop the spell?\" Markus concluded.\n\n\"Then everything that's within... Oh shit!\"\n\nGuy immediately grabbed his two students and rushed out.\n\n\"Heh? Where did they go?\" Al commented as he noticed the missing audience. He shrugged and decided that it was time to cancel the spell, seeing as it was consuming exponentially more mana as it progressed.\n\nBOOOOOOOOOOM!\n\nAn earthshattering explosion blossomed from the clearing. A large swatch of the forest was overturned. The stream had been rerouted as well. Thankfully the explosion didn't reach the village. Yet the aftershock did cause a few structures to shift and collapse. To this date, no one knew exactly what caused this because the only people complicit in this incident kept their mouths shut, and were prepared to take it to their graves.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-125]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":94,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 123 - Explaining Compartmentalisation","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nJean's face failed to betray her elation, as she held her own wand in her hands. She had only witnessed it a few times in her Senior Brother's possession and only observed it in use once during the combat between him and Gaige Bori in the recording artefact. Now that one lay in her hands, especially one that belonged solely to her, she couldn't wait to brandish it.\n\n\"Yours is a little shorter, compared to Markus',\" Teacher Larks explained. \"I felt it would feel more comfortable given your shorter arm length.\"\n\nJean nodded in affirmation, \"It's perfect.\"\n\n\"I know that you're probably excited about getting your own wand,\" Teacher Larks continued, reading her mind. \"So, let's cancel today's session. I'll leave you with Markus.\"\n\nTeacher Larks turned to Senior Brother, who was inspecting his updated wand with a much larger mana gem at its base and instructed, \"Markus, I want you to take Jean through the basics about how to use the wand. Cover the basics only. We will expand on the intricacies together, just get her up and running for now. Go to the clearing in the woods, and avoid excessively damaging spells, okay?\"\n\n____\n\n\"Let's recap. Can you explain the base concept of magic?\"\n\n\"Magic is the process of twisting the truths of the world to fit the mage's need.\"\n\n\"What are these truths?\"\n\n\"The established facts, laws and principles that govern the way in which the world works.\"\n\n\"How can we determine these established facts, laws and principles?\"\n\n\"In a system without the existence of mana and magic, it is the way the world operates. In this condition, we use the scientific method to determine these facts, laws and principles through deductive or inductive reasoning.\"\n\n\"Wonderful! A spell is analogous to a lie. A lie told to the world with the use of mana and the will of a mage, which artificially modifies these established facts, laws and principles. By extending this analogy, the closer the lie is to the truth, the less mana and exertion of a mage's will is required to uphold it,\" Markus concluded.\n\nThe duo was currently in an artificial clearing in the woods far away from the orphanage, neighbouring the stream. It was an area designated by Guy, who wanted to create a region where his mage students could practice their magic without damaging the uninitiated populace residing in the village and the orphanage.\n\n\"The process of modular spellmaking pushes this methodology to its limits by breaking down the 'lies' into self-contained modules, or phrases, that can be chained sequentially or parallelly to formulate a more concise sentence. Through this, we essentially reduce the unnecessary flourishes that go into sustaining the 'lie' thus reducing the mana consumption AND the stress on the mage's will. This is why you and I were able to cast more advanced spells at a lower realm,\" Markus continued. \"The spell can be further optimised by replacing the mana transmutation steps with physical 'fuel'. Such as using physical carbon for |Fireball| instead of transmuting internal mana to carbon, or redirecting atmospheric water vapour for an |Ice Lance| instead of transmuting internal mana to water.\"\n\nMarkus paused before declaring, \"While spellmaking is optimised through modularisation, it is possible to optimise spellcasting through compartmentalisation.\"\n\nHe wore a proud expression and said, \"This was a strategy I developed through experimentation, which was further advanced with the assistance of Master and Teacher Jeeves.\"\n\nJean looked at Markus with sparkling eyes, 'I knew that Senior Brother was awesome!'\n\n#Tsk! What a show-off!#\n\n*It isn't showing off if he is capable.*\n\n#Whatever...#\n\nMarkus waved his jacket aside to reveal a leatherbound book with a metallic frame and a blue mana gem embedded at its centre. Jean's eyes sharpened as she immediately recollected its appearance from the recording. In fact, it hadn't changed at all or showed any signs of wearing. Clearly, it had been well taken care of.\n\nThe grimoire was hanging by a looping chain, perfectly secured, which Markus unlocked with a key hidden in his handsfree belt satchel which he carried with him at all times. Jean only recently found out that her Senior Brother carried a myriad of basic ingredients that he referred to as 'fuels' for his spells. She wondered why he did so ALL THE TIME, to which he would say, \"A mage must always be prepared!\"\n\nAs soon as the grimoire was separated from the chain, the blue gems lit up, activating the first set of enchantments that allowed it to hover before Markus. Markus internally called out to his section of interest, causing the pages to flip rapidly. Once it stopped, Markus glanced at the page and nudged it gently towards Jean.\n\nThe grimoire hovered at a level and arrived in front of Jean. \"That right over there is a compartmentalised version of the modularised |Fireball| spell.\"\n\n\"This seems... complicated. Why are there two spell circles?\" Jean asked while analysing the familiar, yet unfamiliar, spell circles on the page.\n\n\"I will show you what it means soon. But first, can you tell me if anything stands out?\" Markus asked.\n\nJean squinted slightly and spoke in a steady stream of consciousness, \"Based on my understanding, the spell circle on the right is the most similar to the |Fireball| spell, considering that it has the pertinent Source Components for the carbon fuel and oxygen. But then... Wait a minute!\" Jean hummed quietly and drilled down on the spell circle on the left with increased aggression.\n\n\"This... seems to contain the targeting and projection components. But it's unstable, right?\" She spoke out loud.\n\n\"Technically it should be. But here's the interesting bit,\" Markus commented as he gestured for her to look towards him.\n\n\"This right over here is the spell circle for the regular |Fireball| you and I know.\" As he said this, a familiar purple ethereal projection materialised starting from the base of the wand held in Markus' right hand, where the mana gem was attached. He activated it slowly, causing it to propagate along the length of the wand.\n\n\"Now, you may notice that I am relying on a transmutation Source Component here, instead of using a physical Source Component,\" Markus pointed out.\n\nHe then finalised the spell by directing his mana into the circle, causing a ball of fire the size of an apple to form in at the wand's tip, and then ejected it with a short flick. The ball hurtled at a breakneck speed and collided against a protruding rock outcrop near the bank of the stream. It exploded unimpressively, leaving a black sooty mark on the rock.\n\n\"But now, I'm going to apply the compartmentalised version of the spell. So keep a close eye!\"\n\nMarkus initiated the new spell. This time, two different, spell circles materialised. One originating from his shoulder, while the other originated from the large, now illuminated, white mana gem at the base of the wand. The circle from his shoulder descended towards his hand at a faster rate, while the one from the base of the wand moved much slower.\n\n\"You would expect for these two seemingly incomplete circles to collapse, but-\" right then, the two circles collided against each other and like two jigsaw pieces meshing together, they formed a complete diagram that assumed a magnificent purple hue signifying a stable activation. \"-they come together to form the |Fireball| spell!\"\n\nThe circle once again followed the earlier sequence of rotation, formation of a ball of fire, and projection, ending with the ball colliding at the same location on the rock outcrop.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" He asked Jean, to which she nodded vehemently with an unusually serious expression.\n\nMarkus revealed a faint smile and said, \"Master told me to only teach you how to form the standard spells using the wand. As projectile spells are usually beyond the Middle stage of Mana Condensation realm, you will notice that with the wand this becomes possible. BUT, I don't want you to take my word for it. First, try to form the |Fireball| spell circle without the aid of the wand.\"\n\nJean nodded affirmatively and followed the standard steps to activate a spell circle. She materialised the circle's geometry in her mind and exercised her will to form the spell circle on her right palm. The purple construct start to develop slowly and finally assumed the targeted circle. Jean then moved on to the next step: activation. However, right as she channelled her mana into the circle, it wobbled and flicked unstably, before collapsing.\n\n\"As expected,\" Markus said lightly. \"Now, I want you to do the same, except with your wand. A point you must remember: when forming the circle, you need to sense out the mana gem in the wand. Project the spell circle formed through your will onto the mana gem, and let it handle the rest.\"\n\nJean followed Markus' instructions and produced her wand. She followed the earlier steps, except she now transmitted her intended mana circle onto the mana gem with resonated within her senses. Slowly, the spell circle materialised from the mana gem and propagated towards the tip of the wand. Once in position, Jean channelled her mana towards the circle, which surprisingly didn't collapse like last time and followed the same visual sequence of an activated and successful spell.\n\n\"Notice here that you are using a transmutation Source Component as well. However, it isn't failing!\" Markus accented, which surprised Jean further. Usually, at this stage, she would have to rely on a carbon substitute for ignition. But this time, without a problem, a ball of fire formed at the tip of her wand which she then flicked like Markus towards the rock outcrop.\n\nThe ball hurtled in a flat parabolic path before falling a short distance in front of the outcrop and fizzled out with a light pop.\n\n\"Well, at this stage I think you should still rely on a physical Source Component. There was insufficient burning fuel and oxygen concentration to sustain the fire,\" Markus said with a wry smile. \"We aren't finished yet though! Although Master plans to cover the compartmentalised spellcasting at a later stage, I want to show you the added benefits of the wand to help you understand the value of the tool in your hand.\"\n\nMarkus excitedly approached Jean and started to explain the nuances of the compartmentalised process with increased vigour.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-124]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":95,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 122 - Moving On","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"I've been meaning to ask, it's about Jean,\" Guy asked Goran.\n\n\"Is it about her... demeanour? I apologise on her behalf, Teacher Larks,\" Goran immediately proclaimed his remorse without hesitation.\n\n\"Why are you apologising?\"\n\n\"I'm mostly at fault for why she is like this,\" Goran said, drooping his head in dejection.\n\nGuy could feel the weight in Goran's voice, so he immediately led him into his room and shut the door.\n\n\"Take a seat please,\" Guy said casually. Of course, there weren't any \"seats\" available in his room. But Goran understood nonetheless and presumed a seated position next to the low table at the centre, right in front of Guy's folded sleeping mattress. Guy followed Goran and sat opposite him.\n\n\"If you don't mind, I would like to hear the full story,\" Guy enunciated in a calm and low tone.\n\nGoran wore a stiff expression, as he pondered over how to begin. It wasn't that he was unwilling to reveal his daughter's condition or his past. After all, Teacher Larks WAS her daughter's sole instructor. He literally held her future in his hands, and it would be inadvisable to not be forthright with the man, lest it results in some unwanted consequences down the line.\n\n\"My wife died when Jean was five years old,\" Goran started. \"She died in front of her. And it wasn't a pleasant sight, Teacher Larks- No! Far from it!\"\n\nGoran pulled back his outburst of emotions and said, \"She was just a little girl back then - Jean. It really affected her...\"\n\n\"Would you please elaborate?\"\n\n\"I don't know what it was, but her emotions just went haywire. One minute she would be fine, but the next she would devolve into a destructive spiral. She was a danger to herself and the people around her. Cursing, flailing, flinging items, breaking things, banging her head against the wall, crying...\" as Goran kept on listing Jean's past behaviours, his face started to contort in distress. \"The first time a nanny tried to stop her, she bit down on her hand. Ever since then, it was either myself or Josie who would tend to her when she entered such a state.\"\n\n\"Can you explain how she would get triggered?\"\n\n\"I didn't know it back then. I always thought that her fragile psyche had truly perished and turned her mad. It was this misplaced assumption of mine that led me to proceed with the treatment that left her like this - an emotionless shell,\" Goran skirted the question with a self-blaming tirade. \"I should have taken the time to hear her out. If only I had done that, instead of listening to others...\"\n\n\"What was it that triggered her?\" Guy asked again with a little force in his voice.\n\n\"It was herself! She blamed herself for Nyla's death. I don't know what gave her that idea? Both Nyla and I kept telling her that her mother's occupation was one fraught with peril...\" Goran answered.\n\n\"Why would she blame herself?\"\n\n\"Apparently, Nyla got caught up in trying to isolate Jean which resulted in her getting contaminated with the plague instead.\"\n\nGuy hummed in contemplation before asking, \"Do YOU blame Jean for your wife's death?\"\n\n\"I-\" Goran wanted to say \"don't\" but something stopped him from vocalising it.\n\n\"Do I blame her?\" he muttered out loud.\n\n\"Do you blame yourself, then?\" Guy followed.\n\n\"Maybe... I don't know. Well, I don't blame Jean... No, I don't...\" Goran kept repeating in a trance.\n\n\"Why does it have to be anyone's fault?\" Guy probed. \"If anything, it was your wife's fault.\"\n\nRight as those words left Guy's lips, the pressure in the room rose exponentially. It originated from Goran whose face was red with boundless rage. Before the pressure could reach levels unbearable for Guy, he quickly added, \"If she knew that the place was so perilous, why did she take Jean with her anyways?\"\n\n\"That-\" Goran didn't have an answer to that. Now that he thought about it, the question was reasonably founded.\n\n\"I refuse to believe that a mage who was as strong as she was-\" Guy paused to see if Goran agreed with that statement, noticing that he did Guy continued, \"-would not be aware that a little girl was following her, or sneaking around her.\"\n\n\"It was arrogance!\" Guy declared. \"Arrogance, that led to negligence, that led to her own death. Please correct me if I'm wrong!\"\n\n\"No,\" Goran said meekly. \"It does sound like her...\"\n\nGuy exhaled a long breath to calm his growing anger. He didn't need further explanation to realise just what had happened to Jean to leave her in such an unaffected state. She had been chemically lobotomised, or the magical equivalent of it, just because the professionals treating her didn't realise that the girl was going through bipolar episodes. It was absolutely deplorable!\n\n\"She would have been fine - Jean. All she needed was a little patience, and someone to talk to and explain to her that she wasn't the one to be blamed,\" Guy said in a tranquil tone that masked his inner turmoil. \"However, there is no point in dwelling over it. What's done is done. Although I can't guarantee that I can cure her, I will do everything within my power to assist her.\"\n\n\"S-Should she stop taking her medicinal potions?\" Goran asked apprehensively. He could feel the temper fuming within Guy.\n\n\"She isn't taking them anymore. Marie has been observing her for the past few weeks.\"\n\n\"Then her sleep?\"\n\n\"It's been better. She used to wake up all sweating and shaken. But nowadays, she's become much calmer. She even slept in a few days back,\" Guy answered, and received a relieved sigh from Goran.\n\nTheir conversation entered an awkward pause at that point. Goran's face had dropped markedly, as he stared into the ground with a blank gaze. Guy spent the time trying to suppress his ire. He knew that he couldn't blame the father for his mishandling of a manageable mental illness. After all, it wasn't ill-intentioned - Goran just didn't know any better. But as a teacher from a modern world, nothing irked Guy more than when someone treated kids with mental illnesses poorly because they misunderstood them as \"mad\" or \"weird\". It was a common occurrence in the villages and rural places Guy used to visit and teach in, and it was something he actively combated in his past life.\n\nAfter Guy centred his emotions he noticed Goran's checked-out expression. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh? Nothing really. I was just going through my memories about my wife. Now that you pointed it out, there were many times she had let her arrogance get the better of her,\" Goran said while chuckling. \"But I kind of liked that about her, if I'm being honest. It was cute. She would be so confident at times, so sure that she would succeed, only to fail miserably and would return with her head hung low and a sheepish apology on her lips.\"\n\nGuy furrowed his brows slightly as he noticed the emptiness in Goran's eyes. Through his experiences in his previous life, Guy had lost a lot of trust in adults. He'd seen children suffer unimaginable tragedies solely because of the, knowingly or unknowingly, ill-advised actions of adults. Take Jean's current state for instance. It was the outcome of the mistakes of her mother and her father. No matter how well-meaning their actions were, it had inevitably affected the poor girl drastically.\n\nBut now, as he heard Goran reminisce about his wife, Guy realised that the man before him was also suffering. Being an adult doesn't absolve someone from heartache. Sometimes, it hurts them even more.\n\n\"Tell me about her - Jean's mother, I mean,\" Guy inquired.\n\nGoran revealed a faint smile and started, \"She was different. Our first encounter was completely coincidental. She had erroneously confronted an Abyssal Dragon in search of some herb and ended up nearly dying to its attack. If I hadn't stumbled upon her with my comrades, she would have perished then and there. She truly was an arrogant one - I sort of realised it back then - but she was also quick to admit her mistakes, which was unique for someone like that. She learned and improved after every mistake, except for curbing her hot-headedness of course.\"\n\nGoran laughed out loud and said, \"She could never sit still. There was always something new. A new adventure, a discovery, some new research. But what I liked most about her was her selflessness. Everything she did was for the benefit of someone else. She once said that the only selfish thing she ever did her entire life was pursuing me. And boy oh boy was it a whirlwind of a pursuit. Everywhere I turned, she was there. She would be there when I woke up, and she would wish me good night as I went to bed. I didn't dislike her; the more I got to know her, the deeper I fell for her.\"\n\n\"They say that love is the death of a mage. It never made sense to me back then. But now that I've lost Nyla, I can understand what it meant. We expunge love from our hearts because if we do succumb to it, and lose that beloved entity, our entire life becomes nothing more than a slow crawl towards death. And since we mages live for what can sometimes be perceived as an eternity... It becomes a literal living hell!\" Goran admitted.\n\n\"How long have you been married?\" Guy probed.\n\n\"Exactly 49 years,\" Goran answered. \"Just one short of 50.\"\n\n\"You had Jean really late then, huh?\"\n\n\"It was a conscious decision. I didn't want to have a child at first.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"I guess it was my own poor experience with my father.\"\n\n\"Let's talk about that,\" Guy urged.\n\n\"Well... I don't have much attachment to my father. Although the men are allowed to have multiple concubines in an official capacity, he never adhered to that option. Instead, while my mother was still pregnant with me, he was having multiple affairs with women, unofficially. To him, it was all about the taboo nature. He could have just as easily brought his many flings in as concubines, but he never did that! By the time I was born, he had made two other women pregnant, and then they were forced to become his concubines, to save the clan's face. He never held much affection for his wards except for one, and that was only because of the woman who birthed him. That vixen knew exactly what to say to entice my father and grab his attention.\n\nSo I think it was my idea of familial love that dissuaded me at first. I believed that because of my father, my understanding of it wasn't right. That is also why I swore that I would only marry one person in my entire life. Thankfully, I found Nyla. \n\nI never had the support or love from my father, and I worried that if I had a child of my own, I wouldn't be able to raise it properly. Nyla understood that, and she was fine with taking her time. But after a point, I got this feeling that something was missing in our lives. After some thought, I realised that the remaining hollowness I was feeling, this emptiness, was the conflict resulting from my fear of having a child and a faint hope of becoming a father. So I decided to take the bold next step, and we had Jean. She was the product of our love and now she's all that I have left.\" \n\nGoran snorted in self-deprecation and said, \"It's funny, you know? I've ever always had only one source of happiness at a time. I guess it's a curse of mine...\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Well... When I was born, I had my mother. But then she passed away. Then I had Nyla, and then she left as well. Now Jean... I can't lose her, Teacher Larks! I admit that I made a huge mistake, but you must understand, it was the only thing I felt I could do!\"\n\n\"That's the thing, isn't it. Life isn't always in our control. One moment, you're living a healthy and happy life, the next you're confined to a bed suffering from a myriad of illnesses,\" Guy quickly interjected.\n\n\"I don't understand?\" Goran evoked in defeat.\n\n\"First off, Nyla is gone, Mister Rasmus. You must learn to let her go and focus on what you have right now. Second, you realised the errors you have committed with Jean, so now you need to now work towards doing right by her. If you keep putting your wife on a pedestal as such and lamenting over her passing, you will never move forward. Commemorate your wife's life as it should be, but move on because I am sure that is what she would have liked for you to do as well,\" Guy expounded. \"On top of that, it is your preoccupation with the self-perceived fact that you are alone that is hurting you. You need to realise that there are people around you that care for you. Take Teacher Jeeves for instance, I don't believe that your friendship with him is only in passing?\"\n\n\"... You're right...\" Goran uttered.\n\n\"So I know that it may sound callous of me, but I believe that it is time for you to take steps to move on. If not for yourself, then at least for Jean. And if you are struggling, please don't hesitate to reach out to people around you - such as myself for instance,\" Guy offered.\n\n____\n\nTeacher Larks' advice rang in Goran's head. He reached forward, lifted the portrait, and called out for assistance, \"You there!\"\n\n\"You called, Master?\" An attendant outside the room quickly walked in with his head lowered.\n\n\"I want you to hang this up over there, on the wall behind the bed. Oh! And move in all the previous decorations and furniture on that side of the room from my study and my bedroom,\" Goran instructed. \"I will be sleeping here from now on.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-123]]","n":0.021}}},{"i":96,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 121 - Hidden Behind a Bookshelf","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n\"Mister Goran?\" Kano said in a low voice while tugging at Goran's jacket.\n\n\"Huh? Ah! Kano!\" Goran exclaimed as he was pulled out of his wistful trance.\n\n\"Was she Medium Sis' Mother?\" Kano inquired.\n\n\"Medium Sis?\"\n\nKano chuckled lightly and clarified, \"That's what everyone calls Sister Jean.\"\n\nThe explanation and Kano's cheeky expression brought some mirth into Goran's drooping facade. He exhaled loudly and answered, \"You're right. This is Nyla, she was Jean's mother and my wife.\"\n\n\"She looked beautiful,\" Kano admitted wholeheartedly.\n\n\"She WAS beautiful. Inside and out,\" Goran's voice wavered as he spoke. He extended his hand towards the painting and caressed the woman's face with shaking fingers.\n\n\"She was so beautiful...\"\n\n\"Who painted this portrait?\" Kano interrupted as he noticed Goran descending into a depressing spiral.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you painted?!\" Kano vocalised in incredulity.\n\n\"I used to. Not anymore though...\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Kano retorted. Only to receive an elongated silence from Goran. Kano realised that he had possibly struck another chord and decided to shift the conversation.\n\n\"I can feel a lot of love and affection emanating from the painting. The brushstrokes are meticulous and meaningful. The use of colour evokes a vibrancy that closely mimicks her character-\"\n\nGoran interrupted Kano with a raised eyebrow, \"How do you know her character?\"\n\nKano scratched his chin to copy a gesture he had seen Teacher Larks perform many times when he entered deep contemplation.\n\n\"The books,\" the boy stated. \"They sort of match up.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well. The portrait tells me a lot about what kind of person she is, or at least what kind of person you perceive her as. Which I think is quite close to her actual character seeing as you two have been married for quite a while now. So when I read those journals, I found the author's tone overlapping with the person in the portrait,\" Kano explained.\n\n\"You are very perceptive!\" Goran praised while gently patting Kano's back in appreciation.\n\nHe then looked around the room and released a sigh filled with years of repressed emotion.\n\n\"Was I not supposed to come in here?\" Kano asked with an apologetic gaze.\n\nGoran pulled his lips into a thin line and shook his head lightly.\n\n\"This used to be our room, Nyla and I. Our little world. She was the one who decided to decorate the room this way, half for me and half for her. I've moved most of my things out of here, but I just couldn't touch hers,\" Goran nudged his chin in the direction of the bookshelf as he said this.\n\n\"By the way, how did you gain entry into this room? I believe it was supposed to be locked,\" Goran inquired.\n\n\"I don't know. The door just swung open,\" Kano answered as he scratched his head.\n\n\"I have the help come in and clean the room once every week, I guess they forgot to lock it up this time,\" Goran muttered.\n\n\"There sure are a lot of books!\" Kano exclaimed as he once again approached the massive bookshelf.\n\n\"Oh, this? You're barely scratching the surface, boy,\" Goran said lightly with a hint of playfulness, as he walked up to the right edge of the bookshelf. He then reached forward and placed his hands on a raised marble slab. Kano observed as Goran's hand started to light up, and a purple ethereal circle extended outwards and began rotating clockwise. Suddenly, the ground started to shake as the bookshelf swung inwards from the centre.\n\nKano took a step back and absorbed the phenomenon in its entirety. The motion finally stopped after half a minute, following which a passageway lit up automatically and revealed rows upon rows of similar bookshelves each stocked to the brim with the same type of journal.\n\n\"Wow! There're more?!\" Kano exclaimed excitedly.\n\n\"My Nyla loved to journal everything. From her meticulous theories to inane happenings,\" Goran explained as he walked into the passageway.\n\n\"This space is under a magnification enchantment - actually multiple magnification enchantments. We've had to add more of them each time Nyla ran out of space,\" Goran continued with a warm, nostalgic tone as he pointed at the black gems embedded into the ceiling of the passageway. Kano noticed the intricate, illuminated carvings that snaked out with alluring geometries.\n\n\"It got so difficult near the end. Because each time we had to extend the size, we had to remove all the books, remove the existing enchantments, then redraw the new enchantments, and THEN move the books all in. You must know that the original space is substantially smaller than what you see right now, so the enchanters had a really tough time drawing those carvings for the more recent additions. It definitely cost us a fortune too!\"\n\nGoran wore a conflicted expression before adding, \"It WAS my idea though. Nyla wanted to store these journals at the mansion's library, but I felt that they were far too personal to be mixed in with the generic books.\"\n\nHe then furrowed his brows and continued, \"Nyla wanted to preserve these for Jean, ever since she showed interest in becoming a healer. The day little Jean made that firm but cute declaration for becoming the 'best healer in the world', Nyla descended into her journal-writing with rekindled vigour. It was hilarious and deeply concerning as she sometimes went days on end holed up in the study, jotting down vague memories and anecdotes from her past, as well as inane theories that warranted further study which Jean might find interesting. A lot of the books on display outside were written by her during the years after Jean's birth\"\n\n\"'We can't always be there for Jeanie. One day, when she is down and out and lost, maybe these journals can guide her,' she would keep repeating. I wonder if she somehow knew...\" Goran muttered.\n\nGoran snapped out of his impending trance and exclaimed, \"That's right! I never showed Jean all of these before, considering her fragile state of mind. But now that she is on her way to becoming a proper mage, she would definitely find these useful.\"\n\nWith that, Goran mentally jotted down a reminder to transfer these books to Jean, either by erecting a library in the village near the orphanage or by investing in a storage disk for her.\n\n\"Am I allowed to read them?\" Kano asked meekly.\n\n\"Huh? Of course, you can. But I hope you remember the event at the guild?\" Goran hinted. He then smiled wryly and added, \"Your painting of the Red Dragon Smaug will probably enter the exhibition as well.\"\n\n\"What?! Why?\" Kano exhibited a more animated reaction this time around. While before he didn't really care when others looked at his works, there was a sense of apprehension in his attitude now.\n\n\"It's my fault,\" Goran admitted. \"I inadvertently drew you into a familiar conflict. But don't worry, I will make sure that you aren't affected adversely,\" He promised.\n\n\"BUT, I think that entering your first work will prove to be a boon for you. You will be able to recieve valuable feedback from experts and practitioners. It will be extremely beneficial towards developing your craft. After all, living in an echo chamber will only reinforce negative and detrimental habits.\"\n\nKano pondered on it for a while before nodding in affirmation, albeit with a hit of nervousness. Goran smiled at the boy's blatant expressions.\n\n'It's good that his behaviour has changed this way.' To Goran, this showed that the boy was learning more AND was recognising his inexperience. Although he didn't want to crush Kano's enthusiasm, this was a necessary step for every practitioner to a craft because without it one couldeasily grow arrogant.\n\n\"I'll leave you to it then,\" Goran added before turning to leave. \"Once you are done, inform the attendant outside. They will close the bookshelf.\"\n\n____\n\nOnce Goran exited the walk-in bookshelf, he turned to face the portrait once again. He stared at Nyla's face for what felt to him like an eternity.\n\nIt wasn't a secret that Goran was an avid collector and appreciator of paintings and artworks. But it was a less-known fact that Goran himself was a talented painter, specifically a portrait artist. It was less-known because he never applied for a license with the guild and he only painted for a singular client: his wife. It was through Nyla's encouragement that Goran picked up a brush and deigned to walk down the artist's path. He quickly found out that he had some talent in it and quickly began to practice his craft by drawing portraits and stills of people he'd meet and come across in his daily life.\n\nOf course, he would never show them to the public, only his wife. She was his critic and his sole customer. Sometimes, when they had nothing to do, they would retire to his private studio and look through his paintings. They would select a few and knit together an elaborate story about the person in the image, their background, their aspirations, what they were doing at that time in particular. It was their pass-time.\n\nAnd the painting before him was the last one Goran ever painted. He felt that he had improved enough, by practising with portraits of other people, to be able to perfectly capture his wife eternally on a blank piece of canvas. And he did succeed in doing so! Goran had reached deep into his heart, metaphorically dislodged a large chunk of it, and distilled it into the painting. Although his wife had perished, her spirit persisted within this portrait. It was exactly because of this that Goran had it covered and locked up in their old room.\n\nGoran feared that as long as this portrait remained, he would never truly get over the loss of his beloved. Every time he gazed at her face, all the now painful memories would gush out from behind a locked chamber in his heart that he had forcefully barricaded. Goran feared that as long as this painting remained, he would one day end himself to join her in death.\n\nGoran couldn't let that happen! He had to protect Jean. But he couldn't bring himself to destroy the portrait! He managed to burn the others, without remorse. Yet this one was special.\n\n\"Maybe my method was wrong, to begin with,\" Goran uttered. He recollected a conversation he had with Teacher Larks before he departed from the village.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-122]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":97,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 120 - (Mis)Adventures of a Healer","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n\"Of all the possible procedures that a healer can perform in their career, none are riskier than childbirth. Even with mages, childbirth is one of the most taxing and life-threatening phases of their lives, it isn't farfetched to declare that the waning population amongst the ancient clans is a result of this fear,\" Kano read out loud. Although some of the words written on the page were beyond his reading level, he had enough experience in applying phonetics to pronounce them properly. Even though he hadn't seen or heard of some of the words and terms used, he could understand their implication through contextual clues.\n\n\"Why is this the case? Why is childbirth so risky, even for mages who are supposed to be considered stronger, better, superior in every way possible? I found through highly targeted research, after perusing texts from acknowledged sources over multiple kingdoms, that the healing community is divided into two contrasting corners. The first, and the most controversial, opinion suggests that childbirth is akin to a tribulation every mortal and mage must go through. Those that perish during it, do so because they are unworthy. If that were the case, then why is it that men do not have to undergo this so-called \"tribulation\"? Needless to say that I do not agree with this opinion. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of healers subscribing to this theory happen to be males...\"\n\n\"The second opinion suggests that childbearing itself is a taxing process as the unborn child siphons half of all the nutrition absorbed by the mother. Supporting research performed by a healer who observed the childbearing phase amongst mothers from different species and from different realms of magic concluded that the absorption is proportional to the realm of the mother, i.e. the stronger the mother the greater the nutrition is absorbed by the child. Essentially, the child can be analogous to a parasite that tunes its hunger based on the capacity of its host (I find this analogy abhorrent yet apt)(on a side note, it was also found that a child born from a mage at a higher cultivation realm will generally have an easier time advancing as a mage). Hence, if a prospective mother does not moderate her intake according to her capacity, then she faces greater danger during childbirth since her life force may not be sufficient to sustain her through the process. This of course ignores other complications such as the baby's size, orientation, and other such complications that can also adversely affect the mother and in some cases the child.\"\n\n\"However, it is callous to simply make such a declaration and expect a different outcome, because we are overlooking the inherent inequality faced by people from different walks of life. It is unfair to instruct a village woman, who barely makes enough to feed herself, to eat more. Interestingly, the research conducted by the earlier healer did suggest that a mortal woman fares better during childbirth even if her nutrient consumption is below the safe amount (on the other hand, a mage is guaranteed to perish if they do not meet that benchmark).\"\n\n\"Thus I wonder if it is possible to overcome this obstacle by developing a novel birthing procedure that can increase the probability of safe childbirth. The closest solution I have found seems to be derived from a common, yet admittedly barbaric, strategy employed in rural villages. If childbirth enters a dire situation, and the life of the mother and child hangs on a balance, it is often the case that the family sides with the child over the mother. Inevitably, the midwife or person handling the childbirth simply extracts the baby right from the mother's womb by creating an incision (of course, the mother dies a painful death due to blood loss).\"\n\nKano visibly cringed at the last sentence. His tiny mind just couldn't fathom what he was reading at this point. Everything was just so unbelievably gory.\n\n\"It is possible to use healing arts to stifle bleeding. However, the pain is still an issue that needs to be acknowledged. A simple numbing balm is insufficient. The most optimal solution is to ingest a potion that directly inhibits the nerves that register the pain. Essentially, a potion that targets the spine in any way should work. I have yet to properly test this theory. You can already imagine the difficulty... I abhor having to seek out pregnant women and test out half-baked theories on them with the hope of perfecting my procedure. Furthermore, very few women consent to it - only those desperate volunteer. Nonetheless, this will be my Magnum Opus! I hope that when I have my child, she will have the benefit of being born through my procedure. Of course, this is all wishful thinking.\"\n\nWhat followed after were some incredibly in-depth sketches and descriptions that elaborated on various theories and solutions thought up by the woman. Kano did not understand any of them, so he carefully closed the book and placed it to the side. Having piqued his interest, Kano decided to check out the rest of the books on the shelves.\n\nHe went over to the first one from the left and picked it out. To reach it he had to drag over a chair from the other side of the room and had to stand on his tip-toes. He carefully placed the book on his lap and opened it to the first page.\n\n\"This is also a journal!\" And it was also written in the same impeccable and legible handwriting as the one before, albeit Kano could feel more energy and vigour from this one given the passionate flourishes and forceful penmanship.\n\nThe first page read, \"Documenting Medicinal Fungi from the Swamps of Garand.\"\n\n\"Why did I have to be so hardheaded and stubborn? As part of my advancement ceremony within Saint Mungo's Order, my sect dedicated to the healing arts, I have chosen to explore the treacherous Swamps of Garand. Honestly, though, it wasn't as if the other options were any better. The Misty-Maze Valley and the Endless Lake of Mar are just as dangerous, the only difference is that a multitude of hitherto unknown poisonous plants and venomous fauna were indigenous to the swamps. Well, wasn't this the whole purpose of the advancement task? Documenting new and unknown things? Expanding the Order's archives to improve our capacity as healers? Who am I kidding? If it weren't for Kaisel's idiotic challenge and diminutive words, I would have chosen between the other two like the rest of my batch. I should have just swallowed my pride and followed the crowd. Note to self: Never let your pride overtake reason!\"\n\nKano raised his eyebrows in surprise and commented, \"Huh... That's exactly what Teacher Larks says.\"\n\nHe then continued, \"Boy o boy was I lucky! I nearly got stung by a Nerubian Mosquito! If it weren't for my inner-wear with an active insect-repelling enchantment, I would have died minutes into my exploration. But in the process of escaping a horde of those fatal bloodsuckers, I stumbled upon a fungal cluster that has not been recorded within the Order's archives. Interestingly, these fungi passively deter Nerubian Mosquitoes. I think a further investigation into the properties of this particular fungi is warranted.\"\n\n\"Interesting... By sheer fortune, I stumbled upon the only herbivorous fauna that lives in the Swamps of Garand - I call it the Skinchanging Sloth. A rather sluggish creature, this sloth moves at an unbearably slow pace and has near-negligible mana and life signature (matching that of a corpse) - I would have missed it had I not been ardently observing the fungi clusters. It seems as though it is this characteristic that has allowed it to survive in such an antagonistic environment. Furthermore, the sloth seems to exclusively consume the myriad of fungi growing around the area it resides in. I've named this species of the sloth Skinchanging for a specific reason, and that is because it physically alters its skin to exude the same essence as the fungi it consumes. This phenomenon naturally deters the multitude of insects that linger in its vicinity. I am using the sloth to gauge the edible nature of these fungi.\"\n\n\"Success! One of the fungi frequently consumed by the Skinchaning Sloth promotes coagulation of the blood. That is, if the blood is exposed to the atmospheric air, it coagulates at a rapid rate (at least 3 times the average). Furthermore, the aroma it exudes acts as an excellent insect-repellent (on a side note: it smells suspiciously of strawberries)!\"\n\nKano continued reading the enthusiastically written journal to its completion. He was so absorbed in it that he didn't see or hear a person entering the room. By the time he finished and returned it carefully to his now growing \"already read\" pile, he was surprised by the sudden presence of Goran within the room.\n\nThe boy was about to open his mouth to apologise, but he suddenly noticed the dreary aura hanging over the man. If there was one thing Kano was good at, it was picking up on emotional cues - and it was uncannily accurate. He never knew he even had such an ability, but when all other troubles lingering in his mind were slowly dislodged by Teacher Larks, all of his suppressed qualities just burst through.\n\nAs Kano approached Goran, he noticed just what had gotten the man into such a morose frame of mind: it was the painting of the woman.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-121]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":98,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 119 - The Room","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nA/N: Mister is used as a more informal/close form of address. Formally, Goran would be called Clan Leader Rasmus.\n\n____\n\nThe books, once consumed by Goran, inevitably made their way into Kano's hands and were received with much excitement. Although Kano preferred reading works of fiction, he was especially enamoured by the prospect of reading educational texts exploring different art styles, with hopes of broadening his capacity and expanding his toolbox. After all, this was the primary reason why Kano ventured out of the village with Mister Rasmus.\n\nSpeaking of which, Kano was incredibly nervous the first time he entered Radiant City. Everything was just so... big! There were people everywhere - if someone were to toss a pin into the air, it would never reach the ground. It was that crowded! There were a myriad of noises reverberating, calling for Kano's attention. A plethora of bright lights, colourful signs, and enrapturing sights filled with magic assaulted his senses. Surprisingly, the throng of folks kept their distance from the carriage he was in. It was only later that Kano realised the cause - the seal that was plastered on the side of the carriage, denoting the Rasmus Clan.\n\nTeacher Larks wasn't speaking lightly when he warned Kano about the significance of Mister Rasmus' background. The Rasmus Clan was a powerhouse others couldn't look at lightly. The only power that superseded them within this region was probably the Maika Clan, who were responsible for this Duchy. Of course, above them stood the Emperor's clan, but that was a bit beyond Kano's comprehension.\n\nKano worldview was akin to a country bumpkin. After being exposed to a small glimpse of the outside world, Kano realised just how small he was in the grand scheme of things. The Rasmus Clan's mansion in the city definitely did not help towards alleviating this. Kano couldn't wrap his mind around how a house could be so big. It was like a small village in and of itself! The guest room Kano was staying in was at least ten times larger than the room he shared with his sister. Oh and the bed! So soft! Kano drowned himself inside its warm and cosy embrace and achieved a slumber so deep that he dozed through the entire day. \n\nTo that end, Mister Rasmus had assigned a tutor to instruct Kano about certain nuances he needed to be wary about. They weren't exhaustive, just basic etiquette and general knowledge so that he wouldn't be lost during social interactions. After all, he was supposed to show his face in public along with the Rasmus Clan's leader, he couldn't portray himself as a common rube.\n\nEvery morning, the tutor assigned to him would arrive right on the dot at seven. After that, Kano was free to do whatever he pleased. He was allowed to roam around the mansion, talk to everyone working there, eat whatever he wanted, and paint and draw to his heart's desires. Kano was living a carefree life.\n\nThe day before, Kano received the stack of textbooks compiled by Teacher Larks. At first glance, they looked unbearably exhausting, but after taking his time and reading through them, Kano was completely addicted. The discussions and examples shown in the books were enlightening, to say the least. They offered Kano a wider perspective on how to approach art. They introduced new techniques that Kano was kind of familiar with, from when he was learning about literature.\n\nFor instance, one section of a book discussed the power of symbolism in art. It said that one can manipulate colour, form, imagery and composition to emphasise personal or absolute truths and perspectives in visual form. When writing, symbols are often portrayed as specific objects or motifs that repeat themselves and hold a specific meaning to them. Of course, the specific application or inclusion of the symbol can alter its significance. For instance, the colour red symbolises maturity. A red dress can allude to sensuality or allure, or it can portray bloodlust and rage. The red ruby shoes worn by Dorothy from Wizard of Oz symbolise the growth and maturing of the character through her journey.\n\nKano realised that it was possible to extend this into the visual arts realm. By skewing realism and naturalism, one can extend what can be perceived from artwork from just the surface imagery. Of course, to achieve this, the observer must also be able to look beyond just what is shown. Kano understood that this may be an issue for the time being. Within the mansion, there was a room that was filled with artworks, as well as recording artefacts containing images and recordings of the more expensive and higher-tiered arts that were stored in a more secure space. Upon studying them, Kano realised that current standards of art relied heavily on recreating scenes, landscapes or portraits with high levels of realism. The closer the work came to reality the more it was lauded.\n\nKano lowered the book in his hand, carefully closed it and placed it on the study desk in the guest room. Although he had only spent a little more than a week in this mansion, Kano's body had undergone drastic changes. For one, he was no longer a scrawny, depressing kid. His cheeks had gained some fat that brought more life into his already blinding smile. His unkempt curly brown hair was tied into a neat bun, just like the one worn by Mister Rasmus.\n\nWith a light leap, Kano landed on the floor and put on his wooden slippers. He walked out of the room and clip-clopped happily towards the art storage room, to gape at the works once again. This time, he wanted to observe the works with a broader lens, to see if the artists had somehow instilled any symbols, themes or other such stylistic devices that had gone unnoticed.\n\nThe mansion was largely open-air, with an exposed central courtyard holding a beautiful mini-garden. The prefix mini- is used lightly since it was the same size as Matron Reva's garden! On top of that, there was a veritable meadow surrounding the mansion which Mister Rasmus called the 'actual' garden. Because of the plants and trees in the courtyard, the ambience was much cooler and breezier. It almost felt as though Kano hadn't left the village.\n\nThe boy navigated through the hallways with familiarity. After all, apart from the guest room, Kano practically lived within the art storage room. \n\nClip-Clop, he skipped, while humming a light tune.\n\nClip-Clop.\n\nClip-Clop.\n\nClip-SNAP! \"Ow!\"\n\nKano's left slipper snapped at the joint between his toes. It did so right when Kano lifted his foot forward, causing it to detach and fling itself along an awkward trajectory. The slipper bounced off the wall and hit a door on the opposite side, right at the handle, causing it to slide open. The boy hopped forward on one leg to retrieve the rogue slipper which had fallen into the open room.\n\nHe picked it up casually without paying much attention to his surroundings. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew in from the courtyard and thrust the lightly open door fully. It didn't stop there, the interloping gust of wind rolled forward and lifted the white clothes covering the various items within the room, exposing them to the environment. After wreaking sufficient havoc, the gust exited through the window within the room, throwing it open and allowing natural light to enter.\n\n\"Woah!\" Kano vocalised as he absorbed the wonderfully designed room. It had elegant marbled walls with golden, jewel-adorned sconces, and wooden beam ceilings evoking a mix of both wealth and rustic simultaneously. Near the centre of the room, there was a half-elevation leading up to an enormous bed. A series of bookshelves were flushed into the wall on one side of the room, lined with a variety of books ranging in age but of uniform design. Kano's eyes sparkled upon witnessing the sight, he had never seen so many different books in his life. As a voracious reader, this was his personal heaven. The other side of the room was comparatively barren. Somehow, Kano got the feeling that it used to be populated with furniture and life but was now devoid of it all leaving only a sad, empty space.\n\nFrom the corner of his eyes, Kano observed what he recognised as a stand where painters hung their completed works for display. Interestingly, it was the only item in the room that had yet to be affected by the rogue wind, as it was still completely covered by a smooth white cloth. With a curious frown, Kano approached it and with a gentle tug, removed the cloth.\n\nAs the cloth fell to the ground, the painting displayed on the stand revealed itself. It was a portrait of a woman. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his entire life. Her eyes were like pearls, with pupils so dark that they could trap light; they were sharp, with a pleasant almond shape. Her nose arched elegantly, ending with a cute and plump tip that evoked a feeling of wanting to squeeze them. Her cheeks were rosy and lively, with dimples in them. She was smiling with her teeth showing - it was a hearty smile, one that forced you to smile along. It filled Kano with infinite warmth. Her hair draped down her side and ended with a mirthful bounce. She looked as though she were running through a field of roses, without a care in the world.\n\nKano could feel an unbearable amount of love oozing out of the painting. The kind of love Kano had never felt before in his entire life. How could someone love another so deeply? Kano's eyes drifted to the bottom right corner of the painting, only to droop in disappointment at not witnessing the artist's signature.\n\n\"Whoever painted this loved this person dearly, whoever she was...\" He mumbled.\n\nKano took a few steps back to observe the painting better. The further he went, the more he felt as though he had seen this woman somewhere before. Right as he took the final step, his back collided against the bookshelf.\n\n\"It's Medium Sis Jean!\" Kano exclaimed. Right as he did so, a wobbling book stumbled out of the shelf and landed squarely on his head.\n\n\"Ouch! What was that?\" As he followed the sound, he noticed a handwritten journal flung open before him on the floor.\n\n\"Investigating a Practically Safe Invasive Procedure for Emergency Birthing,\" Kano enunciated slowly in trying to read the beautifully written texts on the open page.\n\nKano hummed curiously and plopped down to read the rest of the page.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-120]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":99,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 118 - Family Troubles","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nKarmin noted that Goran was entering a deep trance-like, euphoric state as he voraciously read through the books one after the other. Rather than speedily consuming it, which he had the capacity for, Goran was taking his time reading the contents word by word. In order to not disturb the absorbed man, Karmin lightly bade farewell and stood up to leave. Right as he did so, the door opened slowly and the same butler who had directed him to the salon entered.\n\n\"Master, the Third Master Rasmus is here,\" the elderly butler declared, eliciting a disdainful snort from Goran.\n\n\"What does he want?\"\n\n\"I am afraid Third Master Rasmus did not declare his purpose. He stated that he wishes to -\"\n\n\"Does a man need a reason to enter his own house?\" A nasal voice interjected the butler midway. Following that, a wiry looking man, tall in stature yet looking diminished due to a slight hunch, barged through. The man shared a few similarities in facial features with Goran such as the flat hazel-grey eyes, a commonality in the Rasmus clan, and the wavy long ashen hair which was wrapped up in a burn. Apart from that, Karmin found the two individuals in stark contrast to each other. Where Goran was large and well-built, the \"Third Master\" was offensively thin and scrawny. Where Goran's gaze overflowed with warmth and pressure, the \"Third Master's\" was gushing with meek cunning and deceit.\n\nIt was the first time that Karmin felt like punching someone so badly. He didn't know what it was, maybe it was the man's presence itself that irked him so greatly. Yet, Karmin rightfully held himself back. Although the man looked weak, he was nearly as strong as Goran Rasmus. After all, he had only barely lost the fight to assume the position of the clan leader.\n\nLike most other clans in the Empire and beyond, the position of the clan leader, head, or patriarch was often relegated to the strongest of the generation. While Karmin could argue about the feasibility of such brutal methods, it was a tradition that has prevailed for generations. The position of clan leader often spans a single generation, which lasts for about a century give or take a few decades, or following the passing of the clan leader due to \"unfortunate circumstances\". Following that, a contest of capability and strength is held, which differs from clan to clan, that determines the next clan leader from a pool of nominees. If the current clan leader is still alive and healthy, they are absorbed into the pool of clan elders that support the clan from the background. The clan elders act as support structures to guide the clan and advice the leader during times of crisis. Apart from that, the elders do not interfere with clan decisions - unless the clan's interests are threatened - and the decision making power is held solely by the leader.\n\nFor the current generation, the one that reigned over all other nominees in the Rasmus clan was Goran Rasmus. But his victory wasn't so easily attained. After all, he had to contend against his greatest rival, Myron Rasmus, his younger half-brother. Myron's strength wasn't in his martial prowess, nor was it in his superior thinking. No. In both ways, Myron was inferior to Goran. Yet what gave Myron his edge was the ever-lasting love and affection of Goran's father. After all, Myron was born from his father's most \"precious\" of concubines.\n\nEven though he was younger, Myron cast a massive shadow over Goran during their youth. It wouldn't have been troublesome for Goran if the shadow wasn't so hollow! In every way possible, Myron was a useless cretin. He had no talent in anything barring living a prodigious lifestyle and whoring around. Yet, Myron could never do wrong in his father's eyes. Even Myron's superior cultivation was a result of an endless investment of potions and magical artefacts.\n\nDuring the final confrontation between Myron during the clan leader selections bouts, Goran was put in an extremely disadvantageous situation. Myron was fully decked out in top-of-the-line Epic grade enchanted equipment, while Goran was in cotton rags. \n\nThe scars from Goran's hard-fought victory that day still remained, etched deeply onto Goran's body. In fact, Myron had even used a few hidden weapons doused in malicious, lingering, poisons during the fight. If Goran hadn't met Nyla later on, he would have died as a tumorous, inhuman clump.\n\nNeedless to say, Goran held no affection for the aggravating man before him.\n\n\"What do you want, Myron?!\" Goran grunted as he carefully returned the books into the box. Seeing the malignant face of his half-brother had ruined his mood for indulging in them.\n\n\"Oh, big brother...\" Myron moaned with an exaggerated hurt expression. \"Why do you hate me so?\"\n\n\"Speak or you will be removed!\" Goran declared while unleashing the full might of his cultivation on Myron.\n\nMyron flinched slightly before regaining his earlier fawning facade. \"Big brother-\"\n\n\"It's Clan Leader,\" Goran interrupted, causing Myron to trip on his own words. After desperately struggling to curtail the twitch attacking the corner of his lips, Myron restarted.\n\n\"The clan is wondering why the... Clan Leader... chooses to spend more time outside his territory than within,\" Myron uttered in a strained manner.\n\nThe Solar Empire operated as a feudal society, with a few differences concerning internal politics. Below the Emperor were the Dukes, beneath whom were the Marquesses, then the Counts, the Viscounts and finally the Barons. Unlike the standard Feudalistic societies, these positions weren't awarded to individuals, rather they were assigned to the clans. So the leader of a clan may change regularly, however, the position would be eternally tied to the clan as long as the clan persisted. Of course, positions may rise and fall, or disappear altogether, depending on the whims of the Emperor and other such circumstances.\n\nThe leader of the Rasmus Clan was technically a Marquess who answered to the Duke of Maika. So it was truly unusual why Goran preferred to spend the majority of his time outside of his clan's territory.\n\n\"Does that even warrant an explanation? Do I need to remind you what those two kids of yours did to my Jean?\" Goran interrogated forcefully.\n\n\"Now, now, brother-\"\n\n\"Clan Leader.\"\n\nMyron exhaled through his nose in frustration and said, \"It was just kids playing around. Why would you take it so seriously?\"\n\n\"If I remember correctly, the last time I 'played around' with you as a child, I was reprimanded, caned, and denied food for an entire month. And I wasn't even the one who instigated the incident,\" Goran snorted.\n\nMyron smiled bitterly and decided to shift the conversation, \"I heard that big brother-\"\n\n\"Clan Leader.\"\n\n\"I heard that... Clan Leader... has invested in a new artwork? And that... Clan Leader... is nurturing the little artist behind the work as well\"\n\n\"Really? Where did you hear that?\" Goran retorted as he drilled his gaze more intensely.\n\n\"Here and there,\" Myron responded while waving his hand dismissively. The mansion was still under the Rasmus clan's ownership, even if it was primarily inhabited by Goran and his daughter. Inevitably, not everyone within the mansion answered solely to the Clan Leader. Even after purging and relocating some of the old staff members, some of the remaining hands had dual alliances.\n\n\"So where is it? I am interested in seeing what and who has caught the Clan Leader's eye this time!\" Myron said while slyly rubbing his hands together. If Guy were to see this, he would immediately be reminded of the stereotypical \"bad guys\" in the old melodramas from his past life.\n\nGoran sneered upon hearing Myron's excuse. Ever since he'd assumed the clan leader's position, Goran had been constantly attacked and undermined by Myron. During the early stages, these attacks were physical, as a show of defiance. Yet after consecutive quellings, Myron had mellowed out a bit, seemingly. However, Myron had pivoted to using more subtler means to attack Goran. Appealing to the council of elders, questioning Goran's decisions, sabotaging Goran's initiatives, and even targetting his daughter!\n\nThankfully, Myron wasn't some criminal mastermind who thought five to ten steps ahead. Goran could see Myron's intention from kilometres away, which offered him ample opportunities to implement countermeasures. The current situation was one of those cases as well. Basically, it was a well-known fact that Goran had a deep adoration for the arts. He often purchased artworks from auctions and directly from artists. Myron regularly made it a point to bring it up during clan gatherings to defame Goran based on his \"profligate spending\" from the clan's finances. This was Myron's shortsightedness. He overlooked the fact that Goran would later flip these art pieces for a substantially larger sum earning a net profit as a result.\n\n\"I've taken the initiative to enrol a slot under the clan's name for the recent exhibition at the Artist's Guild. Maybe you can show this amazing new art piece there?\" Myron said immediately after, leaving no pause for Goran to respond.\n\nGoran grit his teeth in anger and said, \"That. Was. Not. Necessary.\"\n\n\"Oh but big brother-\"\n\n\"Clan Leader.\"\n\n\"Clan. Leader. It's the first time you've taken interest in an artist like this - going as far as sponsoring them. He must truly be something special! Why not flaunt our discovery?\" Myron said with feigned kindness in his voice.\n\nGoran sighed internally upon witnessing Myron's shortsightedness once again. Myron's intention this time was to discredit Goran by bringing the inexperienced Kano into the limelight. Myron knew that the boy was still wet behind the ears and would flail miserably in front of a large, toxic crowd. Especially when the professional and veteran artists and critics would assault him with their incisive opinions and veiled personal attacks.\n\nBut what benefit would this bring Myron? Why was he discrediting the clan leader of the Rasmus clan in public? Wasn't Myron's family name Rasmus as well?!\n\nGoran gazed meaningfully at Myron's smug expression as he calculated his next step. He was initially planning to take Kano to the very same exhibition as an observer, not a participant. However, as he thought about it, Goran felt that presenting Kano's work would also be a perfect learning experience for the boy. Of course, he would have to coach the lad and toughen his metaphorical skin a little before that.\n\nAfter finalising his plan, Goran's contemplating expression turned into a disdainful sneer. He shot out, \"Little brother. Since you're also planning to attend the exhibition, I strongly suggest that you hire an expert art critic of your own. It wouldn't hurt to have someone who actually knows what they are talking about with you this time to... you know... save the clan some face.\"\n\nNoticing Myron's increasingly twisted expression, Goran smiled and continued, \"Having a knowledgeable individual would also save the clan some money, considering your previous purchase.\"\n\nThe hapless Myron had once tried to copy Goran and ventured into the art-sphere. In that attempt, Myron had once purchased a rather gaudy looking work, which was a poorly made counterfeit, after a random bloke hanging around an art auction convinced him that it was a famous work created by a hidden expert. In purchasing the forgery, Myron had used the entire allowance allotted by the clan for use in the auction. Not even their father could save Myron from the fierce reprimanding and detention doled out to him by the clan elders at that time.\n\nTo date, those within Goran's generation refer to Myron as \"Myron the Conned-oisseur\". It was a rather uninspired use of wordplay, but it irked Myron just as well. Besides, everyone recognised that Myron was so stupid he wouldn't get it if the jab got more inventive.\n\n\"I shall keep that in mind big-\"\n\n\"Clan Leader,\" Goran reminded gently with a faint smirk.\n\nMyron nodded in a strained manner and exited the salon immediately.\n\n\"Right, Mister Zola, where were we?\" Goran immediately shifted the conversation towards the man who was struggling to minimise his presence the entire time.\n\n\"*cough* Clan Leader Rasmus I was just leaving...\" Karmin answered with an awkward smile. He was on the edge of his seat in distress during the entire exchange before. He didn't know if he was supposed to hear any of that. No clan would want their dirty laundry aired out in public like that.\n\n\"Oh, alright. Someone should be here to receive you and guide you towards the exit,\" Goran replied calmly.\n\n\"Thank you for your time, Clan Leader Rasmus. It is much appreciated.\"\n\n\"The pleasure was all mine. Needless to say, I look forward to future cooperation between the Rasmus Clan and The Burning Forge.\"\n\nThat day, Karmin exited the mansion with a smile threatening to split his head in two, and a consciousness floating on cloud nine.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-119]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":100,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 117 - Same-Day Delivery","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Mister Zola! It's good to finally meet you!\" Goran greeted the much leaner man before him by grasping his extended hands firmly and shaking them.\n\n\"Clan Leader Rasmus! The pleasure is all mine!\" The man replied with reverence and respect in his voice.\n\n\"Please take a seat. The steel weapons and armours sold at the Buring Forge were well received by the clan. Most of our retained warriors have switched over,\" Goran commented as he welcomed the man towards a seat in the salon.\n\n\"That's good to hear! But I don't deserve the full credit, it was primarily Teacher Larks' initiative in developing steel after all,\" Karmin replied with a humble bow, seamlessly switching the direction of the conversation towards a common ground.\n\nKarmin was a smart businessman. Ever since the debut of the miraculous alloy known as steel, his business had been growing at an unprecedented rate. It was an unbelievable phenomenon, well beyond his own estimates. It first started with the standard weapons and armour sales. It took some time, and a lot of early investment, in marketing and convincing the population of the strength and equivalency of steel to Dwarven metal - given how the guild basically washed its hands of the entire situation.\n\nBut following the first few sales, things started to pick up organically. After all, quality always stands out, and steel was everything it was proclaimed to be. With the low cost of production, in both materials and manpower (thanks to Teacher Larks' magic-based streamlining), Karmin was able to transform nearly his entire iron backlog into steel in one fell swoop.\n\nAs more and more people started to indulge in The Burning Forge's steel equipment, Karmin inevitably attracted the attention of the haughty enchanters from the Smithing and Enchanting Guild. While before, Karmin was starved for choices, he was now facing an abundance! Some of those clowns who berated him to his face and shoved him out were now lining up to meet him whenever he graced the halls of the guild. They had no choice! Thanks to his advantageous contract, Karmin held a monopoly on steel - for the time being anyway.\n\nAfter siphoning through a boatload of possible applicants, Karmin settled on three promising and innovative enchanters who offered interesting avenues of research and development during their interviews. Unfortunately, they were only 1-star license holders, but Karmin saw potential in them and decided that it would be worthwhile to bankroll their advancement and thus tie them down to The Burning Forge.\n\nAnd this gamble turned out to be successful, as not a month later, The Burning Forge released their first line of enchanted weapons and armours. Through some trial and error, the enchanters found out that steel tended to form mana channels quite easily. Through some gentle nudging during the forging process, they could very easily define the channels required to facilitate the enchantments. The qualities of these mana channels rivalled those of more expensive alloys that were more conducive to enchantment due to having this same characteristic.\n\nWith this, The Buring Forge outputted a large quantity of low-cost high-quality enchanted gear that dominated the \"budget enchanted equipment\" market segment by a large margin. Karmin was satisfied with this because he knew that the high-end and bespoke market segments were where the bigger companies backed by years of history in their front pockets and one or more veritable mage powerhouses in their back pockets thrived.\n\nKarmin was infinitely grateful towards Teacher Larks. It was only because of his input and guidance that Karmin was able to bridge the empty gaps in his research and produce the revolutionary metal alloy. Luckily, Karmin recognised Teacher Larks' potential that day and formed an early connection with him. In fact, although Karmin was losing a significant percentage of profits to Teacher Larks, he wasn't the least bit affected or concerned. Karmin knew that Teacher Larks would go far. This was just a trifle amount to secure his own seat in Teacher Larks' coattail as he rose to the top!\n\nBut that wasn't enough. Karmin recognised that in order to properly secure his position in this ride destined towards greatness, he needed to take additional steps to ingrain himself further. So, Karmin didn't waste any time in researching Teacher Larks' backgrounds and connections. Surprisingly, he ended up falling short! The man literally sprung out of nowhere, with no history or family anywhere in sight. In many ways, Karmin was reminded of himself.\n\n'A self-made man!'\n\nHence Karmin expanded to the second degree - friends of friends. The only noteworthy connection Teacher Larks had was Teacher Jeeves. Even his student was an orphan from a far-off village. Teacher Jeeves never exposed himself to the public often, so Karmin wasn't left with many options chasing that lead. BUT, Karmin's highly effective network of agents did bring forward an interesting prospect. Apparently, the highly elusive Teacher Jeeves had an acquaintance with the current clan leader of the Rasmus Clan. It took some additional subtle probing and greasing a few hands with gold to substantiate this, but ultimately it was unearthed!\n\nWithout wasting a moment, Karmin immediately took action to build a new bridge. He did so in the only way he could, by throwing money and hoping that it stuck! Admittedly, it was a nouveau riche strategy often relegated as crass, but what other options did Karmin have? Karmin wasn't so lucky to be born with generational wealth, or an influential and powerful family, to build traditional relations with the Rasmus clan. The fact that Goran was entertaining Karmin in his clan mansion's salon did not alleviate Karmin's stress either. This was because Karmin knew that Goran was knowledgeable of his attempts to entrench himself in the Rasmus clan's graces as a way to tie himself to Teacher Larks.\n\nUltimately, this was the only option for Karmin. He knew that his life was limited, and unless he spawned a progeny sometime soon, The Burning Forge would disappear after his passing. And should such an event come to pass, if his company was tied to the much older Rasmus clan, then it would at least propagate albeit under the clan's seal.\n\n\"Speaking of, I recollect that Teacher Larks placed an order with The Burning Forge for a few crafting materials?\" Goran redirected stalled conversation.\n\n\"Right, I received Teacher Larks' mail for wood from the Menryl tree and sinews from the Illuminescent Banyan, as well as an assortment of mana-gems, enchanting tools, and some ink ingredients as well,\" Karmin affirmed.\n\n\"With regards to the cost-\"\n\n\"Please do not worry about that! Teacher Larks explicitly indicated to deduct the expenses from his account,\" Karmin interjected.\n\n\"I was worried about that...\" Goran muttered. \"I would like to pay on Teacher Larks' behalf.\"\n\n\"That...\" Karmin stuttered. This was going to be tough! For one, he wanted to respect Teacher Larks' instructions, but on the other hand, he couldn't afford to offend the leader of the Rasmus clan.\n\n\"Clan Leader Rasmus,\" Karmin said as he shifted slightly in his seat. \"Teacher Larks was adamant about this condition. He even went as far as to stress on it in his letter.\"\n\nGoran clicked his tongue in defeat and said, \"Forget it then.\"\n\n\"Teacher Larks did include something else with the mail!\" Karmin said and snapped his fingers multiple times as a discreet signal. Following a small pause, the doors to the salon opened and a large man bedecked in a pristine, fully-covered, enchanted armour walked in, carrying with him a jewel-crested metal box with four sets of locks and a series of both inconspicuous and blatantly visible locking and trap enchantments. Based on the bearing with which the object was carried in, Goran figured that it was probably something of high value.\n\nThe metal-covered man gently lowered the container in front of Goran, leaving a sufficiently large gap between them, and proceeded to unlock the physical locks using a set of keys produced from an off-coloured bag hanging by his thighs. After opening the third lock, he turned towards Karmin, who jolted in his seat and retrieved the final key from a necklace hanging around his neck.\n\n\"Teacher Larks sent for this just yesterday. I commissioned a rapid-transit courier service to facilitate same-day delivery: Swiftus. I opted for the most secure and safe delivery categories too,\" Karmin added.\n\nThe kneeling metal man grasped the extended key and unlatched the last lock. Following that, the man worked through the plethora of enchantments in seemingly random order. In actuality, there was a particular sequence that shifted at fixed intervals that only he knew. If the unlocking process didn't follow the set sequence, the box would not only combust and destroy the materials within, it would also destroy everything in a 500-metre vicinity. The man, however, worked without a moment of doubt or pause, or even fear of death!\n\nOnce the last enchantment was lifted, the container's lid opened up from the centre, releasing a translucent mist of mana that gushed out. The armoured man then activated a simple |Levitate| cantrip, causing a cloth-wrapped stack of objects to rise from the container. The man directed the stack on top of the table and gently lowered it. He then followed it up with a flourish of his hands causing the cloth to unwrap slowly, revealing a magnificent stack of books.\n\n\"Teacher Larks told me that he recently recollected a few interesting books during his meditation, thanks to his 'inheritance'. He said that you and his ward, Kano Reva, would find it interesting?\"\n\nGoran's eyes sparkled as they fluttered over the titles on the bound books before him:\n\n\"Impressionism: Van Gogh, Monet and Many More\"\n\n\"Deciphering Expressionism\"\n\n\"Extending Realism\"\n\nThose were just a few of the many, many other books in the stack. As he observed the bindings and the covers, Goran finally recollected what they were! He had seen Jean reading through ones like these before. They were bound similar to Teacher Larks' standard textbooks!\n\nAfter reading through the first book to the halfway point right then and there, Goran's eyes widened in excitement, \"Such interesting theories on visual art! These books are truly priceless! You did a wonderful job in preserving them during transit, Mister Zola. Truly, thank you!\"\n\nKarmin pumped his fist internally, in celebration. He had made the right decision! Sure, commissioning the courier cost him a pretty fortune, but it was all worth it!\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-118]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":101,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 116 - Fated Master and Disciple","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nGuy burst into frantic sweats when confronted with Krish's almost on-the-nose prediction.\n\n'D-Does he know?' Guy repeated internally.\n\nSurprisingly, his rhetorical question was answered by Mast's familiar, monotone voice, (It's only a hypothesis. To him, it is still uncertain.)\n\n'Now you show up?!' Guy interrogated.\n\n(I was busy.)\n\n'Doing what?!'\n\n(Managing a world...) Mast retorted with a hint of sarcasm.\n\nBut Guy didn't have time to contend with Mast's sass, he was quite literally being burned by Krish's unwavering and incisive gaze.\n\nAlmost by reflex, Guy revealed a strained chuckle and said, \"That doesn't seem possible. How can I be dead? I'm very much alive, as you can see.\"\n\n\"That's the thing! These physical eyes of mine can very well observe that you are hale and hearty. But it is what my Heavenly Eyes perceive that concern me. They haven't failed me to date, nor have they failed my Master, or his Master. In fact, since the inception of this school of magic, that hasn't been a single case where The Heavenly Eye has made a mistake,\" Krish declared with furrowed brows.\n\nHe then drastically raised the pressure focussed on Guy and inquired with a forceful tone, \"Tell me the truth! Are you a practitioner of Necromantic arts? Are you a Lich?\"\n\nGuy shook his head with great difficulty, \"N-No.\"\n\n\"Are you a product of or a summon of someone practising Necromantic arts?\" Krish inquired.\n\nGuy wasn't sure about how to go about answering that one. Through a pure technicality, Guy was, for all intents and purposes, a foreign soul inhabiting a soulless container. Was it not Necromancy by definition?\n\n\"N-No,\" Guy denied once again. As the last syllable escaped Guy's lips, the pressure amplified significantly.\n\n\"Lies!\" Krish bellowed. His voice reverberated within Guy's mind and threatened to burst through the orifices along with a mush of his internal organs.\n\n'Does he have some kind of a polygraph machine inside his head?' Guy cursed to himself.\n\nTo an extent, Guy's guess was correct. Krish used his highly sensitive mana sense to gauge various indicators across Guy's body all at once. Rhythmic changes in heartbeats, variations in sweat gland secretions, dilution or constriction of the pupils, microexpressions flashing across Guy's face, and many more. Krish had lived long enough, and interacted with a sufficiently large pool of people, to efficiently determine if someone was speaking the truth or not. Even the most proficient and emotionally detached sociopaths or psychopaths couldn't hide from him.\n\n\"I am not a product of or summon of a mage practising Necromantic arts!\" Guy forced out through gritted teeth.\n\n\"Tch!\" Krish clicked his tongue in annoyance and dissipated the pressure looming over Guy. \"Don't think that I didn't catch your shenanigans with semantics. Nonetheless, I know enough...\"\n\nAs Guy breathed heavily to recollect himself, he inquired, \"What DO you know?\"\n\n\"I know that you have died once, or at least this body has. BUT, after passing, either the soul was forcefully returned into the body or something similar took place-\"\n\n\"I did commit suicide!\" Guy quickly interjected. \"I hung myself due to some... trying circumstances. But I was told that possibly my passing triggered the activation of my inheritance- Right! I forgot to tell you about that! You see-\"\n\n\"I know about your inheritance,\" Krish interrupted and nodded solemnly. \"Although that does make sense, it still doesn't justify the drastic change in the flow of fate!\"\n\n\"Why are you so sure that it is me who caused this shift?\"\n\n\"If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not centaurs,\" Krish enunciated.\n\n\"Occam's Razor!\"\n\n\"Who's Occam?\"\n\n\"Nevermind...\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt me!\" Krish growled in annoyance. \"As I was saying, I don't believe in coincidences. Now that I think about it, it is a trait I share with that girl. Your arrival here was preceded by this shift in tide and I have a strong suspicion that it is you who caused it!\"\n\nGuy sighed in exasperation. He didn't know what to do to placate the emotionally charged man.\n\n'Hold up! Why am I the one being interrogated here?' Guy exclaimed internally. He expressly remembered coming down here to evaluate Krish as a prospective Master for Marie.\n\n\"Why are you so concerned about all this? Why does it even matter to you?\" Guy nudged.\n\nTo which Krish simply responded with a shrug, \"I have to ensure that my Disciple's environment is safe.\"\n\n\"Let's not jump the gun here.\"\n\n\"Again. It is a foregone conclusion, Guy,\" Krish commented while scratching his forehead. \"Let's get back to the issue at hand. Don't keep changing the topic!\"\n\nAt this point, Guy was tempted to retreat into the RoK and put on that forsaken metal mask resting on the table at the centre. He just wanted to sick the \"other guy\" on Krish and let him handle it. BUT, Guy still remembered Mast's warning. The Church was an aberrant creation that was completely out of Mast's calculation. And although it brought quite a few advantages, it was an unknown that could threaten Guy's life. Somehow, it even infiltrated into Guy's cultivation. Guy didn't know if it was a byproduct of his repeated and haphazard use of the metal mask, nor did he have any idea if he would incur additional damages because of it.\n\nIn fact, Guy didn't feel it necessary to shift faces to handle his current predicament. It wasn't life-threatening. If Krish wanted to kill him, he would have done so immediately. After all, he was definitely at a realm much higher than his own, and possibly even Teacher Jeeves' (but that was only a guess based on intuition). The man was simply suffering from excess curiosity after facing an inexplicable phenomenon. And, his curiosity hadn't yet reached a point where it overpowered his sense of morality. Otherwise, Guy would have been a vegetable by now after suffering a crushing spiritual invasion and thorough dissection by the man before him.\n\n\"Honestly, Krish, I don't know what to tell you...\" Guy uttered in exhaustion. And that was the truth. He wasn't sure if the shift that Krish referred to was caused by him or if it was a result of something else. Guy didn't even know what Krish saw to properly justify anything.\n\nKrish gazed meaningfully at Guy's unflinching expression and pulled the edge of his lips flatly into his cheeks in acceptance. \"I believe you...\" He muttered and lowered his imposing stance.\n\n\"It's just that seeing as my Disciple will be interacting with you more in the future, I wanted to make sure that she would be safe. You don't realise just how hard it is to come across someone fated to The Heavenly Eye. To tell you the truth, she's the only one I've found during the last 1000 years!\" Krish explained.\n\n\"Is it really that rare?\" Guy retorted impulsively. But then he doubled back, reassessed everything Krish said before and exclaimed, \"1000 years?! W-Wait, you're-\"\n\n\"Your guess is correct. I am in the Tesseract Transformation realm,\" Krish confessed with a smug expression.\n\nGuy's body collapsed completely upon hearing those words. 'What the hell was I thinking? Throwing my weight around with someone I didn't know anything about! I'm getting too arrogant for my own good.'\n\nKrish observed Guy's strained expression and chuckled mirthfully. Whenever he revealed his realm to someone, he would often receive two kinds of reactions. The first and most common, as well as the one Guy was currently embodying, was sheer horror and self-directed reproachfulness. The second, and the one Krish enjoyed the most, was disbelief and disdain through excess arrogance. He just loved it when others started to question his claims and challenged him as a show of dominance. Idiots, they were, but it was their idiocy that offered the greatest entertainment.\n\n\"Since my Disciple will be studying under you occasionally, I felt it prudent to evaluate your background,\" Krish explained with a feigned warm smile oozing with sarcasm. Guy recognised the irony as well, but he didn't have the guts to make any witty retorts. Heck, he was already on the brink of holding his breath lest he angers this man somehow!\n\n\"Great master,\" Guy began with an increasingly respectful tone. \"Y-You are comfortable with letting her study under me?\"\n\nGuy was more than ready to hand over Marie to Krish completely. Besides the fact that it would be a great opportunity for her, who was he to argue with the whims of an unreachable powerhouse in the Tesseract Transformation realm?\n\n\"It will do her good. I've seen what and how you teach. You are a good- no- a great teacher. Your personality and bearing, as well as the way you approach your students, are highly commendable and something that I myself yearn to achieve,\" Krish answered.\n\n\"You flatter me!\" Guy replied waving his hands.\n\n\"And besides that,\" Krish interrupted. \"I have a selfish motive as well.\"\n\nKrish leaned closer and whispered to Guy with a wry smile, \"The girl is too combative! I don't think I can handle her in her entirety all by myself.\"\n\nGuy snorted gaily and immediately covered his mouth. \"She is very inquisitive,\" Guy added. \"But I prefer it when they are like that. A quiet classroom can often mislead you into thinking that everyone is paying attention.\"\n\n____\n\nKrish and Guy continued their conversation, focusing more on lighter topics. Knowing that he was facing a mage at the peak, Guy was a lot less restricted in his words and opened up more. After all, he had personally experienced the consequence of deceiving the man.\n\nA few minutes into their conversation, the student's slumped behind him slowly started to gain clarity and awoke from their unconscious states.\n\n\"W-What happened?\" Markus muttered as he was the first to rise.\n\nFollowing him, Marie and Jean opened their eyes and observed their surroundings with raised suspicion.\n\n\"Good. You're all awake!\" Krish declared with an amiable smile. He then looked towards Guy and jerked his head as a sort of gesture.\n\n\"R-Right! So Marie,\" Guy started. \"After conversing with great master Nara here, I've determined that it would be a good opportunity for you to accept him as you Master,\" he encouraged.\n\nMarie's eyes widened in surprise and then mellowed out with gratefulness. She remembered that there were proper rituals that needed to be followed in order to officiate the Master-Disciple relationship, and rose with a sudden leap. She rushed forward, stood in front of Krish, and got down on her knees.\n\n\"I, Marie Reva, gratefully accept-\" She began. However, Krish waved his hand, causing Marie's body to straighten into a standing posture with a sudden yank.\n\n\"We can skip the formalities,\" he interjected. \"As I've said before, you and I are fated as Master and Disciple. I've already accepted you as my Disciple, now that you've accepted me as your Master, there is no need for unnecessary and frivolous shows.\"\n\nKrish turned towards Guy once again and transmitted a few quick instructions through Mana Transmission.\n\n\"Right! Great master Nara and I have discussed your schedule. You will join Markus and Jean for the general lessons in the morning. Following that, you will join them for the lessons on magic every other day starting from tomorrow. For the remainder of the days, you shall pursue your training under your Master.\"\n\n\"Wait! So you allow for my attendance in Teacher Larks' lessons?\" Marie asked Krish with an incredulous expression.\n\n\"I didn't want to, but then your Teacher here was adamant that I allow you to pursue something you enjoyed,\" Krish falsely admitted with a convincing defeated expression. \n\n\"It was a hard fight, but I managed to convince him,\" Guy added in good-hearted fun. \"You've got yourself a very strong Master, Marie. Much stronger and more capable than I,\" he then admitted.\n\n\"Him?\" Marie snorted in disbelief.\n\n\"Marie,\" Markus hissed from the side. \"Show some respect. He's your Master now!\" He reminded her.\n\nKrish wore a strained expression and looked towards Guy with a gaze that said, 'See what I'll have to deal with?!'\n\n\"*sigh* It's all well and good to be sceptical and critical about stuff. It's how you become a more learned person. But if the same scepticism turns you into someone incapable of accepting anything new, you are never going to grow, Marie. You must channel that curiosity towards more constructive prospects,\" Guy explained.\n\nSurprisingly, Marie wore an extremely serious expression and nodded immediately in understanding. Krish's mouth dropped agape before his face warped with a bitter smile.\n\n'How long will it take for her to listen to me like that?' He lamented.\n\nWhen Guy received Marie's undivided and genuine gaze of recognition, the Krish started to feel jealous of Guy. For that man had managed to get through to his Disciple before even he did.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-117]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":102,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 115 - Marie Reva","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nMarie spent the rest of the day yesterday, and early morning of today going through her decision once again. After all, she wasn't one to make impulsive decisions. And it was during this contemplation that Marie realised her true drive in wanting to learn magic. Why was she so enamoured with learning how to predict the future like great master Nara? It was to preserve what she had and what she held so dearly and close to her heart: her family.\n\nHowever, finding her resolution was one thing, presenting this in front of Teacher Larks was another. Marie recognised that it would be selfish and utterly disrespectful of her to put forth the request of entering great master Nara's discipleship as well as indulging in Teacher Larks' enlightening lessons. For one thing, Teacher Larks was providing her with the benefits completely free of cost - at least great master Nara attached a stringent requirement to his offer. This in and of itself greatly troubled Marie and gnawed away at her until she finally entered a perturbed sleep.\n\nMarie woke up with a heavy heart early in the morning; she was fully prepared to sacrifice her interest in favour of what she considered her responsibility. Yet she decided that it would be unfortunate if she left without trying. The only reason Marie even bothered to bring up the idea in front of Teacher Larks was that over the past few weeks of interacting with the man, she understood his personality perfectly. She knew that Teacher Larks didn't hold any expectations with her. He taught her because he enjoyed teaching. He indulged Markus and Jean, as well as the other kids from the village because he liked interacting with them. And he offered his services for free because he had no great ambitions. Still, the reason why such a brilliant man, with a mind filled with ideas and thoughts well beyond his generation, had decided to slum it out in such a backwater village was beyond Marie's understanding.\n\nNonetheless, Marie was confident that Teacher Larks wouldn't take offence in her impertinence, and she was right. But what she didn't expect was that Teacher Larks accepted her proposal and even went as far as to probe great master Nara to test his credibility as her prospective Master. An unusual feeling welled up from within Marie as she followed the stable figure leading her down the steps to the village.\n\nIt was the feeling that she seemingly yearned for, but didn't know about until she experienced it herself for the very first time. Was it security? Dependence? The feeling of having someone to rely on?\n\nAlthough she'd lived with Matron Reva for a long time now, Marie never felt this way before. It wasn't that Matron Reva wasn't dependable. Rather, Marie could feel that Matron Reva had her burdens to carry, and it wouldn't be proper to dump her's on top of all of that. But then why did she feel more secure and comfortable in unburdening herself with Teacher Larks? Was it because he was a man? Unlikely. Because if so, she would feel equally dependent on Markus even if the boy was younger than her. Then was it because he was a mage? Maybe. Strength did offer some solace.\n\nYet Marie felt it was most likely because Teacher Larks did not look like someone with the weight of life bearing down on them. He just looked so carefree, and in control. Yes. That was what Marie yearned for! Control...\n\n'Teacher Larks cares for me!' Marie's supposed cynical facade completely shattered as a feeling of warmth wrapped all around her, finally showering her with a sense of reassurance that she desperately yearned for.\n\n\"Maybe he isn't so bad after all,\" she muttered to herself in an inaudible voice.\n\n____ \n\n(And that's five,) Mast's voice echoed in Guy's mind.\n\n\"Huh?\" Guy paused. \"Who?\"\n\n(The girl,) Mast hinted.\n\nGuy chuckled internally with excitement upon hitting the milestone towards unlocking the remaining portion of the RoK. He anticipated the addition of Marie towards the count, however, after trying time and time again and failing, he was close to giving up on getting through to the girl.\n\n'So stubborn,' Guy commented internally. The girl had insane trust issues that troubled Guy to no end. She did open up recently. For instance, as they were descending the steps, she went as far as to explain her findings of the soothsayer named Krish Nara and his powers, as well as her interest and goal with entering his discipleship.\n\nAll that aside, now that the RoK had tagged five students, Guy was even more elated as he could access the more advanced books from high-school level and above.\n\n'You could have just left everything open from the start, you know. What was the point of placing the barriers anyways?' Guy said.\n\n(Motivation,) Mast added. (I found that most humans tend to work harder if they are provided with clear objectives and targets. Otherwise, they revert to laziness and sloth.)\n\n'Motivation to do what? I thought this was just a second shot for me? I thought I was free to do whatever I wanted?'\n\n(Sure,) Mast replied curtly.\n\nGuy wanted to continue the discussion, and possibly explore the new books available to him as well, but he didn't have the time to do so just yet. Because right then, the group had arrived at the base of the steps. They turned to the left and, following a short minute, they arrived in front of great master Nara's cottage. Just as Teacher Larks reached forward to knock on the door, it swung open gently and a calm voice echoed through, \"You can come in. The door's open.\"\n\nGuy walked in and greeted Krish with a warm smile, followed by his students.\n\nKrish lowered his head lightly in acceptance and beckoned for the group to take a seat. Although Guy had been in Krish's cottage before, he was still impressed by his minimalist lifestyle. There weren't many items of furniture or material possessions decorating the desolate household. The last time he was here, there was only a rattan bed frame with a thin mattress - that still looked barely used - and a single wooden chair. Today, surprisingly, there were three more chairs placed conspicuously in front of the bed, where Krish was seated with crossed legs.\n\n\"You were expecting us?\" Guy probed.\n\n\"I was shown that it would be today,\" Krish replied.\n\n\"So you must already know why I'm here?\"\n\n\"I do. But I'd like to hear it from you,\" Krish beamed back.\n\n\"Marie here has informed me that you are willing to accept her as your Disciple if she is interested in learning your cultivation art,\" Guy started.\n\n\"Yes. The girl is fated to The Heavenly Eye. There is no escaping it,\" Krish interjected.\n\n\"Then as her guardian by proxy, it is my duty to ensure that she is in safe hands,\" Guy pointed out with a firm tone.\n\nKrish chuckled ominously and said, \"It's not like you can stop it from happening. The girl's mind is set-\"\n\n\"No, it's not!\" Marie interrupted. \"I-If Teacher Larks denies it, then I won't become your disciple.\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me, girl. If it were so easy to change your mind, you wouldn't have gone around asking others in the village about me,\" Krish replied with a sly grin.\n\nHe then snickered in seeing the girl's mouth bursting agape. \"Nothing misses these eyes.\"\n\nMarie realised that she was losing the upper hand and immediately narrowed her eyes sternly. She calmed her wavering mind and snapped down in protest, \"If Teacher Larks denies it, I will not become your disciple!\"\n\nAs she punctuated her declaration, a subtle change transpired invisible to the eyes of everyone in the room barring Krish whose eyes nearly burst out of their sockets in shock.\n\n'This girl! She- She's changing the flow subconsciously!'\n\n\"Fine! Fine! I was only messing around with you!\" Krish barked back hastily. He noticed the shifting clouds of fate settle through his Heavenly Eye and heaved a sigh of relief. \n\nHe then turned to Guy and commented cautiously, \"You know, back in the day, scores of mages would line up for days to enter my discipleship, only to be denied.\"\n\nGuy nodded with a mirthful exhale and said, \"They wanted to become your disciples, but were turned down by you. In this case, though, you were the one who proposed the discipleship to Marie. Therefore, she must also have the right to decline. Besides, she's told me something interesting about your power.\"\n\nHe then leaned forward, cradled his chin on his palms and spoke with a measured and incisive tone, \"You said that Marie is fated with The Heavenly Eye. She cannot learn it if you don't teach her. If she doesn't learn it then it isn't technically her fault, but yours. Furthermore, it would lead to a deviation in the natural flow of fate, which, according to a little birdie, results in a backlash of some sort. Since you are the one at the centre of this deviation... I think you know where I am going with this.\"\n\nKrish wore a bitter expression and exhaled loudly in defeat. \"I misjudged you a little, Guy Larks... Fine, I'll appease your apprehension. You're here to determine if I am capable enough to be this girl's Master, correct?\"\n\nWithout waiting for a response, Krish removed his suppressed cultivation and unleashed an invisible pressure in waves. It started breezily, but then quickly rose in strength with every passing second.\n\nMarie was the first to succumb to the pressure and lose her consciousness. She was then followed by Jean, whose expression didn't budge an inch. Markus managed to hold out for a while longer, but he too collapsed just as easily.\n\n'I can't gauge his cultivation! He's definitely stronger than I am. But by how much?' Guy thought to himself with great difficulty as he tried to withstand the increasing pressure.\n\nOnce Markus slumped down into his seat, the rising tension plateaued, and then started to drop.\n\n\"Is this sufficient?\" Krish smirked.\n\n\"What is your cultivation realm?\" Guy asked through measured breaths as he tried to stabilise his racing heart.\n\n\"Higher than yours,\" the man answered cheekily. \"You didn't answer my question.\"\n\n\"I am comforted to know that you can protect Marie. But I still have some concerns about your cultivation art. You should know exactly why Marie is so inclined towards prediction and future sight.\"\n\n\"The girl desires control and surety.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And while I'm impressed by your track record and efficacy, I need to ascertain it one last time for my own peace of mind,\" Guy concluded.\n\nKrish nodded along in understanding and entered silent contemplation. He stayed that way for a whole minute before looking directly into Guy's eyes and speaking with a morose tone, \"When I came to this village, I inspected everyone present with my ability. At that time, I saw nothing of value in this village. It was shown that the village would remain as such for maybe half a century before decaying and fading away with time, just like every other place I passed through. But then the very next day, something happened. Everything changed! The village that was quaint and without purpose gained an auspicious coating unlike any other. It was surprising because this never happens.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Guy uttered in a low tone.\n\n\"It. Never. Happens. Fate is static, it never changes. People only think that they have control over their lives and their futures, but they don't. NO ONE can change fate. But then it did change!\"\n\n\"You said that you can change the future. Maybe it was the result of someone else like you-\"\n\n\"There is NO ONE else like me. Believe me. There is no other cultivation art in this world like The Heavenly Eye,\" Krish accentuated confidently.\n\nHe then resumed his monologue, \"A change so drastic can only mean one thing: Someone strong- Someone immensely powerful had made a play. Someone strong enough to execute a shift so drastic and sudden, yet without causing nary a ripple!\"\n\nKrish showed a faint smile and said, \"I stayed here for maybe a year? Waiting for the cause to show up, after all the perpetrator returns to the scene of the crime nine-out-of-ten times. And that was when I saw you, Guy Larks - A man with a fate so murky he should be dead. Yet there he was, walking and talking without a hint of death lingering over him.\"\n\nKrish copied Guy's earlier posture and rested his chin on his hands. He then gazed intently at Guy's warped expression and directed a mote of his power to raise the tension.\n\n\"So, Guy Larks, exactly who, or what, are you?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-116]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":103,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 114 - Safeguarding the Family","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nA wave of mana burst out from Markus as an uncontrollable rage boiled over from within. Being only at the Late Stage of Mana Condensation realm, this wave couldn't have made it far, but Marie was much too close to Markus and had unwittingly taken a decent brunt of the damage. She started to sweat profusely as her mental sirens screamed out in fear. Jean, who happened to be next to Marie, also suffered a similar backlash. Fortunately, or unfortunately, her general detachment from her emotions had left her face sporting a rather calm expression. But the rest of her body wasn't inert, and her back was thus completely drenched in sweat.\n\nBut Markus wasn't completely lost in his outburst. He took an elongated breath and immediately retracted his inadvertently forceful mana projection. \"Sorry,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"But Big Sis, do you realise what you're proposing is extremely disrespectful to Master?\" Markus continued with a stern tone.\n\nMarie breathed a sigh of relief following the reprieve and answered with a bitter smile, \"I know that, Markus. I know that is an extremely presumptuous and shameless request. But I wouldn't do so if I didn't have any other choice.\"\n\nGuy coughed to interject the conversation from heating up again and asked, \"What do you mean by that, Marie?\"\n\nAs he finished that question, he gazed deep into Marie's eyes with interest. He'd recognised this girl's character right at their first personal interaction.\n\n'She isn't one to make half-hearted and miscalculated decisions,' Guy affirmed. That just wasn't her character. In many ways, she reminded him of his elder brother in his previous life.\n\n\"Goal-oriented and sharp\" is what one interviewer published in a renowned annual business review magazine. Guy's brother never took risks. What people considered to be a shakey venture, his brother could turn into a sure shot through ingenious machinations and brain-frying calculations. In fact, Guy's brother was the sole reason why Larks Enterprises rose to such heights in his lifetime. His successes weren't free of jealous gazes and antagonistic relationships, though. But none that dared to oppose his brother stood a chance.\n\n\"Insects buzzing around a feast, but too cowardly to take a bite,\" was the exact phrase his brother had used to describe them.\n\nBut only Guy and his family knew the true face of the demon feared by everyone in the capitalist world. Deep down, his elder brother was the most selfless and family-oriented man he had ever met, barring his father of course. Every decision made, every investment, every move actioned within the enterprise was for the sole benefit, growth and safety of the family. The world could go to hell for all that mattered, as long as the family could hold on to the least ravaged section his elder brother would willingly sacrifice everything.\n\nYet, why did he always wear such an impassive face and hold such a cynical worldview? That was mainly because of the tragic loss his brother had faced in his youth when he tried to launch his start-up with a few of his University roommates. At first, everything was harmonious. The group had developed revolutionary software that tracked market trends and predicted an optimal investment spread offering the safest and greatest returns. The entire thing was built on his brother's algorithm and had a success rate of over 85%.\n\nHis brother wanted to start as a small trading and investment firm and organically grow by amassing a loyal client base looking for stable and long-term growth. His roommates agreed at first. When the big-hitters in the field came knocking and threw around their weight, the team held strong. That was until one specific company offered a ridiculous amount to buy out their entire firm.\n\nOf course, Guy's brother refused. But the allure of wealth wasn't so easily averted. His so-called business partners didn't hesitate to stab him in the back, sell out and join the competition. It would have been fine if it was just that, but one of them stole the algorithm that his brother developed. The friends he'd shared a room and his dreams with had turned on him without an afterthought.\n\nHis brother filed a lawsuit for patent violation, but the competitor simply dragged out the court case using their connections till it became a cash sink.\n\nHis brother had started the venture with his own hard-earned money. Not a penny had been drawn from the family's accounts. Till the very end, his brother refused to involve his family and drag them through the mud in the process.\n\nYet once bitten twice shy - his brother had learned a valuable lesson which had unfortunately marred his entire outlook on society. \n\n\"Trust no one, but blood.\"\n\nThose tied to you by blood would never, in good conscience, stab you in the back. It may be the byproduct of a loving family that cemented such a naive worldview in his brother's mind. In fact, Guy's eldest sister-in-law had the hardest time trying to break through his elder brother's near impervious outer casing. But after years of active pursuit and suffering the emotional distress of unrequited love, she had cracked through and forcefully tweaked Guy's brother's life philosophy.\n\n\"Trust no one, but blood... and my wife!\"\n\nIt was the exact same impression Guy perceived when he conversed with Marie properly for the first time. The girl was boorish and cynical. She never trusted anything at face value. The worst part was that if someone told her the world was round, she would immediately assume the opposite end of the argument and reason her way towards the right answer through a series of anger-inducing and forcefully antagonising questions and debates. It wasn't that the girl was stupid. No! Her mind worked like Guy's brothers - unmatched in its efficiency. The way she crunched through numbers was akin to how a piano virtuoso's finger's danced on the keyboard, elegant and without dalliance. But she was argumentative by nature. She was the worst kind of student any teacher could ask for!\n\nBut when it came to her family, the girl would immediately bend over backwards. It was the sole reason why she even deigned to obey Guy with a partly open mind - because Guy was Markus' Master. Guy knew that it would be near impossible for anyone else to enjoy the same benefits. 'So who in their right mind is willing to take this girl as their apprentice?' Guy wondered with a low snort.\n\nMarie's expression faltered with a trace of distress at Guy's piercing gaze. She was a little fearful of the man due to the power he held as a mage. But something inside her actively suppressed this feeling and washed her with a sense of comfort. Her gut told her that Guy wouldn't be offended, he wasn't that kind of a man. Yet she was apologetic to Guy for bringing it up, however, she HAD no other options.\n\n'Rather than becoming preoccupied with the what, evaluate the why,' Is what that man told her. And it was by following this vague thread that Marie found her true calling.\n\n\"I want to become a mage to keep my family safe,\" Marie affirmed.\n\n\"Like Markus?\" Guy inquired.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" She corrected. \"Going through dark and unknown woods, you take a wrong turn and come face to face with a ferocious beast. To protect is to defend against the beast through superior strength or cunning defence. To keep safe is to avoid taking the wrong turn altogether.\"\n\n\"Foresight, is it?\" Guy asked as clarification.\n\nMarie hummed in affirmation and expounded with an unwavering tone, \"I don't seek power. All I care for is to keep this small world of mine safe and unaffected. In fact, this has been my drive since the very beginning. But I recognised that such a farfetched ambition was beyond my reach. In planning contingencies for everything that might take place, I will inevitably miss the opportunity to take action. And that does not even take into consideration the events that are vaguely connected which can sometimes interfere with the outcome.\"\n\nShe paused, and then declared with a resolute expression, \"But that was until the possibility was presented before me. So that is why I am putting forth such this request, Teacher Larks.\"\n\n\"Although you are still a teenager, you are mature beyond your years, Marie. Once you've set your mind to something, you won't ever let it go, so what reason is there to ask me for permission?\" Marie blushed in embarrassment in hearing such an apt evaluation of her psyche.\n\n\"So I won't deny you right away. But I am interested to know just why you wish to continue studying under me as well? I figured that you would completely transfer your tutelage to your new Master?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"One is means to an end, the other is something I enjoy from the bottom of my heart,\" Marie replied with a bright smile. \"To gain the ability to protect my family, I need to pursue discipleship. Yet I am selfish and do not wish to drop what I enjoy, which is learning under you, Teacher Larks.\"\n\nGuy clicked his tongue and waved his hand aggressively, \"I don't know where you learned to talk so sweetly.\"\n\nHe then added, \"I almost forgot to address the massive elephant in the room!\"\n\nGuy leaned forward and narrowed his eyes suspiciously, \"Who is this Master you're so eager to follow anyways? Before you do anything irreversible, I want to meet this person as well!\"\n\nMarie nodded vehemently and answered, \"It's great master Krish Nara.\"\n\n\"Big Sis, are you talking about the travelling soothsayer living in the village?\" Markus interjected.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGuy coughed loudly to mask a disdainful snort that was about to escape him. In his past life, Guy had heard of many individuals who practised arcane pseudo-sciences such as astrology, numerology, palmistry, and so on. While he respected those that practised these rites as some form of religious or traditional ritual, he was generally averse to those that shilled the less informed of their wealth in the form of false pretences. Be that as it may, Guy didn't use to properly believe in those pseudo-sciences. He firmly believed that one was the driver of their own fate.\n\nHowever, that was all before he passed away at a young age and met a being equivalent to a god and was transmigrated to a world filled with unbelievable phenomena, like magic. So, Guy quickly suppressed his scorn. 'Who knows? In this world of magic, those pseudo-sciences may actually be effective!'\n\n\"That's it, it's decided!\" Guy declared as she sprang up from his seat. \"We're going to meet this person and discuss your discipleship. If I am not satisfied then I will have to put my foot down.\"\n\n\"W-What?\" Marie muttered in disbelief.\n\n\"That's right. If I find anything suspicious the I will also inform Grace.\"\n\n\"But you can't do that!\" Marie exclaimed immediately. It was one thing to argue against Teacher Larks, it was a whole other battlefield in contending against Matron Reva!\n\n\"Why not? It's my duty as your guardian to protect the misinformed minors under my protection.\"\n\n\"You can't do that!\" Marie tried to rebuke again, yet right as the words left her mouth Guy had already walked out with Markus and Jean in tow, the former wearing a light smile while trying to suppress his laughter.\n\n\"W-Wait for me!\" Marie cried out as he hurriedly followed the group with a brisk jog.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-115]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":104,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 113 - Embarrassing Aftermath","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy couldn't help but frown as he exited The Church and returned to the \"real world\". While he'd learned quite a bit about his special \"cheat-system\", especially about its connection with his cultivation, he had also discerned a huge stumbling block that may turn out to be problematic for him in the future.\n\n'It's really impossible for me to recreate a scene purely from my imagination. I have to have personally experienced it.'\n\nIn trying to teach the kids about cellular division, Guy had inevitably reverted to a few frames from his past memory as a crutch. The first scene on human skin was taken directly from his observations through a high-precision microscope in his school lab. At that time, he and his lab partner had taken turns peering at each other's skin specimen. Guy had simply pulled that experience and built upon it to produce a near-realistic FIVR-type visual.\n\nEvidently, the result was acceptable barring the infrequent issues pointed out by Markus that sometimes pulled him out of the immersion.\n\nIt was when Guy tried to present the second scene that everything started to fall apart. Guy wanted to see if he could mould the reality inside the |Soul Imprint| to his will, just like the \"other guy\". After all, that plagiarising hack had essentially copied segments from Neil Degrasse Tyson's Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey frame for frame and packaged it as some sort of an enlightening experience for Markus. Why couldn't Guy do the same?\n\n'I don't wanna pull the typical transmigrator card... But the usual transmigrator MCs have a field day appropriating inventions, discoveries and literature from their original world and publicising it in the new world as their own. Why can't I do that as well?'\n\nMaybe it was some kind of misplaced arrogance after experiencing successive breakthroughs that had crept into Guy's idle mind, but he was feeling extremely adventurous. So, Guy decided to pull out one of his memories from middle school when he had seen a video in his biology class about the miracle of childbirth. At that time, it was a vomit-inducing watch for himself and his fellow immature peers. Guy wanted to experience the schadenfreude of putting his own students through it.\n\nHowever, Guy was immediately faced with multiple issues when he tried to materialise the scene down to the sensory inputs. He had to tailor the experience individually by frame, stacking up the precise data the observer's senses must experience at all points in space. After a point, Guy found himself extremely exhausted. Thus, he gave up and restricted the sensory range to inside the school bus which was within his manageable range.\n\nThe next problem turned out to be the visual itself. While in the beginning, Guy intended to tailor it based on the informational video he'd seen before, things started to go wrong almost immediately when rogue thoughts invaded his mind, causing the visual to destabilise. It should have been an innocent scene where they were shown how sperm cells were produced leading up to the fertilisation of the egg cell and then finally ending with the cell division of the zygote to form a foetus.\n\nBut the human mind is a fickle thing. Through connections based on sheer idiocy, Guy's mind started to swim through a plethora of depraved thoughts based on a few adult videos he'd viewed in his past life. It wasn't even a complete distraction, a mere afterthought. The scene barely flashed through his brains for a millisecond, yet it happened to have strength far greater than the educational scene Guy had been so tirelessly trying to recreate.\n\nThe damn thing nearly took over. Thank goodness that Guy had the presence of mind to gain control over the reins in the last second and trimmed away the R-18 portions that had unwittingly invaded his mind. Otherwise, he'd have to answer to Grace, and explain to her why the children had been shown pornographic content.\n\nGuy shuddered just thinking about it.\n\nRegardless of all that, the trip had been fruitful. Guy realised that his cultivation truly was tied to the hitherto unknown \"cheat-system\" offshoot that had materialised within his mana core. Every time Guy utilised The Church to provide insights to his students to push their cultivation forward, he would receive feedback from his students in the form of his own cultivation. This feedback wasn't taxed from his student, it appeared to have formed from within his own body.\n\nThe nature of this feedback was close to an energising, nutrient-rich, infusion of arcane insights and knowledge directly into Guy's core that urged his mana to circulate in a particular fashion. What was this insight about? It was primarily packets of information about his own students, their preferences, approach to learning, the way they think, the depth and breadth of their understanding, and so on. It was like an abstract spreadsheet that was constantly updated in Guy's mind.\n\nGuy found that The Church was doing most of the heavy-lifting and back-end work such as circulating the mana as though cultivating, and so on. As long as Guy could farm a steady stream of such feedback, The Church could potentially boost him all the way to immortality!\n\nBut Guy was most grateful that his cultivation wasn't parasitic. Guy verified this by inspecting Jean after he had exited The Church. For one, there wasn't any visible flow of mana or transfer of any sort between her and him. Although, there was a strand of bright ethereal string connecting them. Guy had seen a much thicker rope doing the same between him and Markus - he had used it to access Markus' core space before. Its purpose apart from that was still a mystery that Guy was looking forward to investigating as soon as an opportunity presented itself.\n\nIt was interesting that Jean and Markus managed to learn something out of this rather disturbing trip. Of course, the feedback Guy had received from Jean was markedly greater than that from Markus when both of them had only seen this for the first time.\n\n'Although the test variables are totally uncontrolled, I can hypothesise that the student's perceptivity to certain knowledge and insight also play a key role in how much they can absorb and send over to me as feedback. This could be both advantageous and disadvantageous.' That is, while this strategy reduces the possibility of corruption and biases leaking through from Guy's own perspective into theirs, there is a greater burden on the students themselves to absorb and internalise the insights to the best of their abilities. This is in contrast to the standard |Soul Imprint| in which the knowledge is directly transplanted into the receiver's brain.\n\nAnyways, Guy wasn't in any mood to dwell further on those theories for the time being. Because right now, he was trying his hardest to hide in embarrassment and avoid his student's gazes.\n\nIn fact, both of his students had the same idea as each of them were sliding down their chairs and shrinking their crimson-tinged faces into their clothes. What had started as a very educational tour had somehow taken a drastic left turn, and none of them were really prepared to experience it...\n\nLike that, the room maintained a charged silence,\n\nGuy was wracking his mind on ideas to break through the metaphorically metre-thick barrier of ice, when Marie's voice resounded through, saving him as an angel descended from the heavens.\n\n\"What's going on? Why's everyone so quiet? Did I miss something?\" She rattled off as she cautiously walked in. Her critical gaze scanned the room and quickly grasped on to the flustered atmosphere lingering around. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she folded her arms over her chest and scratched her chin.\n\n\"Something shady took place here and it's got you two kids all red. And Teacher Larks looks completely ashamed of himself...\" The girl started to mutter out loud her hypothesis, causing the kids and Guy to shrivel up further and further.\n\n\"No way!\" She finally exclaimed, slapping her hand onto her agape mouth in surprise.\n\n\"Teacher Larks! You didn't!\" She accused in shock.\n\n\"I-I didn't what?\" Guy stuttered.\n\n\"D-Did your trousers fall loose by accident?\" The girl shrieked with an undertone of humour in her voice.\n\n\"*cough* What?\" Guy nearly choked on his saliva as he retorted incredulously. He waved his hands in front of him while wheezing his lungs out, \"*cough* Nothing of that sort *cough* happened!\"\n\nBut Marie wasn't one to believe others so easily. \"You two! Tell me everything!\" She demanded and squeezed close to Jean.\n\n\"B-Big Sis. You shouldn't disrespect Master like that,\" Markus reminded as he shifted in his seat.\n\n\"Pshhht! Teacher Larks doesn't mind that, right?\" Marie threw out with a sly grin on her face.\n\nGuy finally caught his breath and retorted with a slightly hoarse throat, \"Why are you so late today, Marie?\"\n\nMarie's grin was smothered in the cradle upon hearing that question. She wore a bitter expression and answered, \"I... *sigh* I think I have a goal towards learning magic-\"\n\nGuy raised his eyebrows in surprise, \"Really? That's great! So what is it?\"\n\n\"Before I tell you that... I have a presumptuous request, Teacher Larks.\"\n\n\"As long as it is within my power, and isn't too outrageous, no request is too presumptuous,\" Guy replied with a lighthearted smile and slight rhythm in his voice.\n\n\"I've seen the kind of magic Markus and Jean are practising. It is a lot different from what I've seen other mages their age use. I like it because it makes sense, and I am very much interested in learning it myself. However... I... wish to accept someone else as my Master!\"\n\n\"Marie!\" Markus blurted out with a forceful tone and anger flaring in his eyes. \"I've tolerated enough of your nonsense! Apologise to Master, now!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-114]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":105,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 112 - See Men on My Skin","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nNonetheless, the near-perfect visual offered tonnes of opportunities for the two students to gain a plethora of varied insights that they would have missed through the usual investigative methods. For instance, after removing some of the flaking skin cells from the surface, the two were able to closely observe the process of Mitosis in skin cells.\n\n\"As you can see, the old skin cells underneath create a copy of themselves through Mitosis and push themselves higher until they reach the surface. With skin, it usually takes about a day for this process - so this representation is obviously accelerated to make it easier for you guys to understand,\" Guy elaborated.\n\n\"This process is similar with other organs and body parts as well. The old cells replicate themselves and fall off, and new cells take their place.\"\n\nMarkus raised his hands and asked, \"Master. If that is the case... Does that mean that once all the cells of the body are replaced following a single Mitosis cycle... We become a completely new person?\"\n\n\"That is an interesting question, Markus. There is actually a parable that discusses this line of reasoning. The thought experiment goes as follows: Let's say that you own a ship. It's been passed down through the ages from ancestor to ancestor, and it has finally fallen into your hands. Every generation, a part of the ship fails due to age. The ancestor that owned the ship at that time fixed or replaced the part to bring the ship back into working condition. This pattern continues until it reaches you, by which time the ship has been technically remodelled completely. Now the question remains: Is the ship in your possession, the same ship that's been in your family's possession since the start?\"\n\n\"It has to be!\" Jean answered.\n\n\"And why is that?\"\n\n\"Because once a new part is added to the ship, it essentially becomes a part of the ship itself. Besides, the ship's identity isn't tied to its external appearance, it's what is within that matters,\" She continued.\n\n\"Can we extend this to sentient beings? Can I replace every single part and organ in my body, and still be considered Guy Larks?\"\n\n\"That...\"\n\n\"That would be impossible,\" Markus interjected. \"There are some organs that you just can't replace without losing your identity.\"\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"The brain, for one!\"\n\n\"But the brain DOES naturally replace itself, cell by cell. What about then?\"\n\nThis time, Jean chimed in, \"Technically, it creates a copy of itself. So it isn't being replaced.\"\n\n\"By that logic, if I can grow a copy of my brain outside my body, and then switch my existing brain with that one, I will still remain the same person?\"\n\nThat question elicited an extended pause from his students.\n\n\"It's fine to not know the answer to some questions. Sometimes, these incisive questions and thought experiments are simply there to make you think and consider your actions more carefully. By scientific reasoning, it is possible to test the theory by literally growing a copy of someone's brain and performing a transplant. Given the nigh unlimited possibilities provided by magic, I believe it is well within our limits to do so. But is it the right thing to do?\"\n\nGuy paused to let the thesis sink in before elaborating, \"Science is driven by reason and objectivity. Every question has an answer given sufficient depth of study. Magic makes it infinitely easier to do so. BUT! In our pursuit of the objective truth, if we lose track of our humanity, what inhibits society from degenerating into chaos? That is where we must evaluate the morality and ethicality of our works. I know that this explanation is a huge tangent from our lesson's focus, but it warrants consideration especially since you guys are starting off in the path of magic where lines can get blurry.\"\n\nAt that point, Jean hurriedly raised her hand and inquired, \"It is known that as you advance through your cultivation, the body is enriched as well as the core. In that process, how does it affect cell division? Would it elongate the duration?\"\n\n\"That is an interesting hypothesis, Jean. I haven't looked into it. If you are interested in it, I encourage you to pursue this line of questioning. If you can share your findings with all of us, that would be even better!\" Guy answered.\n\nRight as he finished the sentence, he noticed Jean entering some form of an excited stupor. Although her face didn't show it, Guy could feel the perturbations inside her.\n\nAll of a sudden, right as her aura started to settle, Guy felt a slight rush of mana circulating within him. It only lasted for a brief moment, but it was enough for Guy to understand the underlying effect.\n\n'It's like... I'm cultivating?!' He exclaimed to himself.\n\nIt was almost the same kind of feeling Guy - the one before the transmigration - used to feel when he cultivated his Way of the Burning Fist, barring a few differences in the mana circulation. Furthermore, as Guy wracked his mind, he realised he had experienced the same feeling when he was under the \"other guy's\" influence in trying to elucidate Markus. At that time, his mind wasn't focused on that feeling. He sort of just let it flow through him naturally that time.\n\n'It's feedback! My cultivation is based on the feedback I get when my students grasp insights through my |Soul Imprint|!' Guy hypothesised. Along those lines, Guy also noticed that the feedback he received in enlightening Jean was far inferior to his session with Markus. This could be indicative of two factors. First, the insights transmitted and grasped through the use of the mask and the \"other guy\" were superior to his current method. Second, the breadth of advancement could affect the amount of feedback Guy would receive through the |Soul Imprint|.\n\nTo the latter, it could be that advancing between realms would offer greater feedback than minor insight absorption. Furthermore, the difference between Guy and the student could also affect the amount. For instance, at that time Markus and Guy were in the same realm. When Guy performed his |Soul Imprint| and helped Markus achieve a breakthrough to perfect resonance, the feedback was amplified. But now, since Jean was barely within Early stage Mana Condensation realm, and Guy was already in the Base stage Foundation Establishment realm, the separation was too vast.\n\nOf course, all of this was just speculation on Guy's part for the time being. He was looking forward to testing his hypothesis further to figure out the kinks of his self-made \"system\".\n\nAfter a short pause, Guy spoke up, \"Let's move to the second location. Everyone, back to the school bus!\"\n\n____\n\nThe next stop took the group to a place inside the body. The ambience was markedly darker, and the only source of light that illuminated the area were the unusually bright headlights of the school bus. The walls of the area would undulate, expand and contract, and had a pinkish-red and sticky coating.\n\n\"How much longer, Master?\" Markus asked. They had been here for quite some time now, and the two were feeling a little antsy and claustrophobic.\n\nFor a minute, Guy didn't answer. His face contorted with an embarrassed expression, before settling with a wry smile. He would have loved to take the students out of the bus, but this part of the trip had been recreated not from experience, rather from recollection. The environment wouldn't be as realistic as before and it would seriously detract from their learning experience. Furthermore, the scenario Guy had envisioned to recreate was a bit...\n\nAll of a sudden, the entire area started to jerk back and forth.\n\n\"\"WOAH!\"\" The students exclaimed. \"Wear your seatbelts and hold on tight you two!\" Guy reminded. Thankfully, the school bus was somehow thoroughly fastened to the walls of the chamber.\n\nThe back and forth jerking motion didn't subside, in fact, it started to grow increasingly vigorous.\n\n\"M-Master, what is happening?\"\n\nThen, with a large, forceful crash, the jerking motion stopped. As it did, the group suddenly saw a milky-white viscous fluid flooding into the room. Upon closer inspection, the students observed a horde of strange-looking tadpole-like creatures swimming through. They had an oval, translucent head and a lean, rapidly serpentining tail. \n\nJean was the first to notice a few similarities between those tadpoles and the skin cells she'd seen earlier.\n\n\"Are those cells too?\" She asked Guy, to which he nodded. \"What kind of cells are those?\" She evoked in a low volume.\n\nGuy didn't answer and just called the school bus into action to follow the swimming horde. At the end of the chamber, the swimming group split in two. Through a strange intuition, Guy chose to follow the group that split to the right and moved with them through a narrow tunnel.\n\nAfter a short ride, the bus turned around a bend and came face to face with a massive cell. It was many times larger than the swimming cells and the skin cells the group had seen before.\n\n\"What is this cell?\" Jean vocalised. \n\nThe bus had overtaken the swimmers while moving through the tunnel. Just a few seconds later, the horde lagging behind them burst around the bend and rushed towards the massive cell.\n\n\"What are the-\" Before Jean could finish, the swimmers dove headfirst through the membrane of the cell. \"They're eating it!\"\n\n\"W-We need to save it!\" Jean exclaimed, forgetting that everything around her was just an illusion.\n\nWithin seconds, one of the leading swimmers managed to eat its way towards the nucleus of the larger cell and merged with it. As it did so, the membrane of the larger cell started to turn visible tighter, disallowing any other interlopers from breaching through. The ones that did manage to gain entry apart from the one that merged slowly died away and were ejected.\n\n\"\"What just happened?\"\" Markus and Jean asked.\n\n\"I was hoping to show Meiosis, but...\" Guy finally answered with heavy dread and embarrassment in his voice.\n\nHis two students looked at him with a confused expression. To them, the event that transpired was just like if a bucket of chum was dropped into a lake filled with fish. It was a legitimate feeding frenzy!\n\n\"Let's follow this one,\" Guy added and turned the bus to shadow the floating large cell as it traversed back through the tunnel. Along the way, they noticed a few \"corpses\" of the dead swimmers.\n\nThe large cell floated through the tunnel and finally attached itself to the wall of the larger chamber they were in before.\n\nLittle by little, the cell started to divide and multiply.\n\n\"They don't seem to be dying as quickly,\" Jean commented. \"What exactly are these cells.\"\n\n\"It's a zygote. Do you remember what a zygote is?\" Guy inquired.\n\nJean narrowed her eyes slightly as she worked her memory. Suddenly, the information flooded her mind.\n\n\"A zygote? T-then what happened before....\" Jean's face started to turn a sharp shade of crimson as the realisation struck her like a rogue carriage.\n\n\"What about what happened before?\" Markus inquired. \"Jean! Your face! It's turning red again! Are you sick?\" Markus instinctively reached forward and placed the back of his palm on the girl's forehead.\n\nJean quickly ducked and dodged the approaching hand and scooted further into the seat, towards the window, and turned her head away in embarrassment.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Markus muttered. But then his eyes looked out and he gazed at the rapidly growing cell cluster. It started as a shapeless blob, and then quickly started to gain some clarity. First, the cluster turned into a bean-like shape, with one arc growing larger and larger. From the lower arc, noodle-like extensions started to grow out. These extensions started to become more defined and looked like appendages over time. Right as the upper arc formed a distinct face, Markus' mouth opened wide in surprise.\n\n\"It's a baby? Aaaaaa... Wait! So then what happened before...\" It was now Markus' turn to colour himself crimson, as he receded into his jacket.\n\nWhile this was happening, Guy started receiving a small amount of feedback in the form of cultivation. However, he couldn't enjoy it, as he shoved his face into his hands in embarrassment.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-113]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":106,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 111 - Mini Field Trip","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\"Good morning you two! Where's Marie?\"\n\n\"Good morning Teacher Larks,\" Jean answered. \"Big Sis appeared a little checked out today. I don't think she will be attending.\"\n\n\"Should I go fetch her, Master?\" Markus declared with a serious frown as he leapt up from his seat.\n\nGuy shook his head while smiling and said, \"That's okay. She's probably tired or burnt out. She'll come when she's ready.\"\n\n\"It's actually for the best since I wanted to test a few hypotheses out today and was worried that it would alienate her,\" Guy added immediately after.\n\n\"Is it about what happened yesterday, Master? That place again?\" Markus probed.\n\nRight as Guy nodded, Markus instructed Jean to follow him and sat down on the ground in the lotus position. Guy didn't even need to instruct them before they entered a steady state of meditation. With a satisfied smile, Guy followed the two and proceeded to move through his meditative stances, in order to reenter The Church.\n\nAlthough Guy could very easily access that place using the mask, he wanted to maintain caution. The Church was a wild-card. It was only through gruelling introspection that Guy obtained safe passage into it. He planned to thoroughly explore the nuances of this mysterious space and unearth all of its secrets before relying on the mask. Guy wasn't planning to drop the mask altogether, though. He knew that to present the more abstract and out of the way concepts to his students, he would have to rely on the \"other Guy\". However, he'd prefer to delay this till absolutely necessary.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Guy found himself once again in his core space. He then retraced his steps and entered through the film-like pool at the centre of the room, and entered The Church. The ambience hadn't changed much since he'd last accessed this place. He walked over to corporeal forms of Markus and Jean and brought them into The Church by grabbing them.\n\n\"Master!\" \"Teacher Larks!\" The two exclaimed in unison.\n\nGuy noticed that Jean's presence was much clearer than last time.\n\n\"How is it now, Jean?\"\n\n\"It's better. It isn't as choppy as yesterday.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful! I've brought you two here to evaluate something,\" Guy started. \"If you remember, last time we left off, we were covering the topic on cells. Can one of you tell me the definition of a cell?\"\n\nJean was the first to respond, \"The basic building block of life, that is a cell.\"\n\n\"Good. So as you know, every living organism is made up of cells. We've seen how these cells work using the |Magnification| cantrip as well as the |Inspect| cantrip. Today, I want us to dig deeper and actually observe the various processes a cell can undertake.\"\n\nGuy was confident that he could present this topic through the power of The Church because he vividly remembered his Bio lab-sessions from school. As a scion from a rich family, Guy had the privilege to study in a private academy with top of the line lab equipment. Through it, Guy received an in-depth understanding of the topic, and he was confident in his ability to recollect this information in its entirety.\n\nHis students prepared themselves for whatever was about to come. Guy concentrated inwards and drew out his clearest memory pertaining to the topic. As he did so, a black screen materialised at the dais. Markus was familiar with this visual, he was shown the same right when he received the revelation about the black hole.\n\n\"Prepare yourself, Jean! You will be subject to a lot of information and stimulus at once. Keep yourself calm at all times and absorb everything in pace,\" Markus warned as he started to circulate his mana and calm his mind. Jean's blank face narrowed slightly as she took her Senior Brother's advice to heart. She too started to circulate her mana accordingly and entered a deeper meditation.\n\nThe black screen grew up to a point and halted abruptly. All of a sudden, the students found themselves getting sucked forward into the screen. After a disorienting bout of transition, the two jerked to a halt and felt a sense of weightlessness. They were floating through some sort of fluid that felt a bit viscous, but they didn't feel suffocated or restricted. They could see clearly around them and could move around by mimicking a simple swimming motion.\n\n\"Where is this?\" Jean was the first to voice her concern.\n\n\"I'm not sure. But the place does look a bit familiar...\" Markus responded. He started spinning around and tried to situate himself. He gazed into the distance and noticed many weird looking particles floating around. These particles also looked familiar somehow...\n\nAll of a sudden, a moving object caught his eye. It looked distant but was also quickly approaching them. As it grew larger, Markus made out its yellow colour and weird box-like shape. Once the distance was shortened further, he realised that it was a machine, given its metallic shell. It had two globular bulges up front that were illuminated, they somewhat resembled a pair of eyes because of the presence of a wobbling black ball within them. It had four round, black wheels, two up front and two behind.\n\n\"It's some sort of a vehicle?\" Markus muttered.\n\n\"What is it, Senior Brother?\"\n\n\"Look over there,\" Markus replied as he pointed towards the approaching object.\n\nThe yellow vehicle came at them at a high-speed but quickly started to decelerate once it drew closer. It stopped right in front of the two and a windowed door at the side opened up magically.\n\n\"Get in, you guys!\" Guy's voice called out from inside the box.\n\nHearing their Teacher's, familiar, shout the two students swam in without hesitation.\n\n\"Master!\" \"Teacher!\"\n\n\"Take a seat up back!\" Guy said while tilting his head out from the driver's seat.\n\n\"Seatbelts everyone!\" He added with a nostalgic chuckle\n\n\"What are those?\" Markus replied, interrupting Guy's mirth.\n\n\"*cough* Umm, it's those flat ropes attached to the seats. Follow the sign on the seat in front of you on how to wear them. It's for your safety.\"\n\n\"Teacher Larks. What is this carriage?\" Jean asked\n\n\"It's a bus. It's used to transport a lot of people at once. This bus in particular is called a school bus. It's used to transport kids living in a neighbourhood to the school.\"\n\n\"That's amazing! How does it work?\"\n\n\"Usually it works with an engine. Think of it like a mechanical heart that pumps energy! But this one... This one works with magic!\" Guy answered while wearing a mysterious smile.\n\n\"Hold on to your seat class, we're going on a field trip!\" Right as Guy finished, the vehicle lurched forward and zoomed forth into the distance.\n\n\"If you remember from last time, in multicellular organisms such as plants, animals and fungi the cells that make them up constantly grow and divide. This is how life is sustained. So can you tell me what are the two main ways cell division takes place?\"\n\n\"Mitosis and Meiosis,\" Jean answered instantaneously. \"Mitosis is when a cell makes an exact copy of itself before dividing into two, while Meiosis is when a cell creates a half copy of itself.\"\n\n\"Can you elaborate on what is meant by a half copy?\"\n\n\"Ummm... It's to do with the chromosomes in the cell's nucleus,\" Jean responded with some uncertainty.\n\n\"That is correct. A cell's nucleus contains chromosomes are DNA molecules that hold the genetic material of the organism and directive on how the cell works. When a half copy, as you say, is created then the copy of the cell only contains partial amounts of the chromosomes of the original cell. Can you tell me where Meiosis might occur?\"\n\nJean's face turned crimson as she replied with a low mutter, \"S-sex cells...\"\n\n\"That is also correct! Sex cells, or gametes, are special because they only contain half of the total required chromosomes to sustain Mitosis. Two gametes merge together through a process known as fertilisation to produce a whole cell or zygote, that can undergo Mitosis. And that is how children are born!\"\n\n\"Today, we will observe these two types of cell division more closely!\"\n\n____\n\nThe quality and precision of experience provided through Guy's method are dependent on how well and deeply Guy understands what he intends to present. So in this case, because Guy has an intimate understanding of the cell functionalities, he can recreate this mechanism to a high degree of realism. To add some additional \"Oomph!\" to these visuals, Guy decided to wrap the information in a fun package that followed a gimmick from one of Guy's favourite educational cartoons during his childhood. \n\nSince the realism of this package wasn't of tantamount importance, certain details could be overlooked. For instance, Guy drove the school bus with inane familiarity. It wasn't excessively difficult, he just had to indicate through intention where he wanted to go, and the bus automatically moved according to his will. To play along, though, Guy opted to twist and turn the steering wheel in fake harmony with the bus.\n\nAfter a short while, the bus arrived at a rather barren plane where strands of wavy outcropping rose from pores in the ground and extended upwards into a fine point. The students initially assumed that the place was some sort of a weird-looking forest. But as Markus observed the scene more closely, he managed to make an intellectual connection.\n\n\"It's the skin!\" He exclaimed.\n\n\"Good job! It's exactly right. We are currently on the surface of a human's skin,\" Guy replied while bringing the bus to a stable halt. He opened the doors and allowed the students to step out.\n\nOnce Markus exited the vehicle, he bent down and started to feel the flaking surface more carefully. Slowly, a frown started to show on his face.\n\n\"What's wrong, Markus?\" Guy inquired.\n\n\"I don't know. It's just... this all feels different from the last time,\" Markus replied.\n\n\"Of course! The visual you experienced previously was in outer space,\" Guy said.\n\n\"Not that! That last time, it all felt so real to me. The atmosphere, the feedback in my senses, it didn't feel jarring...\"\n\n\"It does now?\" Guy asked with furrowed brows.\n\n\"Well not exactly. It just feels less real somehow. I don't know what's making me feel this way,\" Markus explained with some difficulty. \"It's just instinctual, I guess. It's like what you said a few months back when you were discussing Puppetry and Mechanics with Teacher Jeeves. I believe you called it the Uncanny Valley, Master?\"\n\nBut Guy understood the boy's point. Although Guy knew enough about cell processes, replicating the human skin to such a level of accuracy with all that it contains wasn't within his wheelhouse. So some estimations were made that would definitely pull one out of the immersion if examined properly. With regards to how this was perceived, it was like when someone who's been playing games at 144Hz is forced to play the same game at 30Hz. Although the output is the same, the drop in quality cannot go unnoticed.\n\nGuy smiled bitterly at the realisation that his other counterpart was better at creating such lifelike simulations than he was. Even when the simulation was something Guy recollected from his past experiences.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-112]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":107,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 110 - The Church's Secrets","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nGuy retreated his head out of the pool and reentered multiple times to confirm that his sight was true and not an illusion like before. He even extended his hand in and felt the immediate vicinity. It all felt real enough to him. Maybe it was an elaborate illusion, however, it was far too advanced for him to confirm it.\n\nAs a child, Guy often wondered how the television worked. How was it possible to get such elaborate visuals compressed inside a small metal box with a window in it? One possible theory he had was that there were small people inside the box enacting and playing things out. But that warranted the question: how was the box able to hold so many different people? Where did they sleep? What did they eat? Did they leave the box after the work was finished?\n\nAnyways, for a moment, Guy felt like one of those small people living inside the television. This was because the place where he peeked out from and into The Church happened to be the exact same place where the visuals surrounding the black hole were being played out for Markus to see.\n\n\"Could it be that the images and visuals shown to Markus originated from my core space?\"\n\nIt was a valid hypothesis. The elusive mist that persisted within his core space upon his initial entry could create extremely lifelike illusions. It could also go as far as highjacking the five human senses. Maybe, the mist from before replicated the singularity through Guy's memories of watching various documentaries and projected it for Markus. Furthermore, Markus expressed that he felt as if he was pulled into the vision; he felt as if he was personally experiencing the event. This could mean that Markus was extracted into Guy's core space!\n\n\"So my core is basically a FIVR (Full-Immersion Virtual Reality) chamber,\" Guy muttered with an awkward smile.\n\nIt would be a revolutionary phenomenon if that were true! Because the process in and of itself was completely different from |Soul Imprint| and definitely more effective. Based on Al's explanation, |Soul Imprint| is limited by the fact that it can only transfer insights and information that the user has personally witnessed or experienced. No lie, deception, or misrepresentation can be transmitted through a |Soul Imprint|. So essentially, it would have been impossible for Guy to imprint intimate knowledge of a black hole into his student.\n\nAs he grew increasingly excited at the prospect of developing an ultimate cheat-like ability, another theory started to gnaw away at him.\n\n\"What if... 'I' believed it so vehemently, that 'I' perceived it to be 'my' truth!\" Guy surmised. By \"I\", Guy was referring to his other personality. The man he now dubbed as the \"other guy\", no pun intended.\n\n\"It could also be possible that the 'other guy' was so involved in the knowledge that he created a false experience through sheer force of will!\"\n\nIf that was the case, then the technique would still be classified as |Soul Imprint| yet with an expanded scope. For one, the revelations Guy's incarnation of the technique provided were far more realistic and involved. It was also possible to tweak the way the information is transmitted with Guy's method. The general application of the |Soul Imprint| technique simply planted the packets of knowledge into the recipient's mind. However, Guy's |Soul Imprint| encouraged the target to personally witness the information and formulate their own insights. In essence, this negates the possibility of mental contamination in the recipient by separating the transferrer's personal biases and opinions from the knowledge.\n\nSecondly, if Guy's assumption was true, then having the extremely delusional \"other guy\" steering the |Soul Imprint| procedure could allow him to transmit information that he hasn't personally experienced. This meant that he could even transmit abstract and unfamiliar concepts such as quantum physics, viral mutations, and complex numbers, to his students.\n\n\"All that aside. What does this all mean about my cultivation?\"\n\nThat was the question Guy wanted answers to in the first place. The only reason he dared to access his core through |Introspect| was to take a closer look at his cultivation method. Guy knew for a fact that he hadn't been following any particular cultivation method, so then how did he manage to break through into a higher realm?\n\nAt this point, Guy had fully entered The Church and assumed a seat at the back of the dais. He noticed that at the benches, there were three more faint corporeal figures next to Markus. Right after Markus was an extremely faint and misty form of Kano. After him, there were the equally faint forms of Jean, followed by Dora.\n\n\"It's the order in which they truly recognised me as a Teacher with great influence in their lives,\" Guy concluded.\n\nHe approached Markus' figure and inspected it curiously. When he had assumed the persona of the \"other guy\", he acted very familiarly and with practiced motions. Everything just seemed instinctual to him. But that wasn't right! Working through instinct is fine when it comes to sports. But with pedagogy and science, one cannot ride through with unexplained theories.\n\nGuy remembered that to enter Markus' core space, he had grasped at the rope extending from the corporeal figure's navel. Following the same method, Guy reached forward and grabbed the rope tight.\n\nInstantaneously, he could feel a strong suction followed by a familiar disorienting traversal. But unlike before, his motion was cut short and he was pulled back. Immediately, Guy found himself back where he was in The Church.\n\nGuy frowned and tried again, only to face the same rejection. Seeing as there wasn't an adverse reaction, he kept trying a few more times.\n\n\"Is it because I am not wearing the mask?\" He muttered as he grasped the rope one last time. Unlike before, though, this time his trip followed through and he found himself in the dark environment from before.\n\n\"Why did it work this time? Do I have to keep repeating it multiple times for it to succeed?\"\n\nGuy returned to The Church and tried the alternate strategy of pulling Markus in. He grasped the boy's corporeal figure, causing the inanimate form to liven up.\n\n\"Master, you called me?\" The boy's figure vocalised.\n\n\"Huh? Why did it work the first time?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure what you mean, Master.\"\n\n\"I was trying to access your core before. I had to repeat it multiple times before succeeding. However, the process of pulling you into my core space worked right away.\"\n\n\"Oh. Actually, before, I experienced a nagging feeling. I didn't know what it was; I thought it had something to do with my cultivation. It kept repeating so I sat down to meditate. As I did so, this suddenly happened.\"\n\n\"So it's through meditation!\"\n\n\"Is there anything you need, Master?\" Markus' figure asked.\n\n\"Hmm... Not really. Wait-\" Guy quickly interrupted. \"Can you try moving around here?\"\n\nMarkus' figure frowned for a while before speaking up, \"I can't seem to move. Where is this place exactly?\"\n\n\"That's also what I'm trying to figure out. Can you go and ask Jean to meditate with you as well?\" Guy instructed. After hearing Markus' affirmation, Guy dismissed him. To release him, Guy mentally urged Markus to exit his meditative state.\n\nAfter waiting for a sufficient duration, Guy repeated the invitation process and grasped Markus.\n\n\"Master!\" The boy's figure exclaimed.\n\nGuy moved over to Jean and did the same. However, since her figure wasn't as clear as Markus', her reaction after entering The Church was choppy and blurred.\n\n\"T..cher La..ks!\" The girlcalled out. Her figure fidgeted and flickered.\n\n\"Jean, can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Y.., I ..n!\" A hazy reply followed.\n\n\"Can you look around? What do you see?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"It's bl..ry I ..n't s.. a..y..ing,\" She answered.\n\nGuy hummed and then proceeded to dismiss his two students once again.\n\nAlthough the method wasn't properly scientific, the interaction had yielded Guy a lot of valuable information. It was still in need of further testing, but Guy could surmise that The Church's range wasn't limited to his immediate vicinity and that he could utilise it to interact with his students spiritually as long as the two parties were meditating. This was insane!\n\n\"It has a conference call feature!\" Or as the \"other guy\" would put it: \"remote sermon feature.\" There was still some need for stress-testing the boundaries of this feature, but as it stood it was definitely game-breaking.\n\nIn addition to this, Guy figured that the student's cultivation realm could also play a key role in the effectiveness of this feature. For one, the distance that can be covered could be limited by the cultivation realm of the recipient. After all, Markus was close to Foundation Establishment while Jean had just started her journey. It could also affect the clarity of the recipient's presence in The Church. Maybe Jean could have a better visual if she was of a higher realm?\n\n\"All of these warrant thorough experimentations, however, I am sorely lacking a sufficiently large testing batch to do so,\" Guy commented with a bitter expression.\n\nGuy could possibly accumulate a few more students from the village, however, most of them at the school-going age were too young to walk the path of magehood. And, Guy couldn't think of a plausible ground to influence their lives enough, such that the RoK recognises them.\n\nHe could just as easily go around recruiting random folks and teaching them magic, but that wasn't Guy's mantra.\n\n\"I'll just have to make do with what I have...\"\n\nYet, all things considered, there was still one question of Guy's that had gone unanswered. How were The Church and the white room at his core space related to his cultivation?\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-111]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":108,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 109 - Nostalgia","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nGuy remembered this place. It was a place most familiar, and personal, to him. It was his studio apartment from his previous life!\n\nThe room itself was minimalistic and condensed, roughly 60 square metres by Guy's estimate. However, to him, it was more than enough. There was a comfortable twin bed, a kitchen, a couch, and television, what more could he ask for?\n\nGuy took a deep breath and was greeted by the familiar smell of home.\n\n\"Why is it here though?\" Guy muttered to himself. He paced around the area and inspected his surroundings. Although it had only been a little over a year since his arrival into this world, he had a perfect memory of this dwelling. To his surprise, the replica within his so-called core was faithfully accurate in its representation, down to the unique way in which he folded the corners of his bedspread.\n\nA nostalgic sigh escaped Guy's mouth as a plethora of emotions swelled up within him.\n\n\"Mast? Can you hear me?\" Guy yelled out loud, only to face silence in response. Either Mast was willfully ignoring Guy, or Mast couldn't hear him at all. Usually, Mast never failed to answer Guy's calls, since their conversations were usually well spaced, so it had to be the latter case. \n\nWhile at Guy's realm, the core was close to becoming a physical construct, it was primarily an abstract existence. The way Guy accessed this place was through |Introspect|, a spell that forced him to look within himself. This shouldn't be out of Mast's range of purview since he could communicate with Guy while he was in the RoK, which according to Mast was also an existence tethered to Guy's soul.\n\nSo why couldn't Mast hear him now?\n\nAfter a short bout of contemplation, Guy found himself getting drawn towards his familiar surroundings. Subconsciously, Guy walked over to his kitchen and opened the refrigerator. As he did so, he saw various stacks of packaged and labelled Tupperware filled to the brim with cooked food items. The handwriting on the label was familiar to him, \"It's Mom's!\"\n\nWith sparkling eyes, Guy hastily pulled out all the containers and popped them open. While cold, the aroma of the various cuisines assaulted his senses. Overwhelmed with nostalgia, Guy's eyes started to well up with excitement and sorrow. Guy quickly shoved a container of fried rice into the Microwave and heated it. As he did so, he pulled out a spoon and dug into the container of homemade ice cream.\n\n\"Mmmm,\" Guy moaned with pleasure as the frigid, creamy substance melted on his tongue and slid down the back of his throat. The sweetness from the natural mango flavouring danced a while longer in his mouth before dissipating with the coldness. Without pause, Guy dug the spoon deep and shoved another spoonful into his mouth. Another elongated moan emanated as he processed the nostalgic taste once again.\n\nBy the time the fried rice had heated up, Guy had nearly mowed through the entire ice cream container. Surprisingly, Guy didn't feel full at all. Guy washed his mouth to clear his palate and dug into the container of fried rice. The rice had dried a little due to the reheating, however, the taste hadn't diminished significantly. Smiling like an excited 5-year-old, Guy shovelled spoonfuls of the rice into his mouth.\n\nThe container of fried rice was finished within half an hour. But Guy didn't feel full just yet. He scanned over the other containers and picked the next food item of his choosing. His mother absolutely loved to cook. She had travelled all over the world and studied under various renowned chefs - professionals at the top of their games - and learned a plethora of cuisines. In his childhood, Guy never once ate out. His breakfast, lunch and dinner were all cooked by his mother. Guy also recollected a few pleasant memories of him and his mother working together in the kitchen. All though Guy wasn't as gifted in the culinary arts, he was sufficiently skilful in handling the knife. So in the kitchen, by default, it was his responsibility to prepare and cut the vegetables and meat, while his mother handled the intricate stages.\n\nThus, Guy was faced with a dilemma as to his second choice of containers. Each held a meal from a different cuisine. There was Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Italian, English, Arabic, Mediterranean, and Mexican. Guy gulped down a mouthful of saliva. He was suddenly feeling gluttonous! He decided that he would finish all of them!\n\nOne after another, food entered and exited the microwave and travelled down Guy's gullet. Within the next hour, Guy had completely cleaned up all the containers. After shoving the last morsel of food into his mouth, Guy exhaled with satisfaction. After resting for a few minutes, he got up and started to wash the dishes. After placing them to dry, Guy walked up to his refrigerator to retrieve a bottle of water.\n\nHowever, when he opened the door, his eyes widened in shock.\n\n\"T-They're back?\" The containers that he had just cleaned up had returned to their original places and were magically refilled with a new combination of food items!\n\nGuy looked back at the drying rack and noticed that the containers he had placed there had gone too. \"But how?\" He muttered in disbelief.\n\nIt was at that moment that an epiphany struck him. For a brief moment, Guy had forgotten that he had even died and transmigrated. The feeling of home, the taste of his mother's food - Guy had become hypnotised by the sensory overload of familiarity.\n\n\"This isn't real!\" Guy declared in part to affirm his conclusion and also to remind his subconscious. This place wasn't home, it was only a replica. Once this thought solidified in his mind, Guy started to notice the various peculiarities in his surroundings. First off, the time on the clock hanging above the television was acting weirdly. It would start spinning haphazardly one moment, and in another, it would just freeze. The pictures on the wall! Guy clearly remembered hanging a few frames around his home, however, they were now mysteriously gone. The only picture Guy saw was his family portrait.\n\nGuy approached the shelf next to the television and picked up the palm-sized picture frame. In it, he could clearly see the seated figures of his parents, as well as his siblings flanking them from behind. However, the faces on the portrait were missing!\n\n\"What is this place?!\" Guy blurted in confusion.\n\nAs Guy started to become more receptive to his surroundings, his surroundings in turn started to fluctuate and flicker.\n\n\"Is this an illusion?\" Guy commented out loud.\n\n(C.. .ou h.ar .e?) A recognisable voice pierced through the undulating scenery.\n\n\"Mast?\"\n\n(Hey! Can you hear me?) Mast repeated.\n\n\"Mast!\" Guy called out. As he did so, the facade around him finally collapsed, dissipating into a white mist. After the fog settled, Guy found himself in a white, uniform, cubic room. At the centre of the room, was a cubic recession containing a perfectly flat reflective surface. The mist gradually thinned out and disappeared completely.\n\n\"How long was I out for?\" Guy asked Mast. This time, an answer arrived, (A few minutes. What happened?)\n\n\"I don't know for sure. I think I was caught in some sort of an illusion.\"\n\n(Your mind had turned completely dormant and inert for a moment there. You got me concerned for a second. Be careful,) Mast reminded.\n\nGuy hummed to himself and cautiously approached the square recession at the centre of the room. By making a few mental connections, Guy could deduce that the reflective surface or pool was most likely his core. He had seen something similar when he entered Markus' core region the last time. However, he also remembered the danger Al had faced by carelessly messing around with it, so Guy kept himself on edge in case he needed to make a break for it.\n\nAs he approached it, Guy didn't notice anything suspicious or dangerous transpiring, everything was calm and peachy. The tranquillity persisted till Guy was right at the bank of the reflective pool.\n\nGuy started to take long, measured breaths to calm himself. Although he recognised the possible threat, he was kind of suspicious about what lay within his core. He kneeled forward and stationed his arms firmly near the bank, and leaned closer. As his face drew near the pool's surface, Guy was hit with another shocking revelation.\n\n\"M-My face!\" The reflection on the pool wasn't of Guy's current face, that is the face of the body he was currently inhabiting. No! It was his face from his past life.\n\nGuy moved his hands around his face, he pulled and pinched his cheeks, he opened and closed his mouth, he even grasped and yanked his hair. Whatever he did to his body, the reflection repeated down to the minute details. Guy was once again washed over by a nostalgic feeling. He really missed his old face. Compared to his current one it was vastly superior! Guy suspected that he could have easily achieved greater success in this life if only he had his previous, impeccably chiselled face.\n\nGuy exhaled and revealed a bitter smile. He really wanted to admire his face for a bit longer, however, his curiosity was killing him!\n\nHe brought his fingers towards the surface of the unwavering pool - so did his reflection. Right as their fingers touched each other, Guy suddenly felt a light opposition. Guy frowned slightly and started to push harder by a small percentage. Right as he did so, his fingers slid through, cutting through the surface tension. Interestingly, his intrusion didn't cause even a ripple. The hand moved through as if it were passing through a permeable film.\n\nAfter leaving his had submerged into the pool for a while, Guy pulled it out and inspected it thoroughly. Only after making sure that nothing had gone awry, did he slightly let down his guard.\n\n\"Seems as though it's safe enough,\" Guy concluded.\n\nNext, Guy decided to peek in only with his head. Although his entire body could be submerged into the pool, he wanted to maintain his alertness.\n\nAfter taking a deep breath, Guy sank his head into the pool.\n\nWithout a splash, his face dipped through the filmlike surface and peeked out the other side. Guy had subconsciously closed his eyes during this process, after all, it was a natural human reaction. Upon detecting that he had passed through, he slowly peeled open his eyes.\n\nJust as they gained clarity, Guy quickly rubbed them again to do a double-take. This was because what lay before him, was not at all foreign to him. In fact, he had been in this place a few times already, albeit in a \"different frame of mind\".\n\nGuy's mouth sprang agape as he absorbed his surroundings once again.\n\n\"It's The Church!\" He exclaimed.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-110]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":109,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 108 - Learning to |Introspect|","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nRecently, Guy stumbled upon an interesting discovery while teaching Yoga to Dora. He didn't notice it at first because he was so concentrated on instructing her, though it became more apparent as he repeated the stances by himself for the purpose of meditation.\n\nInterestingly, Yoga could double as the orthodox meditation method used in this world to replenish mana and centre one's mind prior to cultivation. In fact, it happened to have a stacking effect as he transitioned through different poses. After a few tests, Guy found that the increase was geometric in that the rate doubled with each new pose added to the sequence.\n\nHowever, with every new pose, while the rate doubled, it wasn't a discrete jump, it was parabolic. Therefore, after a point, the rate would plateau and would start to diminish eventually. Guy found that if he transitioned to another pose at the plateau he could reactivate the parabolic trend and maintain the momentum.\n\nThe reason for this happened to be how the various poses motivated the flow of mana through his mana channels. As previously established, meditation is the easiest strategy for a mage to replenish their mana. But why is that?\n\nMages cast spells by channelling the mana stored in their cores. They cannot channel the ambient mana in its unprocessed, raw form. If they try to do so, they may damage their mana channels, sometimes irreversibly. Therefore, the mage must first direct the ambient mana through their core, which purifies it, before piping it through their mana channels. But how can they get the ambient mana to enter their cores?\n\nThere are many ways for a mage to achieve this. Natural osmosis of mana through skin, flesh and muscles is possible, but it is unbearably slow. One could also directly inject a large infusion of mana right where the core is through some sort of a piercing device. Although efficient, it would be painful and potentially dangerous. Alternatively, they could ingest mana-enriched food and extract the mana from their stomachs. \n\nBut the most common strategy is to let the mana reach the core through the naturally existing blood vessels. Essentially, the human ingests ambient mana via inhalation, lets it piggyback on the blood cells flowing through the lungs, through the heart, and then directly to their cores.\n\nMeditation is the preferred method to supplement this process. By consciously channelling mana throughout the body, through the plethora of channels off-shooting from the core, a sort of vacuum is created in the core. This in turn pulls more mana from the blood flowing in the vessels thus increasing the passive ingestion of mana by inhalation, and decreasing the rejected mana through exhalation.\n\nTo optimise the mana influx, the mage needs to channel their internal mana through all the blood vessels exiting the core. This process is time-consuming and takes years of experimentation to perfect, as no two mages have the same mana channel configuration.\n\nHowever, Yoga seemed to make it almost trivial. Each pose happened to excite mana flow through one set of mana channels. After exhausting those channels, the practitioner simply moves to the next pose that excites a different set of channels. This process is continued till either all possible sets are exhausted, or the mage no longer feels the need to replenish mana.\n\nThere were, however, some caveats to this. For instance, there were cases when two poses happened to excite similar or intersecting sets of channels. In those cases, the rate was greatly nerfed. Guy had to experiment through a bunch of different poses both from memory and from the reference books in the RoK until he put together the optimal Yoga sequence for himself.\n\nOn top of this, Guy also found out that the sets determined as optimal for him weren't necessarily so for others. Markus and Jean, for example, couldn't enjoy the same rate increase from following Guy's sequence. Instead, Guy had to fashion a different sequence of poses for his students to achieve the same result.\n\nApart from the benefits of mana replenishment, Yoga also offered an insane boost in concentration the longer Guy practised it. Surprisingly, this concentration boost also stacked which turned out to be both a boon and a curse. Guy realised that there was an optimal amount of concentration someone could have before it simply turned into tunnel vision.\n\nThis secondary benefit was of immense use to Dora, who struggled with centring herself, but for others, with an already sharp sense of focus, it just made them more intense. One time, Guy forgot to pace his meditation and ended up fixating on his breath. Through it, he figured out that his every sixth breath, and every twelfth breath after that was elongated by an eighth of a second. He also found out that he flared his nostrils during exhalation three per cent more than during inhalation.\n\nThe worst part about this heightened state of concentration was that its duration also compounded. In the previous case, Guy was stuck measuring his breath for almost five hours!\n\nUltimately, Guy determined the sweet spot and found that intermittently diverting his focus to another focal point when practising a pose offered sufficient disruption to hamper the compounding without sacrificing the growth in mana replenishment rate. The diversion couldn't be too drastic, nor could it be so negligible as to not make a difference.\n\nWith all that being said, why was Guy still focusing so intensely during his meditation at the moment, one may wonder?\n\nWell, after a rather fruitful discussion with Al, he had learned that as a mage in the Foundation Establishment, he could now train himself to personally inspect his core. To do this, he would need to dip his toes into a rather arcane subsection of magehood - spirituality.\n\nAccording to Al, although it is possible for a mage to gauge their and others' cultivations at a superficial level, one can't truly view the entire picture without delving deeper through spirituality. Spirituality also has other functionalities as one advances through it, however, due to its difficulty it is often sidelined in favour of processes of immediate concern. Nevertheless, every mage MUST learn one important skill from the spirituality toolbox, and that's |Introspect|.\n\n|Introspect| is the spiritual counterpart of the ubiquitous |Inspect| cantrip. To elaborate on that abstruse definition, while |Inspect| offers insight into the physical nature of things, |Introspect| offers insight into the abstract realms of reality. How do particles interact? One can observe it through |Inspect|. How do two opposing world views affect a person's growth? This is where one could use |Introspect|. In simpler terms, the skill |Introspect| could make all psychologists' and most psychiatrists' lives immensely easier.\n\nIn the beginning |Introspect| is a skill solely to be used to gaze into oneself. It is mostly used by mages to aid their cultivation path to ensure that nothing goes haphazardly wrong when they absorb insights. Through practice and experience, one can learn to extend this skill towards targets aside from themselves. This external application is hence called |Extrospect|. This was the same skill used by Al to peer into Markus' cultivation.\n\nNeedless to say, |Introspect| wasn't an easy skill to grasp. To approach it, one must first clear their minds from all distractions and direct their concentration on their deepest and most repressed thoughts.\n\nThat was it! No matter how hard Guy searched, he couldn't find a more substantial methodology.\n\n'Again with the abstract explanations...' Guy sighed exasperatedly at that time. 'It's like the Way of the Burning Fist all over again!'\n\nNonetheless, after some consideration, Guy realised that he could match the first and half of the second condition by practising Yoga without adjusting his focus in between. So with great reluctance, Guy proceeded to do so.\n\nSlowly, as he progressed through the sequence of poses, Guy could actually feel his mind filtering out all the noise from the surrounding. Every sound, every smell, every touch, even every taste his brain deemed irrelevant was slowly phased out. Little by little, Guy was entering a state of complete blankness. His mind was literally empty of all thoughts.\n\nAt that point, Guy quickly alerted his idle mind to focus on himself.\n\n'Who am I? What is my purpose? Why do I do what I do? Why am I like this? What is wrong with me? Do I even deserve this? What did I do to benefit from this? I'M NOTHING BUT AN ENTITLED PRICK! I SHOULD HAVE JUST DIED!!!!'\n\n\"AAAARGHHH!\" Guy grunted while clutching his head in pain. He had dived in too quickly! Al had warned him about this. |Introspect| wasn't a trivial skill. In the process of grasping this skill, one is forced to confront their deepest fears. It is impossible to barrel through this.\n\n\"Deep breaths...\" Guy repeated. \"Slow and steady. Slow. And. Steady.\"\n\nGuy calmed himself and waited for the stabbing headache to pass, after which he restarted the sequence of poses.\n\nAfter a while, he once again entered the same state of complete blankness. Just as he practised before, Guy directed his focus inwards.\n\n'Who am I?' Guy quickly stopped his subconscious from moving further. He couldn't risk it like last time. The game had to be played at pace.\n\nOne at a time, Guy walked through each barrier his soul thrust forward in the form of a question with equally incisive answers. Guy was a mature man in his past life. Having to constantly observe and expose himself to the devastation of those truly unfortunate, he would often leave with a heavy burden in his heart. He had quickly come to terms with the fact that he was in a position of extreme privilege that couldn't be enjoyed by most others in the world. \n\nHis conscience recognised this and would often eat away at his sanity! To combat his, self-afflicted, deteriorating mental health, Guy scheduled regular appointments with his psychiatrist. Through frequent conversations and directed dives into his psyche, he had gotten to know himself better.\n\nUnfortunately, though, Guy hadn't put much effort into improving himself, much to his psychiatrist's chagrin. Guy had simply learned to live with his flaws, some of which ran so deep that those gazing from the outside would never even know they existed.\n\n'Do I even deserve this? A second chance? Another shot at happiness?'\n\nGuy sighed internally when faced with this question. Yet, without hesitation, Guy answered, \"No.\"\n\nBOOM!\n\nAn abstract explosion rippled through Guy's soul as a pair of massive gates jerked open in his mind. It was the sign Al told him to look out for. It was the indication signalling that Guy had grasped the ability to |Introspect|!\n\nGuy couldn't afford to divert his focus and celebrate this accomplishment. He paused for a bit to calm himself and metaphorically passed through the gates.\n\nSuddenly, he felt his senses rolling through a vacuum! His focus was being taken somewhere.\n\nBut where...?\n\nAs though to answer the question, he was unceremoniously plopped down from his rapid and claustrophobic transit to a new room.\n\nGuy once again paused to sharpen his focus. As his surroundings became clearer, he exclaimed with a mixture of shock and confusion, \"W-Why am I here?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-109]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":110,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 107 - Scepticism","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nAfter the chance encounter with great master Krish Nara, Marie's mind automatically drifted away from her earlier preoccupation with Kano's safety. Fortunately, or unfortunately, another issue had ingrained itself into her consciousness rather doggedly.\n\n\"What did he mean by that?\" She muttered out loud. \"Evaluate the why... Pssht!\" She scoffed.\n\n\"I ain't falling for that old trick!\" Of course, she wouldn't. Marie had seen it one too many times before: creating a false sense of urgency and mystery to cater to the human's natural penchant for curiosity. Marie was certain that this was just another tactic to fool the uninformed masses. \"A common huckster's ruse!\"\n\nYet regardless of her awareness of this fact, Marie was still, after all, just a human.\n\n\"No! It would be wrong to write it off without investigation,\" Marie said in trying to convince herself. Although logic dictated otherwise, her heart held a faint hope that it might actually be true.\n\n\"If I could peer into the future...\" She would no longer have to wallow in doubt and despair.\n\nSoothsayers weren't rare in this world. Marie had seen and met many of them before during her travels. She didn't know how many of them were legitimate, but that didn't matter. Because all of them had one thing in common and that was uncertainty. They would all preach that the future was never static and was always changing. Human actions and behaviours could influence the way events played out, and could potentially make a prediction invalid.\n\nA \"cop-out\", is what Marie considered them.\n\nYet great master Nara was different. He didn't embellish his words with a spurious addendum essentially leaving him with a backdoor. No. The man was certain, there was no wavering in his declaration.\n\nAccording to great master Nara, the future was set in stone. There was no changing it regardless of human intervention. It would have discouraged Marie if not for the man's penultimate addition which sort of contradicted him.\n\n\"He said that it was possible to change the future...\" But to do that, she would have to become his disciple.\n\nMarie refused to preoccupy herself with such uncertainties until she first verified if the man was legitimate. To do that, she had to employ what she had learned from Teacher Larks. She needed to use the scientific method.\n\nAs part of the process, Marie needed to collect data from a sufficiently diverse and apt sample. For this, she didn't have to look far.\n\nMarie strolled around the Twilight Village in search of subjects to interview. She didn't want to come across as intrusive and nosy, so she decided to target the people she was acquainted with first.\n\n\"Good morning Auntie Roe, Sister Colyn!\" Marie greeted as she walked past the fence of a quaint thatched house near the periphery of the village. At the porch of the house, sat a pair of mother-in-law and daughter, working industriously in sifting grains.\n\n\"Marie! How are you?\" The elderly woman beamed back. The younger woman sitting next to her leaned forward to stand, but was immediately impeded by her mother-in-law's gentle grasp, \"Colyn, you sit! Don't exert yourself unnecessarily.\"\n\nSister Colyn smiled bitterly and said, \"But mother, it's only walking up to the gate...\"\n\n\"Nonsense! One can never be too cautious when pregnant,\" Auntie Roe reprimanded, her gaze hovering lovingly over her daughter-in-laws blatantly evident and unusually large abdomen.\n\nThe elderly woman didn't entertain the conversation any further and walked over to let Marie in. \"What brings you here today, Marie?\" She asked as she opened the gates.\n\n\"Oh, nothing much. Just wanted to talk to Sister Colyn, that's all. I can come over another time if you are busy,\" Marie hinted.\n\n\"No, no. You two girls can talk. I need to make sure that lunch is prepared,\" Auntie Roe commented and walked into the house. Marie didn't dawdle further and sat next to Sister Colyn.\n\n\"How are you feeling nowadays, Sister Colyn?\" Marie asked with concern evident in her face. \"It looks... painfully large, doesn't it?\"\n\nSister Colyn giggled and responded excitedly, \"The village midwife believes that it might be twins. So it isn't unusual.\"\n\n\"You seem pretty elated on that prospect. Aren't you scared?\" Marie probed hesitantly.\n\n\"Scared? About what?\"\n\n\"Well... I've heard that birthing twins can get...\" Marie wavered in her tone and gestured the end of her sentence instead.\n\nSister Colyn laughed wholeheartedly and said, \"I'm not worried, no. Great master Nara predicted that the birth will be safe, and the children will be born healthy.\"\n\n\"And you believe him?\" Marie retorted.\n\nSister Colyn frowned slightly and chided Marie, \"Don't be so disrespectful, Marie. Great master Nara is an exceptional man. He rightly predicted when I would become pregnant, and the fact that it would be twins. Why wouldn't I believe it when he said that the birthing would be safe?\"\n\n\"He could easily have just inspected you...\" Marie muttered.\n\n\"What was that?\" Sister Colyn clarified.\n\n\"Is that really enough reason to believe someone so wholeheartedly?\"\n\n\"My worries are trivial, Marie. What reason would he have to deceive me? Besides, he didn't ask for payment or reimbursement. I don't see anything compelling me against trusting great master Nara.\"\n\n\"There is that as well...\" Marie muttered under her breath again. Ever since his arrival in this village, great master Nara had asked nary a soul for a single coin for his predictions. The only thing the man ever requested was assistance in building him a home.\n\nMarie conversed with Sister Colyn for a few more minutes before leaving towards her next target. Marie knew most of the people in the village personally, so her bout of collecting data wasn't hindered one bit. Every person she met that interacted with great master Nara had only good things to gush about him. Marie slowly felt herself getting brainwashed by the repetitive drones of praises and adorations.\n\nThe survey did offer her certain insights into Krish Nara as a person and about his powers. First, the man was always objective and detached. He offered the predictions in their raw form, without filter and embellishments. Some of the people Marie talked to threw in a few grumbles in between about how they felt that the man was a little rude or incisive. If the man were lying, he wouldn't adopt such a persona. Personally, Marie admired that about him. If the truth was unavoidable, it was unnecessary to garnish it with irrelevant details.\n\nSecondly, the man always avoided the path of changing the future. His solutions and advice often revolved around softening the blow or dealing with the problem head-on. That was also Marie's way of thinking. But compared to her, who prepared for the most probable scenarios, great master Nara knew exactly what would take place and offered measures tailored to that in particular. Yet this brought up the question worth a million gold coins: 'Since he so readily exposed that it was possible to change the future, why isn't he doing so?' Marie thought to herself.\n\nMarie's thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a loud crash to her right. Her gaze darted in that direction, and she saw a middle-aged woman hunched over on the ground and carefully collecting the spilt contents - freshly washed laundry - of her overturned basket.\n\n\"Auntie Lane!\" Marie called out and rushed over to help the crouched woman.\n\n\"Marie! Thank you so much,\" The woman smiled back.\n\nMarie joined the woman by getting on her knees and scrambling around to collect the clothes that had been strewn away in different directions.\n\nAuntie Lane sighed out loud and commented, \"I just washed them too...\"\n\n\"What happen-\" Marie was just about to finish the question, but her eyes locked on the woman's right hand. \"Your thumb! What happened to your thumb?\" Marie bellowed in surprise.\n\nThe woman glanced at her four-fingered right hand and simply shrugged, \"This isn't new. It's been like this for three, four weeks now.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? How did this happen?\"\n\n\"I had to give it up, you see,\" the woman clarified with a straight face.\n\n\"Give it up? For what?\"\n\nThe woman leaned forward and answered with a morose tone, \"For my and my child's life.\"\n\n\"What child?\" Marie blurted out thoughtlessly. She immediately regretted her decision and slapped her lips as a sign of apology. This was because everyone in the village knew about the struggles of the Lane husband and wife. The two were well into their thirties and lived a love-filled life. The husband worked as a driver for a profitable merchant's caravan and raked in a lot of money. They had a wonderful house in the village, better than most others. Yet the villagers were never envious of the couple. This was because, for all they had, they were lacking in one thing that they yearned for desperately. A child.\n\nWith their means, the two managed to consult a few physicians and determined that while neither of them was infertile, Auntie Lane's womb was problematic in that she was susceptible to miscarriages at the slightest of disturbances. Uncle Lane adored his wife deeply, and although he sorely wished to hold a son or daughter in his arms, the love for his wife superseded his animalistic urge to propagate his bloodline, which Marie felt admirable. And many wives in the village shared her opinion. The man had even separated from his family in a local town because they so feverously urged him to divorce and remarry.\n\nSo it was surprising when Autie Lane uttered those words. Marie almost thought that the woman had finally lost her mind due to her depression. But, instead of a heartbroken sulk, Auntie Lane's face blossomed into a smile filled with hope and love as she answered, \"Great master Nara predicted that I will finally birth a healthy boy! He said I would conceive within this month.\"\n\nMarie furrowed her brows and muttered, \"So that's why Uncle Lane has been so vibrant every day.\"\n\nAuntie Lane's aged face turned a crimson shade filled with the shyness of youth upon hearing that. She coughed out loud to dispel her embarrassment and got back to pick up her clothes with a lowered head.\n\n\"But that doesn't answer my question: What happened to your thumb?\"\n\nAuntie Lane answered without diverting her attention: \"Great master Nara predicted that I will birth a healthy boy. But he also predicted that I would face complications during his birth, and would die in the process.\" \n\nNearing the end, her tone had turned grim. After a short pause, she continued, \"Maybe I'm selfish. But I refuse to bring a child into this world at the cost of my life. I also want to hold my boy in my hands, kiss him, cuddle him, play with him, watch him as he gets married and has his own children. Is it too much to ask for both? But great master Nara said that it would be possible for me to live AND safely give birth to my boy... for a cost.\"\n\nMarie's mouth sprang agape at that revelation. This was the first time she had heard of great master Nara attempting to change the future from his predictions!\n\n\"So he took your thumb to change the future?\" Marie barked, only to receive the woman's innocent nod.\n\n\"And you believed him?\" She added.\n\n\"I did. And I don't regret anything. You must understand Marie, there was hope. I was finally going to get what my husband and I so desperately wanted. I would have chopped off my hand, let alone my thumb! Heck, even my husband was prepared to sacrifice his thumb right away. But the great master stopped him. He said that because it was my life, I had to be the one to give up something to balance the scales,\" Auntie Lane explained.\n\n\"Your life for a thumb? That doesn't seem right,\" Marie murmured.\n\n\"I asked him the same question. Great master said that the thumb was to influence a change. A shift in the flow of fate. Ultimately, the dominoes would fall in my favour, is what he said. Besides, it didn't hurt at all! I didn't have to chop it or anything. Just a second, was all it took.\"\n\nMarie conversed with Auntie Lane for a while longer, until all the clothes were securely folded back into the basket. As she watched the woman's figure walk away, while clumsily grasping at the basket placed securely over her head with her thumbless right hand, Marie contemplated on everything she had learned today.\n\n'That's it! It is possible to change the future, but there is a cost to facilitate this!' Marie concluded. That made a lot of sense. But Marie didn't delude herself into thinking that she could crack the code just by discerning these facts. The cultivation art, The Heavenly Eye, definitely housed many secrets that expounded on this process - it wasn't as straightforward as just cutting off a thumb or two randomly.\n\nHowever, Marie realised that if she wanted to learn this, she had to take the unpredictable step of entering great master Nara's discipleship.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-108]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":111,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 106 - Fate's Infuriating Machinations","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\"Pffft!\" Marie burst into laughter upon hearing Krish's declaration.\n\n\"Hahahaha!

The man was not joking!\n\n\"Are you serious?\" Marie coughed out while trying to suppress her mirth.\n\nKrish hummed and answered nonchalantly, \"Beyond the information I've already provided you lie secrets and insights related to the cultivation method I practice. If you really want to know more, I'm afraid that you'll have to devote yourself to my school of magic.\"\n\n\"So if I say yes, you would willingly take me on as your Disciple and teach me to cultivate?\"\n\n\"I would,\" Krish affirmed. \"I would take you under my wing and train you in my school of magic.\"\n\n\"And which school is that?\"\n\n\"The Heavenly Eye,\" Krish replied.\n\nMarie narrowed her eyes as she probed, \"I've never heard of it before.\"\n\n\"Which schools HAVE you heard of?\" Krish snorted in response.\n\n\"I've heard of plenty,\" Marie retorted immediately. \"There's \"The Incidiary Fist\", \"The Righteous Sword\", \"The Impenetrable Arts\" and \"The Loquacious Lightning\" schools of magic.\"\n\nKrish squinted in disbelief before blurting out, \"You just made those up!\"\n\n\"Whatever!

Why would practitioners from such famous schools of magic want me?\"\n\n\"Hah! There is no winning with you. Would there ever be a situation in which you wouldn't be sceptical?\"\n\nMarie clicked her tongue and retorted, \"There wouldn't be a single case in which I wouldn't be suspicious.\"\n\nShe crossed her hands over her chest and expounded, \"The probabilities of such a situation taking place are infinitesimal for me to think otherwise. They are in decimals so small that if such an event did occur it would be pure coincidence. And, I don't trust coincidences. Anything that sounds too good to be true, is in fact too good to be true.

When I sent Markus off to the Academy, it was within my calculation, albeit with a minuscule percentage, that a Teacher would take notice of him and pull him under their personal tutelage. Teacher Larks' arrival here wasn't a coincidence. Given sufficient time, I can trace a clear sequence of dominoes leading up to this situation.\" Marie paused before continuing with a bitter expression, \"Besides, even he isn't willing to teach me magic.\"\n\n\"That's only because you lack purpose,\" Krish responded nonchalantly.\n\n\"How did you know that?\" Marie jabbed back with a suspicious glare.\n\n\"You seem to forget who you're talking to, girl.\"\n\n\"Well...\" Marie muttered. \"That's all the more reason for me to be suspicious! Why would you be so willing to accept a student that lacks direction?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter to me. You are fated with The Heavenly Eye. Ultimately, you are guaranteed to learn under me no matter how hard you try to fight it,\" Krish shrugged out with a cunning smile.\n\n\"You seem pretty confident about that. Now that you've revealed this information, what's stopping me from avoiding you altogether?\" Marie challenged.\n\n\"Because that's just how the world works. That's just how humans work. To borrow your earlier analogy, the dominoes have already been set. Knowing that they will fall won't change anything.\"\n\nKrish smirked as he continued, \"Of course your fate isn't truly set in stone. You can change it, but for that, you will need to be inducted into my school of magic.\"\n\nMarie snorted in response, \"You know that just now, you sounded exactly like a con-man?\"\n\n\"It's the truth!\" Krish said offhandedly. \"Anyways. Since you aren't ready to accept me as your Master yet, just return to what you were doing. But before you go, I want to give you one last piece of advice. For free, of course!\"\n\n\"A person's fate is unavoidable. Therefore, rather than becoming preoccupied with the what, evaluate the why!\" Krish enunciated.\n\n\"That sounds unnecessarily complicated. What are you even saying?\"\n\nKrish simply waved his hands and closed his eyes, \"Leave, girl! It's time for my meditation.\"\n\nMarie stood in place in disbelief at Krish's sudden shift in behaviour. 'Why isn't he following the script?'\n\nMarie still believed that Krish was trying to con her. Although she believed in his powers of foresight, the whole spiel about fate sounded so preposterous that she was confident it was just Krish's attempt to tempt her through a psychological gambit. She had heard of many such instances when unwitting girls were hoodwinked by hustlers dressed as mage experts with the prospect of learning magic, only to be captured and sold off somewhere else as a slave, or something worse.\n\nAlthough, in those stories, the hustlers were usually unparalleled hunks whose appearance alone overpowered the girls' rationalities. But Krish was just so... \n\n'Old... Maybe this is a new strategy. After all, looking older does evoke greater confidence.'\n\nPeople would be more inclined to believe an elderly individual than a younger one, especially when it came to magic. But Marie was certain that she wouldn't be fooled by Krish's appearance. She was prepared to test the man further.\n\nHowever, contrary to her expectations, Krish just stopped talking after stating his piece. Either the man was an inexperienced con artist or he was an unparalleled professional in the field who was confident that the \"seedling\" he had planted in her mind would definitely take root and influence her.\n\nBut Marie wasn't having any of it! 'Hmph! He can't fool me!' She told herself as she left the premises of Krish's cottage.\n\nAs she walked away, though, an intrusive thought shot out from the back of her mind. 'What if he was speaking the truth?'\n\nShe shook her head to scrub the thought and continued walking. However, could her rationality allow such a thing?\n\n____\n\nKrish exhaled out loud with exhaustion as he observed Marie's retreating figure.\n\n\"Why her?\" He muttered out loud. \"Of all people... Why her?\" He complained.\n\nAfter weeks of inactivity, the auspicious cloud hanging over the village had started growing clearer. Finally, after months of living with uncertainty, Krish was shown who the next torch-bearer for The Heavenly Eye would be.\n\nLo and behold, it was Marie Reva.\n\nAt that time Krish couldn't suppress the intense twitch afflicting his right eyelids upon witnessing this.\n\n\"Should I just not bother and let myself corrode over time?\" He contemplated out loud. In his mind, the prospect of nurturing the belligerent girl was almost equivalent to dying!\n\n\"Darn my luck!\" Yet there wasn't anything Krish could do about it. Those with an affinity towards The Heavenly Eye were fated individuals. If Krish didn't follow through with what fate had lined up for him, then he would have to suffer the wrath of the Universe. And the Universe never compromised with its retribution.\n\nKrish started lamentingly at his shrivelled right leg. If there was one thing Krish was proud of during his youth, as a mortal, it was his perfectly sculpted legs. All the women in his family had flawlessly curvaceous legs. The men in his village would line up outside his house every morning, just to get a glimpse of his sisters' legs as they went out to tend to the farm. Many even professed their readiness to die, crushed between those voluptuous thighs.\n\nAs the youngest, and only son, of the family Krish was also gifted with this lineage. However, unlike his sisters, whose legs retained just the perfect amount of fat and muscle to maintain a sensual allure, his legs were prone to rapid muscle hypertrophy even with the minimum amount of exercise.\n\nHis thighs would fill in his trousers, threatening to tear through them at any moment. His calves would bulge out invitingly with each step. The girls in his village would openly fantasize about laying their heads on Krish's muscled lap. Some would even sneak a peak when he bathed in the river nearby!\n\nThe feature Krish was most attached to, and almost arrogant about, were his chiselled legs. And it was the first thing the Universe took away from him after his rampant use of The Heavenly Eye to change his family's fate.\n\nThe Universe was extremely cruel in doling out its punishment. It didn't take away his legs altogether - they were still attached to his body. However, it attacked his right leg with a disease that impaired the mana channels weaving through them. No matter what he tried to do, the disease kept advancing. Every healer he consulted failed to track down a cure for the affliction due to its inherently elusive nature. It was as though the disease itself was sentient.\n\nBefore he knew it, the disease stepped out from the magical realms and began eating away at his physical body. First, he lost all feeling in his legs as the nerve endings were disintegrated. Then, it started to eat away at his muscles, shrivelling the area up over time. Finally, it arrived at his bones, turning them as fragile as glass.\n\nOne healer suggested amputating the leg and regrowing it through alchemical solutions. Seeing as it was the only option left, Krish went with it. He chopped off his husk of a leg and imbibed a regular dosage of highly-concentrated vitality and regeneration potions to regrow the stump.\n\nWithin days, he had successfully regrown his right leg. However, the moment the regeneration effect stopped, the same affliction attacked the new leg, but this time with increased ferocity. While there was a lack of pain the last time, this time the disease didn't hold back in its assault. Krish suffered through an excruciating month that felt like a lifetime, after which he was left with the very same husk of a right leg he sought to cure initially.\n\nThe worst part was that it didn't affect both his legs. Krish still had an intact and working left leg with equal, if not superior, musculature. However, due to its proximity to a shrivelled up mass, it pained Krish even more. Sometimes, Krish wished that the Universe had just taken away both his legs in one fell swoop. At least he wouldn't feel so horrible every day.\n\nTherefore, there was nothing Krish could do to contend against fate's machinations without accumulating additional damage upon himself. Based on his understanding of the Universe, it wouldn't attack his working leg. No, it could even take away something else he deemed precious.\n\nKrish subconsciously covered his crotch region in fear as a shiver tingled through his spine.\n\n\"But the girl is just so... argumentative!\" That was Krish's greatest peeve with his fated Disciple. He had never seen another person so willing to go up in arms about everything. The girl was sceptical about everything; she refused to believe anything at face value. She needed reason and explanation, irrefutable beyond doubt. Krish was getting a headache just thinking about their future together.\n\n\"How is anyone supposed to teach her if she intends to argue about everything?\" He exclaimed.\n\nBut then Krish realised that there was in fact one individual who had penetrated through the girl's infuriating barriers and effectively taught her.\n\nKrish retrained his senses on the figure of that man in question at the orphanage.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-107]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":112,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 105 - An Offer","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nAn uneventful week passed almost instantly.\n\nOn this particular day, the members of the orphanage were congregated near the outskirts of the village. They were here in preparation to send Kano off on his journey with Goran Rasmus.\n\n\"Remember, Kano. Talk less, listen more. And think twice before speaking. You will be following Mister Rasmus, so we mustn't cause him any troubles,\" Guy instructed.\n\n\"And make sure to eat your food on time. Don't be picky and eat whatever you are given!\" Grace added while suppressing her sobs.\n\n\"Matron Reva, Teacher Larks, please don't worry. Kano will be in safe hands. Besides, we will be back before you even know it!\" Goran said to alleviate the affected woman.\n\n\"M-M-Matron...\" Kano mumbled with a low expression. He rubbed his eyes with his sleeves and promised, \"I'll return quickly, okay? Please don't cry...\"\n\n\"I'm not crying,\" Grace denied vehemently, however, the gushing stream of tears indicated otherwise.\n\nKano leapt forward and hugged Grace, \"I'll miss you, Matron!\"\n\n\"I'll miss you too, Kano!\"\n\nThe woman and child cried uncontrollably in each other's embrace. Although dramatic, no one wanted to interfere lest they received Grace's undiverted wrath.\n\nAfter two minutes of tears and hiccups, the two separated. Kano was led into the carriage by Goran, which departed almost immediately. Kano's little head popped out of the side and he started waving while yelling at the top of his lungs, \"Good-bye! I'll be back soon!\"\n\nGrace waved back with equal gusto.\n\nA minute after the carriage receded around the treelines, Grace turned around and spoke with a dismayed tone, \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\"Huh? Where's Dora?\" Grace inquired.\n\n\"She's back at the orphanage. She refused to come down,\" Marie responded with a frown.\n\n\"What's gotten into her? She didn't wish Kano safe travels?\"\n\n\"She seemed a bit grumpy...\" Markus explained.\n\n\"That girl...-\"\n\n\"Let me go talk to her,\" Marie interjected, and then turned and walked up the inclining path towards the orphanage at a brisk pace.\n\n____\n\n\"Huuuu *sob* *sob* huuuun,\" a monotonous and suppressed wail resonated from behind the closed doors leading to Kano and Dora's room.\n\nMarie approached the door and knocked, \"Dora?\"\n\n\"Go away! Huuuuu *sob*...\" A quivering girl's voice barked back.\n\n\"Dora, I'm coming in,\" Marie declared as she slowly pushed the door open.\n\nDora lay facedown on her sleeping mattress sobbing vehemently. Marie approached the girl and gently pulled her in for a hug.\n\n\"Why are you crying, Dora?\" Maria voiced calmly. \"Do you miss Kano?\"\n\n\"NO!\" Dora screamed between hiccups. \"That jerk! He left without me. Huuuuu.\"\n\nMarie slowly patted Dora's head and explained in a soothing voice, \"He isn't going out to have fun, you know? He wants to learn how to become a better artist. It would have been so boring, why would you want to go?\"\n\n\"*sob* I wanted to go to the city too,\" Dora replied.\n\n\"It's okay. We can go together once you grow up,\" Marie responded to assuage Dora.\n\n\"But that will take so long... Huuuuu.\"\n\nMarie didn't know what to say to the girl. In the end, she simply hugged her closer and let Dora cry herself out.\n\n\"*sob* Marie...\" Dora murmured.\n\n\"Hmmm?\"\n\n\"Will he be okay? Will Kano be okay?\" Dora asked with worry in her tone.\n\n\"I-\" Marie wanted to reply that he would be fine. But she couldn't voice it. She couldn't say for sure.\n\nInstead, Marie said, \"He's with Mister Rasmus...\"\n\nWould he be fine? Marie was worried too! The last time one of her siblings went to the city, he returned a complete wreck. Or at least he would have if not for the timely intervention of Teacher Larks. Hearing Markus' earlier outburst, Marie had a pretty good idea of the situation. She had falsely assumed that the city would be any better than the rest of the world.\n\n'It's all the same.'\n\nIn her effort to scrounge up money for her family, Marie had to go through a lot of struggles. There were things she'd seen and experienced that haunted her to date. Being of a disadvantaged gender, she had to put up with the worst this world had to offer her. Over time she had grown immune and cynical, unaffected by things around her.\n\nYet, as long as her family thrived, it would all be worth it. As an orphan, Marie was starved of love in her life. After losing her parents at a young age, she had to fight against the world on her own to survive. By the time she hit seven years of age, she was already working multiple jobs to the bone to earn a morsel to fill her emaciated tummy.\n\nSo one could imagine just how elated she was when Matron Reva found her and took her in. After years of being deprived of even the most basic of human decencies, Marie finally received the love and care she yearned of.\n\nBut love can become an addictive drug to those deprived of it from a young age. After tasting the bliss of familiar love, Marie was unwilling to lose it. Not this time!\n\nMarie had learned the only people she could depend on in this life were the people close to her. Her family. So, she was willing to sacrifice anything as long as her family could thrive. As long as she could keep her family in one piece, safe and secured, it would all be worth it...\n\nIt was for that very reason that Marie supported Markus' decision to pursue magic. The family needed protection from the forces that sought to hurt it. Marie had suffered under many arrogant young masters and mistresses, drunk on power. \n\nAlthough Marie and her family were relatively safe here in this out-of-the-way village, one could never predict when misfortune may strike. Marie would have loved to become the shield, however, her logical brain knew that Markus was in a better position to learn magic. He was younger. More malleable.\n\nBut Marie failed to consider the human element! She hadn't accounted for the bullying Markus would have to go through in that ruthless crucible. She had already experienced the vindicativeness of those rich young masters. But, what about the rich young masters with magic in their arsenal? They could only be worse!\n\nShe had been too selfish! She had offloaded all the burdens she carried onto Markus, the poor boy.\n\nThankfully, she didn't lose him. Thankfully, Teacher Larks had saved him.\n\nBut this decision to send Kano away... It was eating away at her! It came out of nowhere, and contrary to Marie's expectations, when Matron Reva agreed to it.\n\nAlthough she trusted Matron Reva with all her heart, Marie couldn't suppress the growing unrest within. She hadn't performed a satisfactory risk assessment.\n\n'Will he be okay?'\n\n\"The boy will be fine. If that's what you're worried about,\" an elderly voice interrupted Marie's train of thought.\n\nMarie snapped out of her trancelike state and observed her surroundings. It seemed as though in her preoccupation, she had subconsciously descended from the orphanage and arrived at the village.\n\n\"Ah! great master Krish Nara,\" Marie greeted respectfully. Although she hadn't interacted much with the old soothsayer, Marie had heard a lot of things about him from the villagers. Interestingly, nearly all of them showered praises on the old man and his uncanny power of future sight.\n\nMarie scratched her head as she pondered how to approach the topic in a better way.\n\n\"The boy has good fortune written in his fate. He will amount to great things,\" Krish added while closing his eyes.\n\n\"H-How can you be sure?\" Marie retorted hesitantly.\n\n\"Are you doubting me, girl?\" Krish replied with a frown.\n\n\"No!\" Marie quickly denied while waving her hands. \"It's just... How can you say for certain that Kano will be fine? What evidence led you to that conclusion?\"\n\nKrish chuckled as he answered, \"Why should I have to tell you all of that? This is a matter of belief, isn't it?\"\n\n\"But that doesn't assuage me one bit,\" Marie responded.\n\n\"How is that my problem? I offered you my insight regarding the trouble you're facing. It's up to you whether to accept it,\" Krish clarified.\n\nMarie sighed in dismay. \"I want to believe you, I do! I can convince my heart to accept your claim. But my mind constantly urges me to question its validity. Unless I can verify and substantiate the claim, I don't think I can believe it. It's not you, great master.\"\n\n\"If your Teacher Larks made the same claim, wouldn't you believe him?\" Krish asked probingly.\n\nMarie furrowed her brows in contemplation before answering, \"If it were Teacher Larks, he would probably provide sufficient evidence to back his claim. So yes, I would believe him!\"\n\n\"You have great faith in the man?\"\n\n\"That's just the kind of person he is,\" Marie clarified. \"He never makes a claim he isn't sure about or cannot prove.\"\n\nKrish laughed heartily as he reached into his bag. While pulling out his almanacks and conch shells, he declared, \"Now you're making me jealous.\"\n\n\"Look carefully, girl! I won't repeat this again,\" Krish declared and grasped a handful of conch shells in his palm. He dropped them on the flat wooden table in front of him and observed the spread with his Heavenly Eye.\n\n\"Hmm... Three overturned... Let's see... Similar spread as that time...\" Krish muttered as he intermittently cross-referenced through the pages on an almanack.\n\n\"See here?\" He finally said while pointing at a paragraph in his book. \"The spread is similar. The conditions are also similar. This indicates that the boy's travel will be fruitful and will result in positive growth.\"\n\nMarie squinted her eyes as she read the squiggly lines on the page. \"Your handwriting is unbearably illegible,\" she murmured.\n\nKrish snorted as she immediately shut the book, \"I didn't write it down to share it with other people! Anyways, as you can see I've corroborated my claims. Now, do you believe me?\"\n\nMarie showed a wry expression as she replied, \"A little. But it isn't enough.\"\n\n\"HA!\" Krish bellowed mirthfully. \"Fine! I can reveal more to you. But...\"\n\nKrish paused for dramatic effect and leaned closer. He wore a serious expression as he declared, \"I will need you to accept me as your Master.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-106]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":113,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 104 - Kano's Request","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Are you crazy?!\" Goran bellowed, causing Kano to shrink behind Al.\n\n\"Goran!\" Al reminded with a firm tone.\n\n\"*cough* Sorry. What I meant to say was: Why are you cleaning the wall, Kano?\" Goran repeated while wearing a strained yet calmer demeanour.\n\n\"I-I-I wanted to draw something else and I need space,\" Kano confessed with a low murmur.\n\n\"If that's the case then why this wall in particular?\"\n\n\"This wall is least exposed to the environment,\" Kano explained. \"Even if there is rain or heavy w-w-winds, this wall is not affected that much.\"\n\nAt this point, Mylo chimed in, \"The boy's right. I've inspected the building thoroughly, and this wall is in markedly better condition than the rest.\"\n\nGoran and Al were both impressed by the kid's superior instincts.\n\n\"See, Al! I told you this kid's a genius!\" Goran voiced out with a hearty smile.\n\n\"But Kano, why are you limiting yourself to this wall as a medium? Haven't you considered others?\" Goran continued.\n\nKano smiled bitterly and replied, \"I have. But we c-c-can't afford better paper or paint.\"\n\n\"That's it?\" Goran retorted in disbelief. \"Boy, you should have told me that earlier!\"\n\nGoran reached into his coat and retrieved his own storage disk. While channelling his mana into it, he pointed it towards the ground. The disk lit up immediately and from its centre, a steady stream of items started to gush out.\n\nPaint. Brushes. Paper. Ink. Chalk. Grindstones. It was a near endless downpour of supplies, well beyond Kano's wildest dreams, most of which Kano had only heard of from Marie's intermittent stories from her travels.\n\nWith gleaming eyes, Kano approached the organised mound of art supplies and exclaimed with excitement.\n\n\"I bought these the last time I returned to the city. I was waiting to give them to you, now seems just as good a time as any.\" Goran explained.\n\n\"B-B-But Mister Rasmus. This is a lot... I can't accept it...\" Kano said in dismay.\n\n\"Why not? Don't overthink things, lad. Just accept these as an investment on my part. After seeing just how promising your talent was, I am investing in you by nurturing you and helping you develop your craft,\" Goran retorted while waving his hand.\n\nKano's face alternated between a few emotions, as he internally debated the quandary of whether he should accept such a generous gift. In the end, his childish elation won over and an unblemished smile bloomed on his face.\n\n\"Thank you so much, Uncle!\" Kano shouted as he rushed over and hugged Goran. Due to the height difference, the boy barely reached above the man's knees. Goran bent over slightly and patted the kid's ruffled hair.\n\n\"Speaking of investment. Can I talk to you for a bit, Kano?\" Goran inquired. \"It's to do with your future, and I wanted to hear your opinion on it.\"\n\nHearing Kano's affirmation, Goran instructed Mylo to finish the initial inspection by himself, and then led Kano to the classroom.\n\nAfter the two assumed seats opposite each other, Goran began, \"I know that you constantly dismiss me every time I bring this point up, but Kano you are a gifted child. You have a talent in the visual arts that others can only dream of.\"\n\n\"T-T-t-\"\n\n\"Let me finish, child. Your comprehension of colour and form is beyond your years. You may underplay it, but I've seen many, many more renowned works in my lifetime and I can confidently affirm that your work has the potential to match and even exceed the contemporary works by forerunners in the field. Sure, as it stands, your work lacks refinement and proper direction. After all, you don't have a proper teacher to guide you in this.\"\n\nGoran noticed the boy getting ready to bear arms against him for the last statement and quickly assuaged him, \"Don't get me wrong! Teacher Larks is amazing. He is knowledgeable and has a demeanour befitting a teacher. However, when it comes to the arts I strongly believe that limiting oneself to a singular teacher is an artist's greatest pitfall.\"\n\nKano frowned in contemplation.\n\n\"Do you enjoy painting?\"\n\n\"I do!\" Kano affirmed immediately.\n\n\"That's good. Do you want to get better in your craft?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"If that is the case, then I strongly urge you to consider this offer. In order to truly become a great artist, one must expose themselves to everything the world has to offer. Inspiration isn't gained by holing yourself in a secluded space. Furthermore, one cannot grow without observing and learning from the successes and mistakes of others. So, I would like you to come with me to the city to explore the art scene and broaden your horizon. Who knows? Maybe you'll learn something in the process?\"\n\nKano was immediately taken by the idea. Although he tried to hide it, his face blossomed with excitement at the prospect of going to the city.\n\n\"You don't have to make a decision. After all, Matron Reva is still your guardian. I will discuss it with her at a later date. But I need you to put in a good word if you're interested in this. I feel like the Matron isn't particularly fond of me...\"\n\n____\n\nGrace, Guy, Markus, Marie, Kano and Dora were seated on the floor, eating dinner together. This had been a longstanding tradition in the orphanage, and Guy had seamlessly assimilated himself into it.\n\nThe strained family ate their food in silence which was unusual. Most of the time, the two kids would talk about something or the other, drawing the teens or the adults into the conversation as well. However, today the two were uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nDora seemed a little checked out as if she was preoccupied with something. Kano, on the other hand, simply couldn't stop himself from fidgeting. He looked as though there was something on the tip of his tongue, but was hesitating to vocalise it.\n\nUnable to take it anymore, the boy broke the silence with a loud declaration, \"I want to travel with Mister Rasmus to Radiant City!\"\n\nEveryone else on the table froze in place and darted their attention towards the boy.\n\n\"You want to do what?\" Grace asked while narrowing her eyes.\n\n\"I... I want to go to Radiant City with Mister Rasmus. I want to explore the art scene.\"\n\n\"Explore the art scene? Do you even know what that means?\" Grace snorted.\n\n\"Yea! It's... It's... Exploring the... He said it was looking at different famous art pieces and learning from t-t-them,\" Kano replied.\n\n\"So you want to go all the way to the city just to see paintings on a wall?\" Grace retorted while raising her voice.\n\n\"Mister Rasmus says that this is the b-b-best way for me to become a better artist.\"\n\nGrace frowned and her nostril flared with anger. Right as she was about to open her mouth and bring down the hammer, Guy interrupted her, \"Grace, can I talk to you outside for a minute?\"\n\n\"Huh? Why?\"\n\n\"Please. It's important.\"\n\n\"*sigh* Can't it wait?\"\n\nGuy just stood up and walked out of the room, gesturing at Grace to follow him.\n\n\"We're not finished with this conversation!\" Grace declared at Kano as she stood up.\n\nGuy took Grace to the next room and looked at her with a sheepish smile.\n\n\"By the look on your face back there, I could tell that you were going to deny Kano. But, before you say no to him, just take some time and think about it. I think it is a good opportunity for Kano. Besides, I've already talked to Mister Rasmus about it. He's interested in sponsoring Kano. He thinks the boy shows promise and wants to help him develop his skill.\"\n\n\"How come he talked to you and not me? I'm Kano's guardian!\" Grace retorted.\n\n\"Mister Rasmus said that the last time he talked with you, you just kept nodding back at him like a chicken mindlessly pecking at grains...\"\n\n\"What? I did not!\" Grace denied vehemently while scoffing.\n\n\"I know that you're apprehensive about sending Kano far away. But he'll be safe with Mister Rasmus.\"\n\n\"I don't trust him!\"\n\n\"Teacher Jeeves can vouch for him, Grace.\"\n\n\"I don't trust him either!\"\n\n\"*sigh* What about me then? You've known me long enough, right? Don't you trust me?\" Guy asked while trying his hardest to look cute.\n\n\"You!\" Grace was at a loss for words after facing Guy's shameless attack.\n\n\"Can't you teach Kano? You've already taught him so much. Can't you also teach him how to draw and paint?\" Grace pleaded. \"Why does he need to go so far away? I don't want him to suffer as Markus did...\"\n\n\"The subject isn't in my wheelhouse, Grace. Although I can teach him a few basics, I can't help him develop beyond that. The boy needs to expose himself to the world and grow his artistic philosophy organically.\" Guy paused before addressing Grace's primary concern. \"Besides, Markus didn't have anyone backing him. Kano has the leader of one of the more prominent clans in this Kingdom bankrolling him! What more could we ask for?\"\n\nGrace showed a strained expression as she pondered over the topic. Having taken care of the twins since a young age, Grace was extremely attached to them. In many ways, she viewed them as her own children. It was only natural that she was apprehensive to let one of them go, especially so early in their life.\n\n\"Fine. I'll take your word for it,\" Grace said as she drew closer to Guy with a stern expression. \"BUT! If anything happens to Kano. I swear on my life, I will destroy you!\"\n\nGuy shuddered at Grace's palpable threats. Right as Grace was turning to leave, she froze in her tracks and double-backed, \"By the way, why did you have to bring me out here to discuss this? Couldn't you have just done this out there?\"\n\nGuy shook his head and explained, \"That wouldn't look good for you. To the kids, you would come across as the \"bad cop\", the one who always says no. In the future, if they have any requests they will avoid you and come to me. They will lose respect for you in the process. You see, kids are superficial. They are only receptive to positive reinforcement. They don't understand the intricacies behind reprimands or taboos. So in cases like this, we, the adults, must come across as a united front.\"\n\nGrace exhaled in amusement and commented, \"So you did it for my benefit?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Guy declared resolutely.\n\nGrace suppressed an erupting smile and clicked her tongue as she rushed out.\n\nGuy gazed warmly at Grace's receding back and murmured with a long sigh, \"I'll get through eventually.

When you called me in and commissioned the project, I assumed that it was somewhere close to the city. But this place...\"\n\nThe man still shuddered when he recollected the gruelling, backbreaking carriage ride from the city to this out-of-the-way village.

This orphanage is a fairly complete structure, so I think it would be advisable to build a separate building for the Young Miss as opposed to a simple attachment,\" Mylo continued. \"Furthermore, I didn't anticipate just how secluded the location would be when I provided the ambitious estimate of three weeks. If I'm being optimistic, the work can be finished within a month.\"\n\nGoran nodded and added, \"I understand. If you need anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to let me know. The construction must be finished as soon as possible, money isn't an issue. Also, I hope that we can keep this under wraps.\"\n\nGoran gradually exuded more pressure on Mylo as he stressed a point, \"We wouldn't want news about Jean's new arrangements circulating amongst unwelcome crowds now, would we?\"\n\nMylo suppressed the sweat threatening to trickle down his back and answered firmly, \"I wouldn't dare! We at Saga and Sons Constructions pride ourselves in our privacy and confidentiality.\"\n\nThat was the truth. The only reason Mylo's homegrown family business managed to thrive amongst the upper echelons of society was due to its ability to compartmentalise information within the organisation.\n\nIt was an insane idea brought forward by his eldest son - to pivot the thriving construction business to cater purely to the rich. Mylo nearly flogged his son with his shoes right then and there! Thankfully, the boy had the presence of mind to elaborate upon the pitch and brought forth data to corroborate the profitability of the venture.\n\nSure, Mylo had to sacrifice a few metaphorical limbs of his business to enter this market, however, the results more than made up for it. Surprisingly, this new market happened to be a lot stabler than he had anticipated.\n\nBefore, he'd have to scramble to different private and public bids and grovel at various government officials to secure projects for his company. Although the projects were long-term and high-paying, economically they weren't efficient.\n\nHowever, after pivoting to the more bespoke construction markets, while the projects were often short-term the payout was immense!\n\nAs the rich got richer, and as more families and organisations rose above the dividing line that separated the average folk from the upper class, the demand for more elaborate and decorative construction projects kept coming in. Mylo didn't have to offer much except for exclusivity, quality, and secrecy.\n\nExclusivity, because the rich never liked to see a copy of an item they owned with another. Be it clothing, jewellery, or even housing. Mylo had already seen many cases when large portions of mansions were torn down just because a neighbour or relative happened to share the same style of interior decoration. Heck, one customer even asked to change all the lightings in their house by a minor shade because it resembled the lighting at their neighbour's front entrance!\n\nThe rich valued quality in their purchases for the same reason as everyone else. No one would want their hard-earned money to be siphoned into a shabby purchase. It was even more important when the purchase happened to be a long-term investment like a house or a structure. Although the rich sank their funds into such ventures more often than the regular folk, they did so with the goal to raise their prestige. To that end, Mylo had to change his mindset a little bit when approaching these projects. Because not only did the structure have to maintain its high quality, this parameter had to be evident at a cursory glance as well. The product had to advertise itself, without the need for someone to point it out.\n\nFinally, the rich valued secrecy for a multitude of reasons. The first, and most important, was to protect themselves against physical attacks from those that sought to hurt them. No one would like the blueprints of their households floating around in the market for everyone to see. It was especially the case for the rich since enemies were an inevitable byproduct of amassing wealth. The second was to protect themselves from damage caused by \"subtler\" means.\n\nFor instance, if a certain patron had particular sexual proclivities that couldn't be disclosed to the general public, they could commission for a subterranean attachment to their household that was secluded from peeping eyes. Of course, if this information happened to leak out, it would be truly unfortunate for both the party in question and Mylo himself who would have to bear the complete wrath of the party.\n\nTo that, Mylo practised the \"Don't ask, Don't tell,\" line of thought. The organisation also had to go through serious restructuring to ensure that such sensitive pieces of information weren't shared haphazardly.\n\nAnyways, Mylo was grateful to his most loyal patrons, the Rasmus clan. Not once did they ask him to build a truly degenerate sex dungeon, secret housing for a hidden family, or barracks for a secret army to rebel against the crown. All three of which his competitors were commissioned to do, and were subsequently annihilated after the information was brought to light.\n\nThis particular project, while simple in technicality, was actually quite difficult to undertake. After all, it would be truly impossible to keep the movement of various building resources and workforce occluded from peeping Toms. Be that as it may, Mylo had taken on this job and now it was his responsibility to carry it to the end.\n\nAs Mylo and Goran walked and discussed the particulars, they happened to reach the location of the classroom.\n\nGoran subtly changed the topic of the conversation and asked, \"Have you also looked through what I asked? About improving this orphanage?\"\n\n\"I have. As I've said before, this orphanage is a fairly complete structure. And interestingly, its architecture is quite advanced and well-established. It is completely out of place compared to the village. While old, it's extremely robust and resilient. To make changes to this house without damaging it, we will need to be meticulous.\"\n\nGoran interrupted Mylo's explanation and asked with slight impatience, \"So what about my request?\"\n\n\"For that, I will need to inspect the section in person before making a judgement,\" Mylo answered.\n\nThe two happened to turn the corner and were surprised to find another individual gazing intensely at a wall.\n\n\"Al!\" Goran greeted.\n\n\"Goran,\" Al replied casually, without averting his gaze.\n\nMylo put two-and-two together, and quickly bowed with respect, \"T-Teacher Jeeves! I am honoured to make your acquaintance!\"\n\nAl simply hummed and waved his hand in acknowledgement. He completely refused to look away from the painting of the Red Dragon called Smaug from the wall.\n\nHis forehead furrowed with a frown as he said, \"I don't see it!\"\n\n\"*sigh* You need to learn how to appreciate art, my friend,\" Goran replied.\n\nAl harrumphed and retorted, \"I'll have you know that I have a 2-star license in the field of visual arts!\"\n\n\"Oh please! You rushed through it all for the sake of earning the license. Did you actually sit down and study the works wholeheartedly?\"\n\nAl showed a wry expression and retrained his gaze on the painting. He took it as a challenge when he was unable to observe the intricacies of this seemingly arcane work painted by a child. He'd spent hours in front of this wall, like an idiot, and still failed to glean anything. Right now, Al wanted to take out his license from the Artists' Guild and throw it into the sea!\n\n\"This wall here,\" Goran said to Mylo. \"Can you remove it without damaging the painting?\"\n\n\"Huh?!\" Mylo voiced in confusion.\n\n\"I want to remove this wall as it is and transport it to a more secure location. Is it possible to do so without damaging the painting on the wall?\" Goran repeated.\n\nMylo observed the wall, and the painting on it, and tried to make sense of the request. Although architecture was a technical field, there was an underlying sense of artistry and aesthetics to it. Hence, Mylo was receptive to other works of art. Yet, he couldn't find anything of importance in the piece of work before him. It looked unrefined and lacked precision.\n\nHowever, he didn't voice those thoughts out loud. It wasn't his place to do so, after all.\n\nMylo approached the wall and tapped around the edges with his ears plastered against the surface. After a few more inspections, he declared with certainty.\n\n\"It is possible. It shouldn't be too difficult. However, it will be a more complicated task to source the same materials used to make this wall when we plan to replace it.\"\n\n\"That's not an issue. I want to secure this wall from the environment as soon as possible,\" Goran repeated.\n\n\"Did you ask Guy's permission for this, though?\" Al commented.\n\n\"I did. But then Teacher Larks said to ask the matron. So I asked her, but she just kept nodding to everything I said. I don't think she was even listening to me. She had this tuned-out look on her face the entire time,\" Goran reasoned.\n\n\"It doesn't seem right to take advantage of her kindness like this.\"\n\n\"Of course! That's why I'm having Mylo here make improvements to this orphanage as a whole. Improving the stairs to the village, building better paths, refurbishing the rooms. Jean even told me that the Matron tends to a garden - Mylo's company has an excellent landscaper. I've asked him to work on that as well,\" Goran responded.\n\nAs he was doing so he noticed a little boy, Kano, walk over shakily with a large pail of water in his hands.\n\nInitially, he assumed that the boy was just passing by, but Kano never turned away. He kept approaching them while carefully carrying the pail.\n\nThe boy stopped a foot away from the wall and placed the pail on the ground, causing droplets of water to spill over.\n\nThe boy heaved out loud and threw the water towards the wall.\n\n\"Boy, what are you doing?!\" Gavin bellowed. With a frantic wave of his palms, he materialised a large spell circle, suspending the mass of water just millimetres away from colliding against the wall.\n\nHe exhaled in relief and immediately jerked his hands back in a throwing motion, propelling the blob of water at an extremely high velocity in the opposite direction.\n\nKano gazed innocently at the agitated Goran and said, \"I'm cleaning the wall.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-104]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":115,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 102 - (Interlude) A Brewing Storm (Part Three)","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\nThe Plague Emperor snapped his fingers, and the body and the head of the shorter mage expanded drastically. Like an overfilled barrel, the mage exploded, sending bits and pieces of rotting flesh and gore everywhere. The dark blood spread out even further, reaching close to where the boy was hiding.\n\n'Just like mom!' The boy's eyes flashed as he witnessed this gruesome display. Except the mage's abdomen had exploded along with his head.\n\nHis eyes darted to the defeated figure of the Plague Emperor. Immeasurable anger was boiling from within him. The pain of losing his mother in such a brutal fashion had finally surfaced! He reached into his tattered trouser pockets and retrieved his blunt knife. It lacked a proper edge, but the little boy didn't care. He wanted the man to die a painful death by a thousand cuts!\n\nThe Plague Emperor closed his eyes and started to meditate. Slowly, his body started to shine with an ominous black aura. His skin started to boil and disintegrate at the same time. The boy who was observing this was startled once again. Unable to contain his curiosity, he revealed himself and walked towards the disintegrating figure.\n\nUpon approaching the figure, the boy saw that not only were the skin and flesh turning to dust, so were the bones. \n\nThe boy was an arm's length away from the Plague Emperor. He slowly raised the knife above his head and aimed it carefully so that in its descent, it would penetrate straight through the mage's eye sockets. \n\nThe boy knew that mages were strong, much stronger than average humans. He had also seen the phenomenal displays between the mages before. The boy knew that his chances of successfully taking this man's life were non-existent. But the boy didn't care!\n\nFrom birth, all the boy had in his life was his mother. She was the only constant throughout his tumultuous childhood. The only reason he wore a painful smile even as the family suffered was for her. He lived for her, just as much as she lived for him. So now that she was gone, what did he have to live for?\n\nSuddenly, the mage's eyes opened wide and locked onto the boy. Through instinctual fear, the boy leapt backwards and fell on his bottom. He expected the mage to exact a terrible vengeance on him, instead, the mages face started to melt off and immediately turned into dust at the same time.\n\nThe scene was frightening, to say the least. It occurred in layers: first, the surface epidermis turned porous and peeled off. Then the muscle underneath started to tear and disintegrate. The eyes went next, this one scarred the boy the most. Finally, it was the blood, which immediately steamed off, leaving just the skull.\n\nThe boy expected the skull to disappear too, but it didn't. The grim skull remained, emanating a threatening yet inviting aura. Enthralled by it, the boy reached forward and picked it up.\n\nHe turned the skull in his hands and brought it close to his face. As the skull's empty eye sockets lined up with his own. The boy was taken into a trance.\n\nHe was shown a vision! A terrible vision! Of a disease so devastating that the world itself shook in fear!\n\nThe Plague Emperor had died... Long live the Plague Emperor!\n\n____\n\nThe man's serene eyes burst open, and a wave of mana pulsed out. Although the man appeared calm on the surface, he was completely nonplussed and agitated. The room he was in was dark. The curtains were drawn in, and barely any light made its way through. Infrequent flickering green lamps tinged the room a dangerous shade, accentuating the terror within. \n\nThe room itself appeared to be a lab. There were cages of squeaking rats, hooks with flayed humans and beasts, vials and tubes of liquids pouring and bubbling, and a single bed-board with a shackled, naked and unconscious human male. \n\n\"Another failed introspection...\" The man muttered as he cracked his fingers. His deep dark eyes were laced with anger, that surprisingly failed to tinge his extremely pale, yet pleasing face.\n\nAfter releasing his pent up anger through additional waves of mana, he raised his body and hovered in place. With a glance, a fresh set of socks and shoes darted towards him and climbed up his feet. The one on the left weaved up effortlessly, however, the one on the right moved up more carefully as it avoided disturbing the charred, shrivelled foot.\n\nHe hovered forward, making it look as though he was walking, towards the sole pedestal in front of his meditation area and gazed deeply at the radiating skull placed on it.\n\n\"You should have at least left my mother alone,\" the man muttered threateningly towards the skull. \"She never did anything to you. Why infect her?\"\n\nHowever, the man already knew the answer. The advancement to the Tesseract Transformation realm was most perilous for a mage. The tribulation that one suffers through in this process can often lead the mage to do terrible things and/or suffer terrible damage.\n\nThe spell that turned his mother into a flesh-eating monstrosity was an accident. An unexpected release of magical power laced with an aura that the late Plague Emperor was most familiar and proud of. She just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nHowever, her death was imprinted into the boy's mind and had carried over into his adulthood. It was also the thing stopping him from advancing in his spiritual cultivation. Without doing so, he would be eternally stuck in the Core Condensation realm.\n\nHe had only made it so far, and that too so quickly, thanks to the skull from the man he hated so much. It was an inheritance artefact, one that encapsulated the terrible life and dreams of the living calamity, the Plague Emperor. Sure, he did have some support and benefit from his Teacher during his youth. But that was all a means to an end.\n\nAnd the end was to eliminate the greatest plague to this world, Mages.\n\n\"Idiots without brains using powers beyond their means to do unspeakable acts,\" the man muttered. \"Even the so-called righteous sects are just malicious entities publicised in a nice wrapper!\"\n\n\"They must all... disappear,\" he muttered resolutely with overflowing madness and anger in his eyes. In fact, his rage extended beyond just mages. To him, the entire world was a plague that needed purging. The only good in his life was taken from him. And for that, he would exact his revenge! An eye for an eye - he would take everything!\n\nThe man curled his palm into a shaking fist as his mind churned furious machinations. Right as his rage reached its peak a series of knocks at his door interrupted his momentum. Without waiting for an affirmation, it simply flung open and a regal-looking man walked with a disdainful frown on his face.\n\n\"Why haven't you made any progress yet, Ziva?\" The man interrogated. \"We've been bankrolling you and letting you do these grotesque experiments for years now! Was the Plague of Dark Cleansing your best?\"\n\nZiva Lune suppressed the urge to unleash unrelenting hell upon the miscreant right then and there. But he held himself back. The bastard was just a pawn, not worthy of sacrifice just yet. Everything would fall into place soon, he needed to be patient.\n\nZiva exhaled a long breath to centre his emotions and spoke up, \"It is getting harder and harder to do so, given that your monarch so eagerly publicised my affiliation with the kingdom.\"\n\n\"Humph! Excuses! You were the one who promised us you would take down that irksome Solar Empire once and for all. I remember exactly how you begged and grovelled on your knees,\" the man chortled in derision.\n\n'But then that imbecile of a King just had to go and open his mouth!' Ziva complained internally. As his emotions picked up again, the room started to undulate with unstable mana. Interestingly, the other man wasn't the least bit affected. Evidently, Ziva and this man were somewhat equally matched. The only thing diving them, of course, was political backing. The man, known simply as Maise, no last name, was the King's most loyal of dogs. So, he effectively had the backing of the monarch of the Blackstar Kingdom. On the other hand, although Ziva held the position of a sect leader it was only in name. There was literally no one else in the sect. No one wanted to be affiliated with or even approach the demon that unleashed the Plague of Dark Cleansing. A plague that had annihilated a region comparable to a small city and quite literally salted the fields, turning it into a veritable no man's land.\n\n\"I heard that you will be travelling to the Solar Empire as an ambassador?\" Ziva said in trying to change the topic.\n\n\"Yes. They're trying a new thing: Political Marriage. The ruler of the Solar Empire has gone soft, he wants to extend peace. Pssht! He's even willing to put the heads of one of his daughters on the chopping block in the name of peace! Can you believe that?\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Which one will they marry her off to?\"\n\nMaise paused as if hesitating and then answered, \"The Third Prince.\"\n\nOne must know that Maise was a horrible, horrible man. His hands were stained with the blood of both children and the elderly. If the King told him to take a life, he would do it no questions asked. He had tortured many who were deserving and many who weren't. However, he never took pleasure in it. It was simply work. But the Third Prince was different. That boy was twisted. The fact that just his mention gave even Maise pause spoke volumes of the Prince's cruelty.\n\n\"That's unfortunate,\" Ziva muttered.\n\n\"Anyways, what is it that you want?\" Maise retorted\n\n\"I want to try a different strategy. The mages of the empire have grown vigilant. Even a slight itch within their circle is met with a severity equalling the worst of plagues. This new strategy of mine is slower, but I believe that it can execute immense damage given time.\"\n\nAs Ziva spoke, he approached one of the cages with a rat in it and picked one out. After that, he moved towards his workbench and retrieved a phial that was bubbling with a greenish-black liquid. He extended a mote of his mana into the liquid and raised it skillfully. A multi-layered mana circle materialised in the hand controlling the liquid and started to encompass the liquid as a whole. The circle started spinning, causing the liquid to glow in the process. Skillfully, he plunged the tip of his ring and index finger right into the rat's abdomen and channelled the rotating liquid into it. The rat screeched in agony as the liquid, in its entirety, was siphoned into its tiny body.\n\nAfter a short minute, the liquid was completely drained, and the rat went into a hibernating state. Ziva quickly stuffed the rat into a transparent glass container and sealed it by activating the mana gem embedded above it. He handed the container to Maise and instructed, \"I want you to release this specimen somewhere secluded inside the empire. Preferably, it should be close to a place where a lot of mortals live. It shouldn't be close to a high foot traffic area though. So that means to avoid cities, especially the capital. The specimen needs to survive, so don't send it into perilous territories either.\"\n\nMaise nodded half-heartedly and waved Ziva away. He then extended his mana and held the sealed container suspended in the air a few metres away from him. Although Maise was scornful of Ziva, he respected the man's power. Maise did not want to be infected by whatever was residing within this unlucky rat.\n\nJust as Maise turned to leave, his eyes landed on a pedestal with a skull placed on it. Maise had seen it many times before, usually hanging around Ziva's neck or on his belt. However, those times, the skull simply appeared as a garish trinket and was often overlooked. Now though, there was an appeal to it. It felt special!\n\nAs his gaze started to grow increasingly fixated, Ziva immediately moved before him and blocked his line of sight.\n\n\"Do you want one too?\" Ziva asked casually as he picked up the skull from a pedestal. \"It's really helpful when you're trying to meditate. Helps you get into your own head,\" Ziva said while chuckling.\n\nMaise smirked disdainfully before turning to leave.\n\nZiva watched Maise's retreating back for a while before turning and embedding himself into his work. This time, he approached the unconscious male tethered to the bed-board and started to inject a series of needles at strategic points. Once the final needle pierced the man, the man suddenly opened his eyes and burst into agonising screams.\n\nHowever, they were cut short with a swipe of Ziva's hand. The man's vocal cords had been severed from within.\n\n\"Hush, now. I'm trying to work,\" Ziva muttered before continuing his torturous series of experiments.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-103]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":116,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 101 - (Interlude) A Brewing Storm (Part Two)","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\nThe two levitating individuals smirked and laughed at the kneeling man. In response, the man dabbed his lips with the sleeves of his dark green jacket and stood up straight.\n\n\"You two have made the gravest mistakes of your lives!\" The man threatened ominously with a low growl as he started to rise. Though he spoke with a low tone, his voice reverberated with palpable pressure.\n\nAfter he reached the same elevation as the two others, the ambience reached a standstill. No words were exchanged, only furtive glances. Yet, there was an increasing sense of tension radiating from the two. Even the boy, who lacked mana sensitivity, could feel it in his bones.\n\nSeconds turned to minutes, yet the three mages floating in the air barely moved a muscle. At least that's what the boy observed. In reality, the two blue-robed mages were sweating bullets. Although they knew that the man before them was injured and probably hanging on by a thread, the threat he emanated was real. He was the Plague Emperor, the living calamity! Even though he had just advanced to the Tesseract Transformation realm, the gap between their skills couldn't be overlooked.\n\nThe two exchanged a quick glance before they burst forth with a brilliant light. The taller mage materialised a spear, while the shorter mage had two daggers, one wielded in each hand. The taller mage stopped halfway between his starting point and the Plague Emperor and stabbed his spear forward. \n\n\"|Spear Art: Blue Flame Viper Strike|!\" The man bellowed.\n\nFrom the tip of the blade, an undulating whirl of blue flame started to snake out and twisted its way at an incredible speed. As it moved forward, the air around the area it passed through started to flicker causing hoops of plasma to materialise. The air seemed to physically separate as the flaming snake rushed forward, causing a heated hurricane of wind to push outwards and uprooting a few trees.\n\nThe blue flame snake jerked directly at the Plague Emperor's head, yet the man didn't flinch. Right as it was about to collide against him, the man flickered. The snake passed right through where the Plague Emperor's face was supposed to be. Just then, the shorter mage appeared behind the Plague Emperor and swiped his dual daggers in a scissoring motion.\n\n\"|Dagger Art: Sever Reality|!\"\n\nThe path the dagger followed turned a deep, dark blue. It didn't make any noise, however, it oozed with a dangerous power that could slice through matter and reality in and of itself.\n\nHowever, before it struck the Plague Emperor, the flickering man solidified in a flipped upside-down orientation. With two fingers in each hand, he effortlessly grabbed the volatile daggers, picking them perfectly with his elongated nails. The shorter mage faltered as he saw his ultimate move being dissipated so easily. Right as he did so, the Plague Emperor pulled the two daggers away causing the shorter mage to cross his hands and get pulled closer.\n\nThe Plague Emperor contracted his legs and pushed them forcefully against the shorter mage's belly. The shorter mage zoomed out into the horizon, causing a large sonic boom as his body receded. \n\nThe boy followed the hurtling man's trajectory and saw a small cliff in the distance crumble following a collision. He was shaken by how effortlessly the older man had achieved such a feat!\n\nMeanwhile, the Plague Emperor used the force to propel himself towards the other mage, while still flipped upside down.\n\nThe hurtling, overturned man started to spin his feet as he approached the taller mage. Immediately, a greyish-black aura started to coat his spinning legs, emanating an aura of malaise.\n\nThe tall mage quickly countered the attack by using his spear to parry the legs. The Plague Emperor used this parrying momentum to flip himself right side up and immediately stabbed forward with two fingers of his right hand. The elongated nails had changed colour and were also coated in greyish-black mana.\n\nThe close-quarter confrontation broke out so quickly, that the boy hiding behind the vines could barely keep up. \n\nThe elderly man kept a close distance against the taller mage. He knew that fighting further out would only be advantageous to the spear-wielder. This was the only way he could keep up the pressure. \n\nEvidently, it worked, as the taller mage was finding it increasingly harder to keep up the assault. On top of that, he had to remain wary to not get struck by the mana coated nails of the dastardly old man, lest he gets infected with whatever monstrous disease lay stored within.\n\nThe taller mage knew that underestimating the Plague Emperor was the last thing any mage could do. Many, stronger mages had tried to take on this man and had failed and suffered miserable deaths. That was why he decided to bring his Junior Brother along. The tall mage had stalked the Plague Emperor after he had heard rumours that the mage was finally attempting a realm advancement to Tesseract Transformation. Everyone knew that the strongest of mages were most vulnerable during this realm advancement. He had to take this chance! For glory! And to finally court his beautiful Master!\n\nBut how was he going to do all that if he died right now?\n\n'Where's Junior Brother?!' The taller mage thought frantically. The short distraction was sufficient for the vastly experienced Plague Emperor. He feigned a forward jab and flickered a low swipe with his mana coated nails.\n\n\"Humph! You've overplayed your hand, boy!\" The Plague Emperor berated. Just as the nails were about to pierce the taller mage, another voice bellowed.\n\n\"Not so fast!\" The shorter mage appeared right above the Plague Emperor and spun his body into a drop-kick.\n\nThe Plague Emperor's eyes widened as he saw the kick approaching him. For a brief moment, a sharp glint flashed across his eyes. He quickly crossed his arms above his head to block the kick.\n\nHe succeeded in doing so, however when his eyes lowered, he noticed that the taller mage had created distance between them again. \n\nThe taller mage spun the spear around rapidly. Incrementally, the spear started to glow a threatening red colour.\n\n\"|Spear Art: Knot of Flames|!\" he bellowed as he spun the spear in front of his body and seamlessly transitioned it above his head.\n\nInstantaneously, multiple undulating figures of flaming snakes gushed out from the spinning spear, which looked like a perilous portal. The area started to heat up like an oven as waves of plasma started to burst out around the snakes' paths. Much faster than before, the snakes attacked the Plague Emperor from all directions.\n\nThe Plague Emperor quickly grabbed the shorter mage above him and brought him in front to act as a shield. However, to his surprise, he saw the shorter mage smirk at him.\n\n\"A protection artefact?!\" \n\nAs though he were responding to the Plague Emperor's exclamation, the shorter mage yanked his head up and revealed a massive mana gem pendant around his neck.\n\n\"You've fallen for our trap, old man!\" The shorter mage scoffed. Before the Plague Emperor could respond, the flaming snakes all converged into him.\n\nThe snakes then circulated around the Plague Emperor forming a threatening knot, before constricting altogether.\n\nBOOM!\n\nAn earth-shattering explosion followed as a scorching heatwave spread out. Although the hidden boy managed to hide behind a tree, he was burned at his exposed right foot. It was a penetrating burn, that started to cause his foot to sizzle and shrivel. The boy immediately pulled his feet behind the tree and grit his teeth to bear through the pain. He shrunk his body deep into the tree as pulses of excruciating heat assaulted him incrementally.\n\nThe explosions kept coming in waves as snake after snake detonated.\n\nApart from the heat, the boy also had to bear through the pressure difference bearing down on him. He closed his ears in a desperate attempt to stop his eardrums from exploding. Right as he was on the verge of losing his life, the explosions stopped. The boy peeked out once again with great difficulty and noticed the figure of the elderly man hurtling towards the ground. The man's clothes appeared charred, however, his body was still in decent shape.\n\nThe two mages hovering above slowly descended and approached the fallen figure.\n\n\"So that's all that you can amount to, huh? The great Plague Emperor!\" The taller mage egged. As he carefully approached the prone figure, he spoke casually to the shorter mage behind him.\n\n\"Are you ok?\"\n\n\"The protective artefact from the Sect Leader worked!\" The shorter mage answered. However, near the end, there was visible strain and hoarseness in his voice. The mage coughed to clear his voice.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" The taller mage asked without taking his attention away from the Plague Emperor. His entire mana sense was focused on the figure to be wary of any suspicious actions.\n\n\"I *cough* I-\" the shorter mage cleared his throat.\n\nBut then the voice stopped. \"a...a...a...\" a hoarse voice emanated instead.\n\n\"Wha-\" Just as the taller mage turned his head, the shorter mage lunged at him and bit down on his throat.\n\n\"AAA!\" Was all the taller mage could scream out before his vocal cords were ripped from their place and slurped down by the pale-faced, dead-eyed, ferocious figure of the shorter mage.\n\nWhile the taller mage was in the Core Condensation Realm, the shorter mage was too. And after turning into whatever he was right now, his strength and mana proficiency were preserved. If one observed closely, the could see a clear film of mana lacing the teeth and nails of the short mage. Upon closer inspection, they could also observe the decay nature of this mana.\n\nYet, this wasn't enough to kill the taller mage in his entirety. His core was still intact!\n\nTo a limited degree, the core gains a level of autonomy once a mage enters the Core Condensation realm. After all, it is a literal dense mass of everything the mage has learned during their rigorous journey. In many ways, it is like a second brain!. The core within the taller mage's body animated automatically and started to slowly pull the body away. \n\nThe shorter mage was too preoccupied in chomping down on the brain matter exposed through the taller mage's cracked skull to notice this phenomenon. The headless body paused a little ways away from its head, as though reminiscing. Only then did it notice an interesting detail on its backstabbing comrade. It saw that there was a glaring injury along the shorter mage's calves. There were two distinct cuts that had turned black and rotten. It was the Plague Emperor's risky gambit!\n\nThe core didn't falter any longer and proceeded to lift the body out of the area.\n\nHowever before it moved by even a centimetre, a hurtling streak of black lightning struck the body right at the abdomen and shattered the core into pieces.\n\nThe boy who was observing this was so shocked he nearly screamed. Thankfully he caught himself in his actions. He traced the source of the lightning and saw that it had come from the Plague Emperor that everyone had assumed had died.\n\nThe elderly man groaned as he supported himself up. After getting seated. He looked at the gluttonous figure of the shorter mage sucking at the intestines of the corpse and clicked his tongue.\n\n\"My masterpiece...\" The man lamented. \"Sadly, this plague is fated to never see the light of day...\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-102]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":117,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 100 - (Interlude) A Brewing Storm (Part One)","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\n\"Be careful!\" The woman exclaimed with a helpless expression. She walked with a slight hunch, which wasn't helped by the fact that a massive basket was slumped over her shoulders, resting against her spine. Although she was only in her late twenties, her appearance was haggard and resembled someone who was well beyond. Her face contained many wrinkles and blemishes, possibly a result of poor skincare and overwork.\n\nThe person she called out to, a little boy carrying the same yet a more size-appropriate basket, stopped and turned to face her with a bright smile, \"Mom, hurry! The fungus I saw last time is this way. We need to get there before an animal eats it.\"\n\nThe boy appeared a bit malnourished for a six-year-old. However, his bright smile overshadowed it all, dousing the obvious suffering his body had gone through.\n\n\"*sigh* Slow down,\" the woman pleaded with a bitter smile. If anyone observed her carefully, they would notice a slight limp in the way she walked. After years of hard labour, damages had accumulated within the woman's body.\n\nThe boy noticed his mother's struggling expression and immediately relented, \"Umm. Why don't you wait here? I'll go fetch it real quick!\"\n\n\"Absolutely not! Although this part of the woods is relatively safe, I can't let you take a risk like this!\" The woman denied it immediately. The duo had traversed these woods for many months now and was thoroughly acquainted with the layout and the movement of fauna. The woman was sure that there wouldn't be any issues with letting the boy venture by himself. However, something inside her, possibly her instincts, warned her against it.\n\n\"But... But it's exactly what the magistrate was looking for,\" the boy pleaded. \"We could make a lot from this,\" he further reasoned.\n\nThe woman's firm expression faltered slightly as she pondered over her son's proposition. The mother and child lived alone. The woman's husband, and the child's father, had perished after getting conscripted into the army for a futile border dispute. It was futile because, after a few confrontations, nothing had changed. Apart from the razing of a few villages and the loss of a few lives, the border remained as it was. To top it all off, the woman didn't even learn of her husband's passing until three whole years had passed after the war ended. All that time, she lived in uncertainty. Not knowing if her husband was dead, or if he had abandoned them. Until one day, one man who revealed that he was her husband's comrade in the war arrived at their doorsteps and begged for forgiveness.\n\nHer husband and the man had volunteered to lay down their lives to let a small regiment retreat to safety during a confrontation with the opposing army. They believed that since they were the eldest in the whole regiment, it was their duty to shoulder the burden. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the man happened to survive after he feigned death following a strike from a sword. Her husband wasn't so lucky. Hearing the whole story, the woman cursed her husband. What valiance? What honour? Honour never paid the bills!\n\nNonetheless, left alone in this world with nothing to their name, the mother and son had to resort to menial labour to survive. Collecting wild plants, fruits and vegetables was their most recent venture. Usually, a regular trip such as this one would amount them maybe 5 to 8 copper coins on a good day. That was barely enough for one person to survive. Most of what she earned would go towards nurturing her son, the morsel that remained would be used to fill her.\n\nFinally, the woman released a defeated sigh and affirmed with a nod. \"But please... Please don't do anything stupid and be careful...\"\n\nThe boy vigorously in response. \"Just wait right here, mom! I'll be back in no time.\"\n\nThe boy received into the woods with a skip in his steps as he tried to trace back the path to the spore cluster he had found earlier. He was an intelligent boy with a sense of memory far beyond his years. He expertly navigated through the thickets and finally arrived at his destination, underneath a towering tree that rose up and above the canopies.\n\nNear the roots of the tree - the sections that snaked out from the soil - he saw the prospering spores he'd been searching for. The mushrooms were small and coloured a deep shade of brown. He'd heard of them before when lurking around in the marketplace. According to the intermittent conversations floating around there, he learned that these specific ones were highly sought after for their umami flavour, whatever that meant. After all the boy never ate for the taste, he ate to survive.\n\nThese were supposed to be extremely rare kinds of mushrooms because they grew in a very particular environment. But all that information wasn't of this kid's concerns. He just plopped down the basket hanging over his back and started to harvest them with a semi-blunt knife. One by one, the mushrooms were separated from their stems and were tossed into the basket. The kid wasn't overzealous with the harvesting. He knew that if he flooded the market with these mushrooms, he'd raise a few eyebrows. He knew better than to attract unwanted attention. So, after ensuring that he had only collected enough to satisfy the magistrate, the boy stopped.\n\nBefore he left, he moved a few barks from the tree trunks nearby, and a few fallen leaves to cover up the spores. Although these wouldn't completely dissuade wild animals from inspecting the area, he hoped that it would at least protect them from prying eyes.\n\nAs he started to make his way back, the boy suddenly felt an ominous and unsettling wave pass through him. The feeling made him sick to the core. Controlling the urge to vomit, the boy slowly supported himself by standing against one of the trees. After he caught his breath the boy investigated the area around him.\n\nAbruptly, the boy heard loud sounds coming from far in front.\n\n\"Mom!\" The boy exclaimed and rushed out. \n\nCompared to his earlier trip, the boy stumbled multiple times as he frantically avoided the underbrush and rocky protrusions along the ground. With each step closer to the source of the wave, he grew increasingly agitated and anxious.\n\nFinally, the boy broke through the woods and entered the clearing where he had separated from his mother. \n\n\"Mom!\" he called out towards the squatting figure of a woman, with her back towards him. Hearing the boy's call, the woman twitched her shoulders and jerked her neck.\n\n\"a...a...a...\" A gravelly voice escaped the woman's mouth as she rose with a mechanical jerk in her motion - it was like her joints had all dried up. The woman with a tilted head yanked her body in a 180-degree turn and faced the boy.\n\nAs soon as the boy's eyes fell on the woman's empty, bloodshot, and lifeless eyes, he took a step back and fell onto his bottom.\n\n\"M-Mom!\"\n\n\"Raaaa!\" The woman vocalised with a gravelly and rage-filled voice. She took an unstable step forward, and nearly fell over.\n\nThe boy shuffled back as he observed his mother approach him with an unfamiliar, predatory gaze. The look in her eyes mimicked that of a starving beast!\n\n\"M-Mom...\" The boy muttered out loud. \"W-Why are you acting like this?\"\n\nAlas, the woman didn't respond to him as he expected. All of a sudden, the woman jerked into a rapid crawling motion on all fours. She rushed towards him, mouth agape with her teeth exposed and with murderous eyes.\n\n\"AAAAA!\" The boy screamed out loud. He instinctively closed his eyes and fear overtook his subconscious. When faced with certain death, one often assumes that the only two options that one's instincts will default to are fight or flight. But this is only true if the instinct predicts even a minuscule chance of survival. Upon facing imminent and unchallengeable death, the body chooses that it is best to shut down and succumb as quickly as possible, to ensure minimum pain and suffering as death embraces it.\n\nRight before the woman's teeth approached the boy's exposed neck, it stopped. The boy opened his eyes and saw the woman he called mother before him. Her face had grown older within a short time. It had also grown paler and looked diseased. However, unlike the dead and beastlike eyes he'd gazed at before, there was life in them now! The boy could feel great sorrow within the eyes.\n\n\"Mom?\" He called out.\n\n\"S-Son... R-Run!\" The gravelly voice spoke with a warm intonation.\n\n\"Mom?\"\n\n\"R-RUN!\" The woman repeated.\n\nThe boy tried to scramble up, but his body failed to respond. He started to wail in fear and sadness as he tried to shift backwards. \n\nBefore he could create sufficient distance, the woman's eyes shifted again. With a hoarse, bloodthirsty shriek, the woman leapt at the boy.\n\nThe boy was once again preparing himself for his demise.\n\nHowever, it didn't come. Just a short second after the woman rushed at him, the boy heard a loud boom, then a pop, and then a tsunami of warmth collided against him.\n\nHe slowly opened his eyes and was assaulted by a horrific scene. Before him, lay the body of his mother... headless. Above her neck, black blood oozed out like a fountain. Around it and dangling over him was gore and bits of her rotting brain. The corpse twitched slightly before it turned completely limp, squirting out more blood in the process.\n\n\"Mom?\" The boy said through hiccups. He approached the body and turned it over. He verified that it was his mother, although he couldn't see her face. \n\nHe wanted to cry. But he could feel his emotions being blocked in place. There was just too much, and just too little space to allow it to flow through. It had all backed up.\n\nIt had all happened too quickly. His mind couldn't process it all...\n\nAs the boy gazed lifelessly at his mother's corpse he heard another boom, just like before. He followed the sound to its source subconsciously, but he made sure to hide as he did so.\n\n\"Tsk! So this is what is left of the great Plague Emperor?\" An arrogant voice pierced through from behind a hanging collection of vines.\n\n\"We knew that it was all just exaggeration. To think that the sect was scared of you?!\" Another arrogant voice chimed in.\n\nThe boy peeked through the vines to observe the hubbub. He separated a few hangers and saw an emaciated and dastardly looking old man keeling over and vomiting out black blood.\n\n\"PAH!\" The elderly man spat out with venomous anger. \"So much for the orthodox, HONOURABLE, sects! Attacking a mage while he is advancing in realms - aren't you ashamed?!\"\n\n\"HA! History is written by the victors. Who's going to know?\" One of the earlier voices retorted. The boy followed it and saw that it originated from a man floating around the height of the canopy. He was wearing a dark blue robe that reached up to his ankles. The boy could immediately tell that the man was extremely tall because his partner, who looked to be of average height, was completely dwarfed next to him.\n\nThe shorter partner was also a male and wore a similar get-up. However, for what he lacked in height he more than made up with his nigh flawless, chiselled appearance. The partner snorted and added, \"How else can two Core Condensation mages such as us stand up to a Tesseract Transformation realm mage? Sometimes, certain measures need to be taken. Now! It would be better for you to stand down and accept your death. We promise to make it quick and painless.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-101]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":118,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 099 - Prowling for Some Petals","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n\"The wheels on the cart go round and round, round and round, round and round.

Clop! Clop!\", all day long!\"\n\nA melodious voice pierced through the eerie silence of the dark forest. Tiny animals all moved out from their hiding places and retreated further into the shadows as the thundering skips of the little girl navigated through the claustrophobic woods.\n\nInterestingly, the little girl didn't seem the least bit perturbed or unnerved by the growing eeriness and the unwitting threat that arose from exploring the unknown. Because this wasn't the first time Dora had made such a hazardous expedition into the forest, and it most likely wouldn't be her last.\n\nOne must wonder, what was such an innocent and lovely little girl doing so deep in these necks of the woods? It was to search for different varieties of flowers of course! Having sourced a plethora of different daisies, roses, lotuses, lilies and tulips, Dora was out on the prowl for some wildflowers! The kind that grew in the most precarious of places.\n\n\"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King's horses and all the King's men, couldn't put Humpty together again!\" The girl yelped excitedly.\n\n\"Hmmm... Was Humpty the King? And how can you put someone back together again? Does it mean to heal him?\" The girl muttered with a pout as she skipped over a fallen trunk.\n\n\"Now! Last time I went...\" She inspected the trunk for any marks and noticed a few faded lines that seemed to have been scratched on by a rock.\n\n\"...that way! So let's go this way today!\" With a direction in mind, Dora resumed her bouncy skips while humming out tunes from the different rhymes Teacher Larks had taught her.\n\nIt had been less than a week since her first personal lesson with Teacher Larks, and for the past few classes, all she and Teacher Larks had been doing was practising this freaky set of stretching exercises called Yoga.\n\nDora's cheeks flushed in embarrassment as she recollected the event which transpired when she first attempted the Downward Dog Pose! That goodness Teacher Larks took the blame in her stead, otherwise, she would have been so ashamed to show her face in front of Big Brother Markus and Medium Sis Jean.\n\nOh, right! Now that Dora had another elder sister, she had to come up with a new way to address this person. Dora already had a Big Sis - Marie - so she couldn't refer to her with that title, otherwise, it would confuse everyone. The only logical solution turned out to be Medium Sis since Jean was younger than Marie, yet elder to Dora.\n\nDora really liked Medium Sis. She wasn't as talkative as Big Sis, but she would help Dora out a lot, especially when it came to selecting the right flowers. One time, Dora accidentally grabbed onto an Itching Lily and squirted the juice from its stem all over her hands and face. Thankfully Medium Sis was close-by and soothed the itching by using a powder made from the petals of the flower itself. After that day, Dora would often consult Medium Sis about different flowers she would find.\n\nSometimes, Dora would ponder if it would be cool to take Medium Sis to Fancy's Garden...\n\n\"I should ask Fancy's permission first,\" Dora muttered to herself.\n\nAnyways, thanks to learning Yoga with Teacher Larks, Dora was experiencing certain changes in the way her mind worked. Although she wasn't mature enough to recognise the exact magnitude of these changes, she was perceptive enough to notice them.\n\nFirst, Dora could now voluntarily tune out and tune into the multitude of voices and sounds echoing around her. By focusing her mind on her breath, and the physical movement of her chest, Dora could filter out the different sounds assaulting her senses and incrementally negate their effects. It was an arduous process and required her to maintain her focus. However, according to Teacher Larks, it would become easier the more she practised it.\n\nDora snapped her fingers and halted in place as she remembered something. She closed her eyes and started to take long and measured breaths to calm her quick heartbeats. \n\n'Inhale... Exhale...' Dora repeated internally. Little by little, the world around her started to grow sharper in her senses.\n\n\"HUT! TWO! THREE! FOUR! ....Hut! Two! Three! Four!.... hut! two! three! four!.... ...!...!...!...!\" The march of the insects beneath her feet quietened down gradually.\n\n\"MINE! MINE!... Mine! Mine!... mine! mine!... ...!...!\" The argumentative din of the birds in the tree branches became smothered incrementally.\n\n\"It stopped!... Smells healthy!... Flank!\"\n\n\"Huh?!\" Dora snapped out of her meditative state and swivelled her head around.\n\n\"Stop!... Did it notice?... Move low!\"\n\n\"Who?-\" Dora squinted her eyes and focused her senses as far as they could see.\n\n\"Converge slowly!\"\n\n\"That!\" Dora's eyes finally caught onto an undulating carpet of fur approaching her at a measured pace.\n\nWithout wasting a second of thought, Dora grasped onto the trunk of the tree next to her and started to scramble up expertly. It wasn't her first time monkeying up such precarious trees after all - her search for beautiful flowers had carried her to even more dangerous heights.\n\n\"Quick! It is getting away!!!\" The low carpet of fur rose with a jerk, revealing rows of massive fangs capable of tearing through flesh and tendons, and crushing bones, and two predatory eyes that locked onto Dora's rising back.\n\nBARK! ROAR! BARK!\n\nFour more canines rose from equally spaced angles surrounding Dora's tree and converged towards her with massive leaps.\n\n\"Wolves!\" Dora exclaimed in surprise as she found a foothold at a split in the trunk sufficiently high so that the beasts below couldn't reach her.\n\n\"Get down here! Catch her! Jump!\" Five massive canines lead by a physically larger mutt bellowed towards her hungrily while each tried their best to leap towards her.\n\nDora sighed in relief that she had taken the time to temper her mind, otherwise she feared that she would have missed these five killers stalking her. Internally, she thanked Teacher Larks a hundred times.\n\nThe hungry carnivores didn't seem willing to let go of her just yet. The leader of the pack place its front legs over one of its comrades and started to reach higher by moving its hind legs on top. Fortunately, the subordinate collapsed under the added weight of the bulkier alpha, causing the mounted canine to fall unceremoniously.\n\nThe splayed alpha snapped and condemned the failure of a subordinate and called on to the next member.\n\n\"Sit on your belly! You, sit on top of him! I will stand on top of your two and jump!\"\n\nDora grew increasingly concerned at this outcome as the alpha was showing the capacity for complex thoughts and intelligence. Fancy had told her about such cases, and it was a clear sign that beast was about to evolve into a magical creature. Fancy had taught Dora the arcane process by which this change took place, but Dora couldn't recollect the exact details.\n\nPanicking, Dora started to scream at the top of her lungs, \"Fancy! Help!\"\n\nHer voice was immediately drowned out by the barks of the wolves underneath her. At this point, Dora was starting to get scared.\n\n\"Fancy! Please! Help!\" She tried again.\n\nHowever this time, the alpha beneath leapt up and snapped its maw shut, barely inches away from where her foot lay.\n\n\"Aaah!\" Dora shrieked as she retreated her appendage and tried to scramble higher up the tree. However, the trunk wasn't as segmented as the ones near the periphery of the forest. She couldn't reach higher!\n\n\"Fancy!\" Dora screamed again, tears brewing from her eyes and rolling down her scarlet cheeks.\n\nThe alpha jumped again! This time, it managed to grasp at the hem of her skirt tearing off a small chunk.\n\n\"Aaah! FANCY!!!\"\n\nWOOOSH!\n\nA pleasant gust of wind, washed in a translucent coat of white, swept over the section of the forest. The flowing powdery smog barely rose above the ground level.\n\nThe wolves snarling beneath the tree inhaled the powder and sneezed vehemently.\n\nOne by one, the canines started to collapse like ragdolls.\n\nThe bulky alpha was last to submit. It held out for as long as it could, trying to power through the drowsy feeling creeping over it that started from its spine. But ultimately, it was still too weak. It felt weak. It fell... asleep.\n\nSeeing the hungry beasts collapse, Dora released a sigh of relief amidst her tear-filled hiccups.\n\n\"Fancy! Hic! You came!\" Dora started to descend, however, she was stopped. \"Don't come down yet!\"\n\n\"Huh? Why not?\"\n\nRight as she asked, the wind picked up once again, and the powdery residues peppering the area were picked up and displaced. After a short minute, an elegant and vibrant insect fluttered from amidst the weaving treeline and settled atop the literal dog pile.\n\n\"You can come down now!\"\n\n\"Hic! Okay!\" The girl uttered and started to cautiously lower herself. After gaining firm footing on the forest floor, the girl rushed over to the insect and wept in relief.\n\n\"Huunn! Hic! Fancy! I was so scared....\"\n\n\"Then why are you in this part of the woods again? I told you to be careful!\" The insect reprimanded.\n\n\"B-But I came here searching for flowers for you,\" The girl reasoned as she rubbed her cheeks with her cuffs.\n\n\"*sigh* I have enough. You should stop getting into trouble, Dora,\" The insect said as she landed on top of the girl's head.\n\n\"Now go back. I will take care of this mess,\" The insect instructed.\n\n\"W-Wait! What are you going to do to them?\" The girl retorted with a cautious frown.\n\n\"I'm going to get rid of them.\"\n\n\"Don't... kill them,\" Dora pleaded in a low voice.\n\nThe insect's wings fluttered in amusement, \"Why not? They tried to kill you.\"\n\n\"But they were just following their instincts. They were hungry, and I was-\" the girl smiled wryly and continued, \"-food.\"\n\n\"Besides! You won't eat them, so why kill them?\" The girl reasoned.\n\nThe insect fluttered in place as though in contemplation, and replied, \"Fine. I'll let them go. But I will warn the big one after it wakes up... just to be safe.\"\n\n\"Okay!\" Dora smiled. \"Oh! How did you make them fall asleep?\" She asked.\n\n\"Sleep powder,\" The insect replied as it materialised a small mound of sparkling powder in one of its wings.\n\n\"Don't come closer!\" Fancy warned as Dora subconsciously brought her face closer to inspect the pile.\n\n\"Can I take some with me? Just for protection?\" Dora asked cautiously.\n\nAfter some hesitation, the insect complied seeing as the girl would never truly give up her adventurous spirit.\n\nDora immediately reached into her bag and pulled out a phial filled with the itch-treating powder Medium Sis had made for her. She emptied the phial and scooped up a large mound of the sleep powder from Fancy's wings. After carefully closing it shut, Dora retreated the way she came with the same bouncy skip in her steps.\n\nAfter the girl was clear of the area, Fancy immediately materialised another kind of powder and splashed it over the sleeping wolves.\n\nWHIMPER!\n\nThe group yelped as they gained clarity. The alpha staggered up with shaky steps and growled drowsily at the blurry image of a tiny insect.\n\n\"Who are you!\"\n\n\"Shut it!\" Fancy snapped back and splashed another powder over the pack.\n\nThe alpha started to contort in pain after in inhaled this powder and squirmed like a worm doused in salt.\n\n\"Make it stop!\" The animal pleaded.\n\n\"I will... Just not yet,\" Fancy replied ominously.\n\nA harmony of whines, howls, whimpers and yelps resounded from the forest and painted the forest in an eery gloom, discouraging any new explorers from stepping in. \n\nThe wailing sounds lasted through the entire night. Stopping only when the first sliver of sunlight made its way through the canopy and fell on the forest floor.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-100]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":119,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 098 - Dora Reva","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nDora vocalised her issue hesitantly. \"It's not that I don't want to focus... It's just... there are too many things around me calling for my attention.\"\n\nGuy followed up with a few questions to narrow down the true cause of the girl's problems. After realising that developmental disorders were present in this world, through diagnosing Kano's dyslexia, Guy raised his perceptivity to possible outcrops of any other similar problems amongst his wards.\n\nNow, Guy initially assumed that Dora was suffering from ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus. It also affects their capacity to control their impulsive behaviours. Many of the girl's actions and mannerisms pointed towards it as being the cause.\n\nHowever, through questioning her, Guy realised that his hypothesis may not be completely true.\n\n\"So by other things calling for your attention, you literally mean other things CALLING for your attention?\" Guy repeated in disbelief, to which the girl nodded vehemently.\n\n\"Can you give me an example?\" Guy asked.\n\nDora pursed her lips and hummed in contemplation. After a short pause, she pointed at a faraway branch of a tree and said, \"That bird keeps saying weird things. Like \"Witness me!\", \"Observe my vibrant tailfeathers!\", and \"Show yourself, you saucy wench!\"\n\nDora frowned and asked with an innocent expression, \"What does \"Let this magnificent one betow his virile seed upon thee!\" mean?\"\n\nGuy's face contorted with distress and urgency. He quickly spun up a |Gust| spell and flung it towards the branch in question, causing a plush bird to stumble out and fly away.\n\n\"Now it's saying \"Which interloper dare disturb this magnificent one? Come out and kowtow three times before me, or face my undying wrath!\" Dora translated the retreating chirps.\n\n\"You can understand their speech?\" Guy asked in surprise.\n\n\"Ummm,\" The girl scratched her chin as though she were struggling with an explanation. \"It does feel the same way as talking with other people. With these animals, it just makes sense. Inside, I just know what they want to tell me.\"\n\n\"And you're finding it difficult to filter out these... voices?\" Guy probed. The girl affirmed with loud nods and exhaled in relief.\n\n\"Hmm... Why haven't you told this to anyone else?\"\n\nDora wore a bitter expression and answered, \"I tried... But they just thought that I was making excuses.\"\n\n\"You didn't tell your family either?\"\n\n\"No... I was afraid they would think the same...\"\n\nGuy sighed in distress. \"You poor girl...\" he muttered under his breath. He didn't expect Dora to have such a deep chip on her shoulders.\n\nBut what bothered Guy, even more, was the fact that her problem was a bit beyond his level of understanding. Sure, Guy was trained to handle most normal developmental disorders, learning disabilities, and childhood mental illnesses. However this! Would this even qualify as a disorder, disability or illness? If anything, this seemed to be more of an ability and Guy was severely underinformed to make any assumptions and/or conclusions on the matter.\n\nYet the problem remained. Dora's so-called gift was also hindering her from pursuing tasks she was interested in.\n\nGuy gestured for Dora to take a seat, and he himself slumped down into his own. Guy retreated into the RoK and sought out any books he could find that may aid him in the matter. Due to the limits imposed by Mast regarding the access to some of the books, Guy could seek out highly technical and research focussed literature, as they were apparently too advanced. However, some of the more commercial literature catering to self-help and so on were accessible.\n\nThus, Guy picked as many of them that fit his search parameters and started to scan through them. All though it had been some time since he read these books, the gist of their content was ingrained into his mind, so there was little time wasted in chasing down false leads.\n\nWhile Guy was perusing the books, Markus had arrived with lunch. He handed Dora's share to her and placed Guy's in front of his Master, who was sitting still with a blank expression. Markus had seen his Master enter this state many times before, so he chose not to disturb him.\n\nUnfortunately, Guy didn't exit the state for at least an hour, causing the lunch to turn cold. Markus frowned and proceeded to remove the cold food, but he was stopped by his Master who just happened to exit his checked-out state.\n\n\"It's alright! I can still eat it,\" Guy said.\n\n\"But Master, it's cold. Let me at least warm it up?\" Markus replied.\n\nGuy activated a custom spell that started to both simultaneously circulate and heat the air above the food. Gradually the food items started to heat up under the convective current.\n\n\"There! All done!\" Guy exclaimed and scarfed down the contents in large gulps.\n\n\"Dora! Let's go!\" He called out after finishing his food.\n\nRight as he stood up, Jean arrived as it was time for their session on theory and application of magic.\n\nGuy clicked his tongue in realisation, and quickly said, \"Markus! I want you to get started with Jean and gauge her current level of understanding. If she is a complete newbie, start by going through the basic curriculum you covered back at the Academy. She needs to have a thorough understanding of manipulating and shaping mana. She must also understand the theories pertaining to the properties of mana.\"\n\nMarkus nodded in affirmation and pulled Jean over.\n\nGuy called Dora to an open area and told her to wait there. He then went back into the orphanage and brought out two large woven mats from the storage. He unrolled them and placed them three arm's length away from each other.\n\nHe sat down in a lotus position on one of the mats and gestured for Dora to do the same on the other.\n\n\"From today onwards, every morning before your lessons, I want you to come out here and practice the following set of exercises with me. The problem you are facing right now is narrowing your focus to contain only one task and one goal. The issue is that your senses are receptive to a plethora of inputs all at once, and your mind is finding it difficult to grasp onto them one at a time.\"\n\nThrough his quick research Guy was directed to one solution, meditation. There have been many studies on the benefits of meditation and how it can affect a human being's mind. Although these publications were outside Guy's limits in the RoK, he still had access to the commercial texts that condensed this into bitesize chunks.\n\nGuy realised that by teaching Dora to meditate, not the kind used to replenish mana, he could train her to compartmentalise the inputs assaulting her senses. However, standard meditation was simply too boring.\n\nIn fact, this wasn't Guy's first attempt in introducing meditation into children's daily schedules. He had tried many times before in his past life and failed in the process. Finally, through repeated trials and errors Guy found out the most optimal method. Though this wasn't guaranteed to succeed, there was a higher probability of it sticking.\n\nAnd this method was by practising Yoga.\n\nIn the modern age, this practice which originated in ancient India had evolved into a form of physical and mental exercises seeking to centre the mind, build core strength, and improve overall well-being. There were many theories, techniques and variations of this form that could be applied to a variety of different cases.\n\nHowever, Guy simply sought this out for the purpose of tempering his students. It was a healthy practice that didn't take a lot of time, nor did it take a lot of investment. Anyone could practise it and enjoy its results, and it also doubled as an effective form of meditation. There were many health benefits to Yoga, and Guy took some time during his later years to learn it for the purpose of propagating it.\n\nAlthough he couldn't say that he was an expert in Yoga, Guy was trained in it to a sufficient degree to tailor the exercise from person to person.\n\n\"What we will be practising is called Yoga. It is a meditation exercise the trains both the mind and body. Before we begin, we will first stretch so that our body is loosened up.\"\n\nAlthough Yoga was inherently a stretching based exercise, it was safest to warm up the muscles to reduce any unwanted consequences. This was especially important since the practitioner in question was a little girl.\n\nGuy expertly cycled through a sequence of stretches, the first half of which were all grounded. Dora had some trouble replication some of the more complex stretches such as the \"Eye of the Needle Pose\". In those cases, Guy personally showed her the correct positioning and the intended outcomes. Each time Guy showed her a new pose, he would explain what the targeted muscles or segments were and how they should feel. The girl didn't understand the terminology in the beginning, however, through repetition and application she started to hum and nod along affirmatively.\n\nAfter going through the stretches. Guy began by displaying the first 5 sets of poses Dora needed to master.\n\n\"This first pose that you need master is the Child's Pose. Think of it as a resting position that you can move through before attempting another more difficult pose. While you are doing this, you need to breathe measuredly, not hurriedly. And always focus on your breaths!\"\n\nGuy displayed the pose using his body and then asked Dora to replicate it. The Child's Pose was inherently easy and she didn't have much trouble repeating it. However, there were still a few deviations that Guy corrected while calmly drawing Dora's attention to her own breath.\n\n\"Never deviate your attention from your breath. Feel it as it enters your lungs, and feel it as it gushes out through your nostrils. If you're finding it hard to do so, try to find a fixed point in your gaze and keep it firmly within your attention.\"\n\nAfter ten breaths, Guy moved on to the next pose, The Cat-Cow Pose.\n\n\"This is an alternating pose. We start on all fours...\"\n\nGuy displayed the sequence slowly and asked Dora to replicate him. After adjusting her body, Guy moved her through the inhaling and exhaling regime. \"The goal is to loosen the spine and back. Don't rush through it, slow and steady, slow and steady.\"\n\n____\n\n\"Cantrips are a good way to gain a decent understanding of how mana circulates through the body during spell casting. One thing I want you to focus on this time is where the mana circulation starts- Jean, are you listening?\" Markus said while snapping his fingers in front of a distracted Jean.\n\n\"Uh? Sorry Senior Brother, I got a little distracted,\" Jean quickly apologised.\n\nMarkus followed Jean's gaze and observed his Master and Dora moving through a bunch of mundane gestures and poses on a mat.\n\n\"What is Teacher Larks doing?\" Jean inquired during the pause.\n\n\"I... don't know,\" Markus confessed with a loud exhale. \"Master is very... well-informed. What may come across as nonsensical shenanigans often hide vast and boundless insights.\"\n\nRight as Markus finished the statement, his Master and Dora both entered a pose in which they raised their bottoms upwards and held their bodies in a triangular shape with the floor.\n\nPRRRRT!\n\n\"Uh oh! Sorry about that!\" Guy exclaimed with loud laughter.\n\n\"T-Teacher Larks...\" The little girl said with a flustered expression.\n\n\"Sorry about that you guys! That was my bad!\" Guy then apologised to Markus and Jean and continued explaining the pose to the now crimson Dora.\n\n\"Isn't Teacher Larks in Foundation Establishment realm?\" Jean questioned in a low tone to Markus.\n\nMarkus hummed in affirmation.\n\n\"Then shouldn't his body not produce any waste?\" She added.\n\nMarkus hummed once again.\n\n\"Then?...\"\n\n\"He's saving someone else from embarrassment,\" Markus replied as he shook his head with a faint smile.\n\n____\n\nGuy brushed off the incident as if it never happened and continued instructing the girl, amidst her obvious embarrassment. Eventually, her mind centred itself as she entered a deep trancelike state.\n\nIt looked as though the exercise was a success. Dora exhaled a long breath as she terminated the final pose and gazed out with a calmer, less erratic, expression.\n\n\"I-I don't hear them anymore!\" Dora exclaimed with a low mutter. Multiple small fireworks exploded in the girl's mind as a sense of relief washed over her. This feeling... It was new... And satisfying!\n\n\"Don't get so excited now. This is only temporary. You will have to keep practising this if you want to maintain this state of mind.\"\n\nAlthough the girl now had improved clarity, she didn't hear a single word Guy said. She was too distracted to appreciate the silence around her.\n\nShe quickly rubbed her eyes with her sleeves and leapt into Guy's arms while sniffling.\n\n\"Thank you! Teacher Larks!\"\n\nWhile Guy was caught up in the sudden turn of events, Mast interjected in his mind, (You have your fourth student now.)\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-099]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":120,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 097 - A New Addition","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nFollowing the morning session with his magically inclined students, and Marie, Guy took a quick break within the RoK to formulate his lesson plan for his regular students.\n\n(You've secured your third student,) Mast commented as he instantaneously materialised next to Guy.\n\n'Just three?' Guy muttered in confusion. He falsely assumed that Marie would have been tagged as the fourth student. Apparently, the girl was still unconvinced about Guy's capacity as a teacher.\n\n'Makes sense. She should probably be a little miffed about me denying her from learning magic,' But Guy wasn't planning to bend on his stance. He firmly believed in his approach of forming a mature goal before embarking on the path of magic. Call it paranoia, but he had read way too much casual online literature in which characters turned into rogue, mass-murdering monsters after amassing unbelievable power. Basically, Guy didn't want to play a role in unwittingly raising the next magical murderhobo.\n\n'No matter. If she is meant to be, then she is meant to be. I can't force it,' He uttered to assuage himself.\n\nFollowing that, he resumed his preparations in earnest. One of the best parts about catering to a younger age group was the beautifully excessive amount of colours present within their educational material. When it came to kids, maintaining their attention for an elongated period was the most common challenge faced by educators. Over time, experts in the field deduced optimal methods to improve the assimilation of knowledge amongst kids, and the most prevalent and straightforward solution was to increase the vibrancy of each page to grasp the kids' fleeting attention.\n\nApart from that, there was also the moderation of content on each page. Kids' minds aren't developed enough to comprehend most abstract and out-of-the-way topics that could easily be absorbed by children of a higher age group. However, on modern Earth, due to the rapidly growing quantity of knowledge deemed compulsory, it was imperative to inculcate some of the abstract concepts into the kids so that they could understand the more complex topics at a later stage.\n\nFor instance, referring to an earlier topic, programming and coding wasn't something deemed necessary for children to dabble in, during their schooling in the 80s and 90s. It was only during the early 2000s and onwards, when technology become more accessible and ubiquitous, that the subject started to encroach into the school curriculum. Later on, around the time of Guy's passing, it was even taught in primary schools as an optional or extra-curricular topic.\n\nIn some places, primary school children were also being introduced to Arduino (micro-controller) or LEGO MINDSTORMS platforms for hardware programming!\n\nAlas, while Guy would have enjoyed bringing the joy of building basic robots and doo-dads with the children under his tutelage in this world, the technology here just hadn't advanced far enough to accommodate such endeavours. Furthermore, Guy couldn't do anything to make up for it since he wasn't knowledgeable in the pertinent fields to spearhead such projects by himself.\n\nAfter he was satisfied with his work, Guy retreated from the RoK with a set of printed books in his hands.\n\nUpon his re-entry into the real world, Guy was surprised to notice two children already in his classroom. The presence of one, Kano, wasn't a surprise to Guy as the kid basically lived here. However, Guy was interested in the attendance of the boy's fraternal twin, Dora.\n\nGuy didn't have many interactions with the girl following his lodging in the orphanage. More often than nought, the girl would flee upon his approach. For some reason, she was exceedingly cautious in interacting with Guy. However, Guy also noticed that when it came to interacting with other more familiar people, the girl was unbelievably extroverted.\n\n\"Kano! You're early!\" Guy said with an inviting gesture. The boy returned with a dazzling smile and approached Guy with a massive book in his hands.\n\nAfter some deep consideration, Guy had decided to bring out \"The Hobbit - or There and Back Again\" for Kano to peruse. Although the boy hadn't fully solidified his reading capacity, he was constantly in a thirst for more. So, Guy decided to foist \"The Hobbit\" onto the boy to devour at a slow and steady pace.\n\n\"Good morning, Teacher L-L-Larks!\" The boy greeted.\n\nGuy shifted his gaze towards the shy girl twisting in place a few steps behind Kano and waved at her, \"Good morning Dora.\"\n\nDora jerked and returned the greeting, \"Good morning, Teacher Larks!\"\n\n\"So what's up?\" Guy responded.\n\n\"Teacher Larks, Dora wants to join in on the lessons,\" Kano requested. \"Is that okay?\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't it be okay? Dora is this what you want?\"\n\nWith a low mutter, Dora answered, \"Y-yes...\"\n\n\"Alright. Since it is your first class with me, why don't you sit up front with Kano?\" Guy said while pointing her towards the desk closest to the blackboards.\n\nIn response, the girl meekly followed Kano and assumed the seat.\n\nKano dropped his massive book on the desk and started to read from where he left off, his pointer finger drifting at a snail's pace over the lines on the text and his lips oscillating through sounds with each new word. Dora on the other hand sat in place for a while, her gaze locked on the page Kano was currently at.\n\nAfter a while, it drifted off to a rustling tree branch a little ways behind the blackboard. It didn't stay there for long though, because almost immediately, it was drawn to a line of ants soldiering next to her seat. A few seconds after, it went towards the page Kano turned to.\n\nFinally, it locked on to the eyes of Guy who was staring intently at her and observing her every action. Dora noticed his gaze and embarrassedly looked down into her hands, receiving a low chuckle from Guy in the process.\n\nRight at that point, Dora heard the sounds of familiar voices and light footsteps coming towards the classroom.\n\n\"Durkas I wanna see Sparky too!\"\n\n\"She just returned, you guys. I'll let you see her some other time.\"\n\n\"Awww,\"\n\nThe kids filed into the class, greeting Guy as they did, and sat down at their usual seats.\n\n\"Huh? Dora? What are you doing here?\" Durkas asked. He was surprised that someone else was sitting in his usual spot.\n\n\"Dora will be joining us from today. Can you please sit somewhere else, Durkas?\" Guy asked, to which the child nodded and moved to a seat a row back.\n\nThe classroom settled down and the conversations died down after Guy walked up and made his presence known.\n\n\"Since we have a new student with us today, I want to go through everything we have covered till now as a recap,\" Guy declared.\n\n\"Let us start with 'Parts of Speech'. Durkas, would you like to list them out for us?\"\n\nDurkas stood up and orated, \"Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Adjective, Article, Adverb, Preposition, Conjunction and Interjection are the 9 main parts of speech.\"\n\n\"Good! Lori, can you give explain what a Noun is?\"\n\nA girl sitting next to Durkas stood up and answered, \"A noun is a person, place, animal, or thing.\"\n\n\"Good job! Rhine, can you give us an example of a noun?\"\n\n\"Rhine!\" The boy in question exclaimed while pointing to himself, eliciting an array of laughter from the class.\n\n\"That is correct,\" Guy commended with a chuckle. \"Can you tell me if that is a proper or a common noun?\"\n\nThe boy tilted his head and contemplated it for a while. \"Proper noun?\" He answered with an unsure elongation in his tone.\n\n\"Who else agrees with Rhine?\" Guy extended the question to the entire classroom. In response everyone else raised their hands, causing the boy to exhale in relief.\n\n\"Good job, Rhine!\" Guy added.\n\n\"Alright, who can explain what a pronoun is?\" Guy continued the discussion. As he did so, he kept his attention trained on Dora, to observe her reactions. In the process, Guy discovered that the girl's attention span was incredibly flighty. She was focused on the discussion one minute, and the next she was following a distant sound emanating from a bush nearby.\n\nGuy wasn't the least bit offended or annoyed by this. After all, he had done his due diligence before and had heard of the girl's troubles from the previous elderly tutor.\n\nIn fact, Guy had anticipated the girl's participation in his classroom from the very beginning. To that end, he had even formulated methods to assist the girl in her ventures, given that she was interested in learning in the first place.\n\nTherefore, Guy's primary goal today was to figure out if she was motivated or not. And Guy confirmed that Dora was definitely responsive to learning, based on the repeated flashes of irritation showing on her face every time she realised that her attention had deviated.\n\nGuy did not want to bring this up in front of the class and discourage the girl, since he knew that she was already reprimanding herself internally. Drawing attention to it publicly would only shame her further and dissuade her to the point of giving up. With that in mind, Guy continued the class till the very end.\n\nOnce the session was finished, the group of kids filed out while continuing their earlier conversations.\n\nKano also rose from his seat and closed his book, leaving a dry leaf on the last page he was at to act as a bookmark.\n\nDora also stood up with a dejected frown on her face. However, before she could leave Guy called out to her, \"Dora! Can you please stay back for a moment?\"\n\nDora bit her tongue and sucked in a long breath of cold dry air. She had hoped that Teacher Larks had overlooked her frequent transgressions during class. However, it seemed that her hopes were unanswered.\n\n\"How did you find the class?\" Guy continued.\n\nDora's eye's flickered around as she searched for words. Yet before she could voice her thoughts, Guy asked, \"Were you having difficulty concentrating?\"\n\nThe girl shrunk herself in preparation for a scolding, however, what followed befuddled her completely.\n\n\"Can you please explain your problem to me? Is the subject boring?\"\n\n\"N-No! That's not it...\" Dora interjected immediately.\n\n\"Then?\" Guy asked with visible concern.\n\nDora stuttered as her mind processed the unusual turn of events. She had expected a fierce reprimand like with the elderly tutor, yet what transpired was the exact opposite! She didn't think that her infraction would be met with worry, as opposed to the usual animosity.\n\nAfter taking a while to centre herself, Dora spoke up meekly.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-098]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":121,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 096 - Learning by Teaching","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nGuy's intention with a preliminary assessment was to understand the breadth of his student's basics. Without a standardised curriculum for education, Guy needed to understand how much Jean and Marie knew already, and to what extent their prowess was in those topics. While Guy didn't mind teaching them only on an individual basis, the strategy wasn't scalable. As his class strength increased it would be more efficient to first establish a baseline as a starting point and then build up from there.\n\n\"The first topic I want to test everyone on is Mathematics. I am sure that both of you must have already covered basic arithmetics. I want to know how far your knowledge extends beyond that. Attempt as many questions as you can. The questions grow increasingly harder as you progress, so stop if you can't go any further,\" Guy instructed.\n\nThe two girls nodded seriously and turned open the first page of the workbook. Marie went to work on the question quickly, without a moment of thought. Jean on the other hand worked at a measured pace. By the time Marie started on the second question, Jean had just begun answering the first.\n\nGuy didn't bother micromanaging the two, and let them go about their business. He sat down at his desk up front and began compiling the test for the next set of subjects for the girls. Markus pulled out a book Al had brought with him about \"Multidimensional Spellcasting\". It was a relatively recent publication that talked about spells that consisted of multiple layers of individual spell circles that worked in conjunction.\n\nThe pleasant sound of two quills scratching against paper emanated from the open-air classroom. Through the variations in the sounds, Guy could decipher two distinct natures. One sound was mechanical and rhythmic. There were frequent, yet minute pauses between them, but the sound would resume with a square cadence without a misstep.\n\nThe other sound was flowing, yet measured. There was no frivolity, however, there was a distinct lack of uniformity. Yet even with its fluid nature, there was conciseness in it. This sound also had more frequent and increasingly longer pauses compared to the first one. Guy could feel a growing sense of uncertainty and frustration as time progressed.\n\nGuy lifted his gaze and followed the source of the second sound, which was Jean. Even through her unflinching facade, Guy could feel rising anxiety and distress radiating out from her. Her free hand was becoming increasingly fidgety, with her fingers clawing away at the skin adjacent to her thumb.\n\n\"Is there a problem, Jean?\" Guy asked, causing Jean's head to jerk up in shock.\n\n\"Huh? I... ummm,\" Jean muttered under her breath while averting her gaze.\n\n\"It's alright, you can tell me,\" Guy said in a calm voice with a warm smile.\n\nJean bit her lips and spoke up, \"I'm stuck... I can't seem to answer any more questions.\"\n\nHer shoulders dropped in defeat, her eyes boring down on the workbook which was barely a quarter of the way in.\n\nGuy nodded and assuaged her by saying, \"That's okay! I didn't expect you to answer all of them.\n\nHe then called out to Markus, \"Markus! Can you help Jean out? I want you to teach her everything properly and bring her up to speed. She should be thorough with the contents covered in that workbook. If you need any more resources or practice questions, then let me know, alright?\"\n\nMarkus' head jolted up from his book. He absorbed his Master's complete instructions and nodded affirmatively. He moved up next to Jean's seat and dragged it closer to her.\n\nWith the boy barely an arm's length away, Jean suddenly grew flustered. It was her first time being near a person of another gender who was of her age.\n\nBefore her mind could dwell on that thought any further, Markus' voice pierced through, \"So where did you get stuck?\"\n\nJean shook her wandering thoughts and quickly shuffled through the pages. Although she had made it thus far, Jean suspected that some of her earlier attempts weren't completely correct. And her guess was proven true when her Senior Brother clicked his tongue, \"Tsk, you've used a roundabout method here. Because of this additional step, you've opened yourself up to unnecessary errors such like over here.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to correct Jean's mistake and rushed through the partially correct question, stopping at her last attempt.\n\n\"So you don't understand this question?\" Markus asked.\n\n\"This question deals with a topic in maths known as Algebra. It is basically a method you can use to solve problems where you don't know the value of all variables present,\" Markus rattled on.\n\n\"A variable is a symbolic representation of the unknown. It doesn't hold any numerical significance. The main goal with Algebra is to isolate this variable on one side of the equation so that we can determine its value.\"\n\nIn the beginning, Jean nodded along as Markus explained the nuances of Algebra. However, after a point, her nods became infrequent until they stopped completely.\n\n\"So let's try an example: 3x+2 = 5, solve for x,\" Markus instructed as he quickly jotted down the equation on a free page.\n\nJean stared at the question for while, her hand growing increasingly fidgety.\n\n\"Ummm,\" she murmured while biting her lips.\n\n\"Tsk, you need to isolate the x! How do you do that?\" Markus shot out with a trace of irritation.\n\n\"Let the girl think, will ya?\" Marie's voice responded with an equal amount of irritation laced within it.\n\nMarkus ignored Marie's outburst and kept his focus on Jean.\n\nAfter another minute of inactivity, Markus interjected with a more stern tone, \"You subtract 2 from both sides...\"\n\n\"Right...\" Jean chimed in as she hurriedly jotted it down on the page.\n\nAfter half a minute of inactivity, Markus growled, \"What next?\"\n\n\"Stop it with the badgering! You can't expect her to answer the question right away. If I remember correctly, it took you at least a week to properly understand these types of questions,\" Marie retorted.\n\n\"Marie!\" Markus bellowed.\n\n\"Did you just call me by my name?!\" Marie barked.\n\nThe two descended into a heated argument, with poor Jean stuck in the middle.\n\n\"ENOUGH!\" Guy hollered while slamming his hand on the desk. \"You two! Out with me! NOW!\" He followed up with a firm tone.\n\nMarkus and Marie shrank back into their bodies at Guy's sudden shift in temperament. They fearfully stood up and followed Guy out of the confines of the area, and went behind the orphanage wall.\n\nGuy drilled his stern gaze at the two culprits and started, \"What are you guys doing? Huh?\"\n\n\"Master, she keeps interrupting me when I'm trying to teach Junior Sister Jean,\" Markus replied.\n\n\"Teach? Is that what you call teaching? You're just screaming at the poor girl!\" Marie responded.\n\nBefore the two could break out into an argument once again, Guy interrupted them, \"Enough!\"\n\nAfter a long sigh, Guy explained, \"Markus. Do you know why I asked you to teach Jean? It's not because I'm lazy, or because I'm unwilling to teach her. I want you to think back to your interaction with her, but take a step back and thoroughly criticise your approach. Do you think you think you were teaching her effectively?\"\n\n\"But Master, I explained the concept to her properly-\"\n\n\"Did she understand it when you explained it?\"\n\n\"She did, right?\"\n\n\"How do you know? Did you test her understanding? Did you confirm that her comprehension was proper and thorough?\"\n\nMarkus hesitated, and shook his head, \"I did not.\"\n\n\"My purpose in letting you take the lead here was to cultivate an important value in you. Patience,\" Guy added.\n\n\"We've covered a lot of ground in the span of a single year. At the pace we are going, we can cover even more distance. However, it isn't sustainable! If we continue like this, we will be building upon a shaky foundation, and it will open us up to disastrous consequences in the future. Therefore, we must first shore up our concepts thoroughly before moving ahead. The best way to do that is by conveying the knowledge we've gained to another party. By breaking down your insights and moulding them for the other party to understand, we can further enhance our comprehension of the topic.\"\n\nMarkus vocalised a hum in affirmation as an epiphany struck him.\n\n\"I want you to go back, and start again. Your goal is to make Jean understand everything. She should have such a strong grasp on the topic that she should be able to teach it to another person with equal efficacy!\" Guy commanded amidst Markus' vehement nods.\n\n\"And you, why do you keep interrupting Markus when he is doing the task I assigned him?\" Guy resumed as he turned his gaze to Marie who had a smug smile on her face.\n\nHer grin quickly dissipated as she fielded the interrogating question, \"I was agreeing with your assessment. Markus wasn't teaching properly-\"\n\n\"That's not the task I gave you, was it?\"\n\n\"But-\"\n\n\"Marie! By interrupting Markus and undermining him constantly, you are effectively lowering his authority in front of Jean. Would she feel compelled to listen to Markus if you're building up such a poor image of him in her eyes?\"\n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"I understand that you have a sense of responsibility for everyone here, but while you're in my classroom, I need you to act like a student. That means to respect everyone and treat everyone equally. Rather than diverting your attention and preoccupying yourself with other people's business, I need you to focus on your work. Can you do that for me?\" Guy added.\n\nMarie nodded affirmatively and quickly replied, \"I'm sorry. I won't do that again.\"\n\n\"Good. Now you two, let's go back and continue with our work.\"\n\n\"I've already completed all the questions,\" Marie commented as they returned to the class.\n\n\"All of them? So quickly? Do you want to recheck them?\" Guy asked to clarify.\n\nMarie shook her hand and said, \"No need.\"\n\nGuy affirmed with a hum and collected her completed workbook. After glancing at a few intermittently spaced questions, Guy nodded with an impressed expression. All of them were attempted properly and answered correctly. Even the final question, which was supposed to be the toughest, was answered fully and without a single error.\n\n\"You're good!\" Guy commented.\n\n\"Thank you, I've had some practice,\" Marie answered humbly.\n\n\"I can see that! Would you like to continue? I have another set with a few topics that might be a bit new to you,\" Guy asked.\n\n\"Sure!\" Marie responded with visible excitement.\n\nWhile the two conversed, Markus returned to his seat next to Jean and spoke apologetically, \"I'm sorry about earlier. I realised that my approach was incorrect.\"\n\n\"N-No, that's okay...\" Jean blurted out subconsciously while waving her hands.\n\n\"Let's start again from the beginning, okay? I believe I skimmed through a few sections before. If we shore our concepts from there, you may find Algebra much easier to digest.\"\n\nMarkus turned to the page he had skimmed through earlier and contemplated on his next approach.\n\n\"Negative numbers are... Right! Think of numbers as the state of your stomach! When you eat too much, you feel bloated. When you eat too little, you feel starved. The feeling of bloat is analogous to positive numbers. The feeling of starvation is analogous to negative numbers. When you're feeling starved, as you keep eating food, you feel more and more full, until you feel neutral. That's like starting on the negative number on the numeric scale and adding positive numbers to it, till you reach zero,\" Markus said with a trace of unsurety near the end.\n\n\"Does that make sense?\"\n\nJean snorted good-naturedly at Markus' humorous explanation and answered, \"It makes sense.\"\n\nMarkus smiled with elation as he exclaimed, \"Great!\" and instinctively raised his hand towards Jean for a high-five.\n\nJean stared blankly at Markus' open hands.\n\n\"Tap it!\" Markus instructed.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nMarkus sighed and grabbed onto Jean's hand, causing the girl to flush beet-red almost immediately. He then proceeded to clap her hand against his own.\n\n\"Like that! It's a high-five! You do it to celebrate an accomplishment,\" He explained.\n\n\"Y-Yes, Senior Brother,\" Jean muttered.\n\n\"Woah! Your face is all red! You're heating up-\"\n\n\"I'm going to drink some water!\" Jean exclaimed as she immediately rushed out of the classroom while covering her face.\n\n\"What did you do to her now, you brat?\" Marie said jokingly after observing their interaction in its entirety.\n\n\"I-I didn't do anything! She just went to get some water!\"\n\n\"Whatever,\" Marie snorted with amusement. \"Anyways, don't grab women's hands like that so brazenly the next time, you dense little boy,\" Marie retorted offhandedly.\n\n\"Huh? Did I do something wrong?\" Markus muttered while scratching his head in confusion.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-097]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":122,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 095 - Meaningful Purpose","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nBeing put on the spot like that, Jean was rendered speechless.\n\nWhy was she so eager to learn magic?\n\n'Do I even want to learn magic?' She asked herself.\n\n#Right! Just give up already!#\n\n*But what about our dreams?*\n\n'What dreams?'\n\nEver since that \"fateful\" day, all Jean ever dreamt of was her mother's savage demise.\n\nJean's composure shattered as the weight of the question and its implications dawned upon her.\n\nLearning magic and walking the path of magehood was a foregone conclusion to the heirs of renowned clans. It was just something they had to do because it was the only way the clans could hold onto their positions. Although society appeared refined and tranquil, it was truly a vicious battlefield filled with underhanded tactics and subterfuge. The only thing keeping the Empire from falling apart was the unspoken cold war waged between the various powers that be.\n\nEach clan under the Solar Empire had a particular interest to maintain, and in order to do that, they needed to enforce their dominion. The only logical way to do so was through a show of force. Most long-standing clans in the Empire had a mage powerhouse behind them. These ancient powerhouses often referred to as clan ancestors, would be beings at the peak of power. For the clans at the highest seat, these ancestors could be in the Tesseract Transformation realm. Their presence along acted as a deterrent against opposing clans seeking to make unwanted advances. However, the presence of the clan ancestors wouldn't stop clans from waging minor wars. After all, there is little reason for a nigh godlike being to play their hands in a conflict between ants.\n\nAnd it is in those conflicts that having clan members with great magic potential comes into use. Why was Gaige shunned by his clan members before he unveiled his Abyssal Wyrm physique? It was because he was a wasted seed in the clan's eyes, or in simpler terms he was \"trash\". Should the Bori clan enter a conflict between another clan or organisation, the boy could only act as cannon fodder to distract opposing firepower. However, once the boy showed his full potential, his position in the clan was naturally elevated.\n\nUltimately, Jean also happened to fall under the category of \"trash\" according to her clan's standards. So obviously, her goal in learning magic should be to overcome this label and prove her clan members wrong, right?\n\nOnce Jean arrived at that conclusion, she looked into Teacher Lark's eyes. She internally repeated the reason multiple times. As she did so, she realised that maybe that wasn't the answer Teacher Larks was looking for. Furthermore, it didn't exactly seem like a reason she was comfortable with either.\n\nThe whole premise seemed like a slippery slope to her. How much was enough to prove her clan members wrong? Was it enough to simply show an aptitude for magic? Was it enough to defeat every possible candidate for the clan leader position in combat? Was it enough to defeat every clan opposing her own? Was it enough to elevate her clan to the ranks of monarchy? When. Was. It. Enough?\n\nOnce the cycle of rationalisation began, there would never be an end. Her clan would keep wanting more, and she would be a slave to those ambitions. Would she be content with that?\n\nAt least with her Senior Brother, there was a visible end to his goal. Strength enough to protect loved ones was honourable and achievable. Sure, the finishing line may be subject to movement, however, Senior Brother Markus would be in full control of that.\n\n'Maybe that's it! Rather than looking outwards, I must search within,' Jean surmised.\n\nSure, her drive to become a mage started with the aim to satisfy her father. However even before all of that, Jean had the goal in mind albeit for another, more personal reason.\n\n\"I want to walk the path of magehood to become the best healer in the world!\" Jean blurted out.\n\n\"Please elaborate,\" Guy said while nodding.\n\n\"I want to become stronger and more capable to be able to cure any disease, ailment or injury in existence.\"\n\n\"And why is that?\" Guy responded.\n\n\"Because...\" Jean hesitated.\n\nThe words were at the tip of her tongue, but she just couldn't voice them out.\n\n#Don't you dare say it! You don't deserve it! Mother-killer!#\n\n*But it is her drive!*\n\nThe voices ran rampant in Jean's mind, one hindering her from voicing her thoughts, the other attempting to assuage her with sweet words.\n\nJean gritted her teeth and force out her words, \"I. Want. To. Follow. In. My. Mother's. Footsteps!\"\n\nShe started to breathe heavily once the words left her mouth.\n\n\"M-My mother was the best healer I knew. She was both strong, and caring. No matter who came to her with a problem, she would step up to the plate and work double-time to make sure that they were cured. There were times when she failed, but she never gave up and kept driving forward. I want to be as good as- No! At least half as good as her!\"\n\nJean's voice was filled with resolution and a plethora of emotions. It even surprised her just how effusive she was.\n\n\"That's a noble cause you are working towards,\" Guy commented. \"I heard about what happened to your mother, Jean. It was a tragedy. I am truly sorry, from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nGuy left it at that. He knew that there wasn't anything he could say that could alleviate the girl's burden. So he felt it best to move on from the topic, and let the girl heal naturally. He had seen many children like her in his past life, some in even worse positions, and had successfully rehabilitated them from the abyss. Healing the heart was a gradual and measured process, one couldn't rush it.\n\n\"Now Jean! I need you to keep this goal in mind as you learn magic. Never forget why you started, and more importantly never twist the words of your own goals, because that is the first step towards losing yourself,\" Guy instructed.\n\nJean nodded solemnly and affirmed, \"I understand, Teacher Larks!\"\n\n\"Good! And now,\" Guy continued as he turned to face Marie. \"What is your purpose in learning magic, Marie?\"\n\n\"I want to protect my loved ones,\" Marie answered offhandedly.\n\n\"Don't try to deceive yourself, Marie,\" Guy said with a firm tone. \"Why. Do. You. Want. To. Learn. Magic?\" Guy enunciated as he approached Marie.\n\nMarie looked into Guy's eyes and lost her words. Did she want to learn magic? Of course! Who wouldn't? But Marie was practical. She knew that the family could only afford to support one person through a Magic Academy. She was too old, and the twins were too young. She knew Markus was at the perfect age, and so she readily made the sacrifice. She could have been selfish and went in Markus' stead, but the odds weren't in her favour. So, after foisting the responsibility onto Markus, Marie readily cleansed any thoughts of pursuing magehood from her mind. What was the point in dwelling over a forgone conclusion?\n\nAnd yet, a chance had fallen into her lap. A Teacher of Magic was willing to offer free lessons at the comfort of her own home. How amazing was that? She jumped on the first opportunity to sit in the class, however, reality pulled her out of her fantasy just as quickly.\n\n\"Why do I want to learn magic?\" Marie repeated and received a hum from Guy.\n\nIt was a valid question. Marie understood that Teacher Larks wasn't being facetious here and stalling for time because his process was robust. Without an achievable goal, what was the point in setting out to do anything? People's actions require reason, after all, otherwise, they have simply wasted energy.\n\nBut the truth was, at that moment Marie had no idea why she wanted to learn magic. An immature thought that popped into her mind was that 'everyone is learning it, why can't I?'\n\nHowever, that wasn't reason enough to fuel the process. Both Markus and Jean had an acceptable reason. Yet no matter how much Marie racked her brains, she just couldn't formulate a worthwhile goal for herself.\n\nWith a dejected frown, Marie answered, \"I can't think of a goal, Teacher Larks.\"\n\nGuy shrugged and said, \"That's okay! But without a goal, I won't teach you magic.\"\n\nMarie grew increasingly dispirited when Guy finished the declaration. However, before she could get up and leave at her own volition, Guy added, \"That doesn't mean that I won't teach you anything at all. Magic is a tool to apply your knowledge. I have intentionally limited the use of this tool. However, I haven't placed any restrictions on the knowledge needed to work it!\"\n\n\"Markus must have already told you that my classes specifically for magic are divided into two. One in the morning and one in the afternoon. The class in the afternoon deals with the theories behind the manipulation of mana and similar concepts that form the core in using the tool that is magic. However, the classes in the morning deal with a separate set of subjects that supplement the application of magic by providing perspective. You don't need to be a mage to learn these subjects as they deal with fundamental truths of this world. If you are willing, I want you to sit in during these classes and participate. Maybe, you might get some inspiration and formulate a goal for yourself through it?\"\n\nMarie lowered her gaze and thought about it. Logically, she had nothing to lose. She had a lot of free time now since she no longer had any obligations. And she somewhat agreed with Teacher Larks' reasoning.\n\nSo after a quick minute, Marie answered, \"Okay! I would like to do that!\"\n\n\"Awesome! Let's not waste any more time, then!\"\n\nGuy reached into the deep pockets of his jacket and, after fumbling around for a few seconds, he pulled out two identical books.\n\n\"For today's class, since we have two new members, I want to start from the very basics to gauge exactly where you guys stand. Based on your performances, I plan to tweak my lesson plans,\" Guy expounded while handing a book each to the two girls.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-096]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":123,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 094 - Setting Goals","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nMarkus arrived at the classroom much earlier than the scheduled morning lesson. He would spend the additional time before the start of the lesson to clean up the classroom and prep it for his Master. Although Guy had told him that it wasn't necessary, Markus felt that it was his responsibility to make his Master's life easier in any way possible, given how Guy was teaching him for no fee. Besides, Markus had heard through secondary sources that it was often a Disciples task to perform such trivial tasks to support their Masters.\n\nWhile Markus was going through his self-assigned task, a new face entered the classroom. Well, calling it a room would be inaccurate as it was open-air. Anyways, the new face happened to be his newest Junior Sister, Jean Rasmus.\n\n\"Good morning Senior Brother,\" Jean greeted with a respectful quarter bow. Markus smiled and nodded in response before returning to his task of cleaning the chalkboards.\n\nJean assumed a seat close to the chalkboard and started to fidget with her fingers nervously. It was her very first session with Teacher Larks, and Jean was feeling extremely anxious. To top it off, the voices in her head were having a romp of a day as well.\n\n#You'll fail!#\n\n*No you won't!*\n\nThe argument in her head went along those lines.\n\nA short minute after her arrival, another person entered the classroom, much to Markus' surprise.\n\n\"Big Sis!\" He exclaimed.\n\n\"Good morning,\" Marie responded coolly. She then turned to Jean and unleashed a bright smile as she bellowed, \"Little Sis!\"\n\nMarie beelined towards Jean and assumed a seat next to her.\n\n\"When I woke up, I saw that you weren't there. Did you not sleep well?\" Marie asked with visible concern.\n\nJean shook her head and replied, \"I have trouble falling asleep. I woke up early so I decided to take a walk to clear my mind.\"\n\nAs the two girls conversed, Markus interjected with a light cough, \"Sis, what are you doing here?\"\n\nMarie frowned retorted, \"Why? Am I not allowed to be here? In my own home?\"\n\nMarkus smiled bitterly and responded, \"You know what I am talking about, Sis. What are you doing HERE?\"\n\n\"I'm interested in learning from Teacher Larks as well. He's a Teacher of Magic after all. Since he's offering to teach for free, I might as well jump on the opportunity, right?\"\n\n\"That isn't fair to Master, Big Sis. I'm already being shameless in learning under him for free, how can you, in good conscience, impose on him like this?\"\n\nSeeing how Markus was getting increasingly worked up, Marie backed down and waved her hands, \"Relax! Okay? I'm just curious about how he is teaching you. Think of it as the inquisitiveness of a concerned guardian, alright? You should understand my point of view. Hearing how a Teacher of Magic is offering their services of free, I want to make sure that he isn't getting you into anything shady.\"\n\nMarkus shook his head vehemently and retorted, \"That is extremely disrespectful towards Master! How can you even assume that after everything I've told you, Sis?\"\n\n\"Then are you asking me to leave?\" Marie asked with a stern tone.\n\nBefore Markus could respond, another voice pierced through the argument, \"What's this about telling someone to leave?\"\n\nGuy walked in while massaging the back of his neck, \"Markus, after today's class I need you to hand Mister Rasmus a few silver coins. I've asked him to purchase a better pillow for me. He refuses to take my money so I need you to push it into his hands and run away, okay?\"\n\n\"Now, why are you asking your sister to leave?\" Guy asked Markus pointedly. \"If she wants to learn, let her do so. It's not our place to dissuade someone who is actively pursuing enlightenment.\"\n\n\"I understand, Master,\" Markus immediately responded with a respectful bow and assumed his seat.\n\nGuy walked over to the front of the classroom and gazed at all the student's that were present. He observed their expressions to determine an optimal starting point. Jean wore a usual flat expression that obscured any outward emotions, however, Guy noticed her picking at the skin of her fingertips frantically. This was a clear indicator of anxiety and distress. Marie on the other hand was completely relaxed. Guy could immediately glean that this girl wasn't here to learn. She had the same aura of a troublesome class-clown aiming to derail the lesson in order to attract attention.\n\nGuy's mind whirred into motion as an optimal plan of action materialised through familiarity. This wasn't his first rodeo, and it would definitely not be his last!\n\n\"I understand that you guys are here to learn Magic and Cultivation. However, before we get to it, I feel that it is important to first establish a few things in advance. When I first met Markus, I asked him why he wanted to become a mage? Whenever we initiate something, we need to have a worthwhile goal in mind, or else we will never be able to follow through and gain something out of it,\" Guy started.\n\n\"To my question, Markus said that he wanted to become a mage to protect his family. He said that the world was inherently dangerous and that he needed the power to be able to protect himself and his loved ones. It was an admirable goal, and I respected it. Now, I think Markus can confidently say that he is strong enough to protect his family, given that he doesn't actively go out of his way to seek trouble from a party stronger than him of course. So Markus, since you have achieved your initial goal, why are you still walking the path of magehood?\"\n\nMarkus was taken aback by the spontaneous question. He furrowed his brows and contemplated on it for a while. After a short minute, he answered, \"I want to continue walking the path of magehood to protect my family.\"\n\nGuy tilted his head and retorted, \"But like I've said, you are strong enough now. As long as you don't court death, your current strength should be enough, right?\"\n\n\"My goal always has, and always will be to protect my family. However, my current family is no longer just my siblings and Matron Reva. I consider you to be a part of my family too, Master,\" Markus clarified.\n\n\"You may disparage yourself constantly, and claim that you are simply ordinary. However, you seem to overlook just how brightly you shine, Master. Even though you've secluded yourself in this village, a renowned Teacher and the leader of a powerful Clan both personally came to ask you for a favour. I believe there is a saying that it is the tallest trees that catch the most wind. No matter how hard you try to act subdued, trouble will one day find its way to you, Master. It is a fact of this world. And when that day comes, I hope to be someone strong enough to weather the storm in your stead!\"\n\nGuy bit his lips in distress and added, \"I'm grateful that you think of me that way, Markus. But it is my job as your Master to protect you-\"\n\nMarkus shook his head and interrupted Guy immediately, \"I'm sorry Master, but I disagree! And please don't dissuade me! You've asked me for my goal in continuing in the path of magehood, and I answered truthfully. Please don't force me to change my goal...\"\n\nWith a wry smile, Guy acquiesced, \"Fine. But I want you to keep this goal in mind! 'Protect'! That is the keyword. Magic is a privilege, not a right. I don't want to see you using your gift for malicious purposes, because not only would you be going against my teachings, you would be opposing yourself!\"\n\n\"I understand, Master!\"\n\nGuy hummed in affirmation and reached into his coat pocket. He pulled out the Magic Wand he had confiscated from Markus and returned it to the boy.\n\n\"I'm giving this back to you trusting that you will stay true to your goals. Please don't disappoint me again,\" Guy instructed as Markus grasped the weapon with both his hands.\n\n\"I promise to only use this wand for protecting myself and others, never to exploit or suppress,\" Markus professed solemnly.\n\nGuy returned to the front of the classroom and resumed.\n\n\"Having a worthwhile goal is key when it comes to anything in life. It is even more important when we're talking about magic. With all the benefits and advantages magic brings, it is also a curse because of the unfathomable power it carries.\"\n\nGuy leaned forward and spoke with a morose tone, \"Power is an extremely corrosive agent. For some born with luck, this power comes easily. For others less fortunate such as Markus over here, it is an arduous path filled with bitterness. In both cases, the accumulation of power without proper accountability and assumption of responsibility can lead to the rapid breakdown of the psyche. One can easily drown themselves in the power and lose sight of their morals and ethical values. That is why we establish goals. As long as your goal is robust, you will never lose yourself.\"\n\n\"Hence, you should know that my initiative to teach you magic is also dependent on the type of goal you set for yourself. I will not indulge any students learning magic for malicious purposes such as revenge, no matter how righteously you frame it!\"\n\nGuy then turned towards Jean, and asked, \"So Jean, what is your goal in pursuing the path of magehood?\"\n\n\"M-My goal?\"\n\n\"Why do you want to learn magic?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-095]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":124,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 093 - Pleasant Memories","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nJean woke up earlier than usual. Although the new environment was quite tranquil and soothing, it was always uncomfortable to be pulled out of one's comfort zone. It was twice as hard for Jean since even back in her own bed she would struggle with sleep, given her frequent nightmares.\n\nIn the end, rather than laying on the mattress and staring blankly at the ceiling, Jean figured it would be better to take a walk and familiarise herself with her new home. That is, as long as Teacher Larks would have her.\n\nJean quickly shook away those disparaging thoughts that threatened to infiltrate her psyche, which would ultimately be propagated by the deprecating voices in her head, and calmly walked out of the orphanage. Yesterday, courtesy of Senior Brother Markus, she was already accustomed to the general layout of the orphanage. He had also pointed out areas to avoid and areas to be wary of, although there weren't that many to begin with.\n\nWithout a goal in mind, Jean decided to take a stroll in an arbitrary direction to see where her feet took her. And with that, Jean began walking.\n\nIt had been quite some time since Jean had last left the confines of her clan's mansion and lived out in the wilds. After her mother's passing, her initial, childlike wonderment with nature and outdoor living had somewhat subsided. However, now that she had returned to the said environment, she found it pleasantly welcoming.\n\nAlthough the mansion was cleaner and more ordered, it didn't offer the same level of solitude and peace of mind as the open woods. Even with the constant chatter from the birds, the mirthful bubbling of the nearby spring, and the infrequent grunts, squeals, screeches and squeaks of the plethora of fauna, Jean found the ambience to be more calming and stimulating to the mind.\n\nShe didn't know for how long she walked, but soon, Jean found herself in front of a small, fenced-off space adjacent to the spring. The fencing was sufficiently low for her to look over, yet it was sturdy enough to dissuade the various small rodents and creatures nearby from entering.\n\nAs Jean observed the area beyond the fences, she noticed a bunch of familiar shrubberies, herbs, plants and flowers situated near and around the spring.\n\nHer eyes gleaned with interest as she mentally listed them off through familiarity.\n\n____\n\n\"This is a Gracidea plant. Do you remember what its uses are?\" Nyla asked while carefully sprinkling droplets of water over the leaves of the pink coloured plant in front of her.\n\n\"Gracidea leaves are used as prophylactics against low-level illusionary spells. An incense created by powdering dried Gracidea roots can also act as a sobering agent,\" A little Jean answered with a serious expression on her face.\n\n\"You forgot one use,\" Nyla pointed out, to which Jean narrowed her eyes and pouted.\n\n\"I- I forgot...\" Jean confessed while dropping her shoulders with a frown.\n\nNyla chuckled and plucked a small flower shooting off from the Gracidea plant and nimbly attached it to Jean's hair, \"The Gracidea flower is also used as a gift to a loved one. It symbolises gratitude and affection.\"\n\n\"Mommy...\" The little girl said while sulking. Although she tried her hardest to appear angry, her chubby and cute appearance, augmented by the frivolous flower adorned on her head, simply made her look even more endearing.\n\nNyla reached forward and pinched the girl's puffed cheeks, \"What is a healer's primary goal?\"\n\n\"To do everything within their power to treat their patients to the best of their judgement,\" Jean answered while raising her head, as though she were trying her best to recollect the exact phrase.\n\n\"Exactly! But always remember this! Treating a patient may not always correspond to external injuries,\" Nyla added. She then kneeled in front of Jean and tapped her head, and then at her chest above her heart, \"Some injuries hide deep, beyond our sights. Even the strongest of mages can never find them. To become a true healer, we need to pursue treatment in a holistic sense.\"\n\nJean didn't seem to understand what her mother said. However, she noticed her mother turning her attention towards the herbs in the garden. Therefore, to not disturb her mother, Jean walked close to her and observed her actions.\n\n____\n\n\"They're in good health. You don't need to inspect them like that, it might damage the stem's integrity,\" A calm feminine voice brought Jean out of her stupor.\n\nSubconsciously, Jean had entered the fenced premises and was performing physical inspection through the various herbs in the field with a pre-programmed sense of familiarity. It was a practice Jean used to adhere to back in her garden at the mansion in the city.\n\n\"I'm sorry. It is a force of habit,\" Jean replied while facing the somewhat unfamiliar woman.\n\n\"It's fine. I figured that you were experienced by the way you approached the plants,\" The woman replied while closing the fence door behind her.\n\nJean deduced that she was probably the person Marie referred to as Matron Grace Reva. She was a short woman; although she was as old as Teacher Larks, she was only just taller than Jean. In fact, apart from the woman's sharp chestnut-brown eyes, there weren't any special features that made her stand out from the crowd. Grace was just perfectly average, to an almost uncanny degree.\n\nJean looked around the garden and spoke with an impressed tone, \"These plants are well maintained, especially given the uncontrolled environment.\"\n\n\"I have some experience,\" Grace responded. As she did so, her face adorned a bitter expression. Jean noticed this and deduced that there were probably a few unpleasant memories associated with that statement. This was because it was the exact expression Jean wore, or at least wanted to wear, when someone asked her about her mother's passing. It wasn't a memory Jean wanted to dwell on.\n\n'It must also be Matron Reva's sore spot.'\n\n\"It's the only thing I am good at anyway,\" Grace confessed. \"It pays the bills. Keeps everyone fed.\"\n\nJean nodded solemnly. \"You don't enjoy it?\"\n\nGrace shrugged and got down to work. She scanned around and found a herb ripe for the picking, and expertly handled the stem and leaves. While she was doing this, Jean just stood there and stared at Grace with a blank expression.\n\nThe girl didn't move from her place for a long time. This cause Grace to grow a little discomfited. Breaking the awkward silence, Grace spoke up, \"If you aren't busy, why don't you help me out? You can start near the spring. Harvest those that are ready.\"\n\nGrace had seen the way Jean handled the plants, and she knew right away that Jean was experienced. Therefore, Grace didn't fret when it came to delegating the task to Jean. If the girl were anyone else, such as Marie, Markus or the Twins, Grace wouldn't have done it so readily and confidently.\n\n____\n\n\"Do you know what this flower is called?\" Nyla asked while pointing at a blood-red blooming flower floating in position at a flowing spring passing through the garden.\n\nJean shook her head and said, \"No.\"\n\n\"It's the Enduring Lotus. It is one of the most useful plants ever recorded. First, this lotus only grows in flowing water, never stationary. It's because its life cycle is extremely quick, and so it requires a steady influx of minerals and sustenance to support this growth rate. In stationary water bodies, it just isn't feasible. Interestingly, even in flowing water, this lotus plant never moves from the place where it is planted. That's because the moment the seeds touch water, they quickly sprout and anchor themselves firmly at the bed.\"\n\nNyla brought Jean closer to the spring's bank and pointed at the petals of the lotus.\n\n\"We can use the petals of the Enduring Lotus to create potions that invigorate blood. It is extremely useful for women with heavier flows during their monthly periods.\"\n\nNyla directed Jean towards the large leaf pad floating underneath the lotus and continued, \"The pad of the lotus can be squeezed to extract its oil, which can then be used to coat items with a temporary waterproof layer. The seeds within the lotus can also be squeezed for their oils and can be used for cooking. Furthermore, the seeds can also be eaten as a light snack.\"\n\nNyla pulled the lotus towards her and exposed the long anchoring stem and root extending from the bottom.\n\n\"Due to the strength of the lotus stem and root, we can use it to make ropes in a pinch. Peasants also use it to make temporary and cheap clothing or apparel.\"\n\n\"But interestingly, the Enduring Lotus is named such not because of its ability to withstand the pressure of flowing rivers. It is actually because of this right here,\" Nyla added while pointing at a series of inconspicuous thorny protrusions along the length of the stem.\n\n\"Due to its myriad of uses, the Lotus should theoretically be a delicacy relished by the river fauna. However, these thorns here act as the greatest deterrent, earning the Lotus its name.\"\n\nWith a curious expression, Jean reached towards the stem. Nyla was too distracted in explaining the various characteristics of the lotus, that she failed to catch Jean's approach. By the time she noticed, Jean had already touched one of the thorns on the stem with her index finger.\n\n\"Jean no!\" Nyla screamed.\n\nIn pain, Jean pulled her hand away and in the process, her flesh ripped against the minuscule barbs lined at the tip of the thorn causing the earlier prick to elongate into a bloody gash.\n\nJean winced as the effects of the unceremonious slash assaulted her. Before she could voice a response, her hand was caught within the warm grasps of her mother and was quickly dunked into the flowing river water. Nyla pulled it out immediately and shoved the affected finger straight into her mouth, slobbering it with her saliva.\n\n\"Ewww!\" Jean commented while scrunching her nose, seemingly forgetting all about the pain on her fingertip.\n\nNyla smiled slyly and explained, \"Saliva has the ability to heal, did you know that?\"\n\n\"No way! You're joking,\" Jean rejected.\n\n\"Am not! Don't animals always lick their wounds? It's because they are naturally cleaning it and letting it heal,\" Nyla explained. She chuckled and then said with feigned seriousness, \"You better get used to this, Jean. In the future, when you become a healer, you will have to lick your patients' wounds too!\"\n\nJean squirmed in place in disgust and laughed along with her mother.\n\n____\n\nJean was brought out of her stupor this time by the assault of a warm, wet and fleshy feeling at the tip of her right index finger.\n\n\"Tsk, I kept calling out to you to be careful. How can you get distracted like that when handling an Enduring Lotus? You cut yourself real good, didn't you?!\" Grace reprimanded as she doused Jean's bloody finger with her saliva inside her mouth.\n\n\"Ah!\" Jean exclaimed in surprise, causing Grace to realise what she had just done.\n\n\"I'm sorry! It's a force of habit... The twins keep cutting themselves all the time, especially Dora. I did that subconsciously,\" Grace said with a wry smile.\n\nGrace's expression quickly turned into a frown, and she added with a soothing tone, \"It must've hurt you real bad, huh? It's okay, don't cry.\"\n\n\"I'm not cry-\" Jean stopped herself when she noticed a saline liquid dripping along the side of her cheeks and off her chin. She felt the trail leading up her cheek, towards her eyes, and her jaw dropped agape in surprise.\n\nGrace brought Jean's finger towards her and wrapped it with a small length of cloth torn from her dress. After dressing the wound carefully, Grace said with a smile, \"There! All fixed up. It's okay, the pain's only temporary. Mark my words, once this wound heals, your finger will be even stronger!\"\n\nGrace chuckled, to which Jean reciprocated, but with an awkward attempt.\n\nGrace rubbed Jean's head and said, \"I'll handle the rest, you should go and treat the wound properly. If any dirt gets in, it might hurt more.\"\n\nJean complied and left the fenced area. As she walked away, her fingers once again touched her cheeks and felt the long-forgotten sensation of tears streaming down them.\n\nAfter a very long time, Jean's cold and uncaring face cracked with a nostalgic smile. Alas, no one was there to witness it.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-094]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":125,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 092 - Interesting Tales","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGoran's emotions fluctuated from one end to another as a series of thoughts and conclusions ran rampant through his head.\n\n\"Hahahahaha!\" He laughed fanatically as he waved an arm, pulling a chair from the classroom behind him towards himself.\n\n\"I want you to explain to me your rationale,\" Goran declared inquisitively as he sat down.\n\n\"Father...\" Jean pleaded. \"This is... inappropriate,\" she reasoned.\n\n\"Nonsense! The boy said that he has never seen a Red Dragon before, I believe him. He said that he read about it in a book, and then drew it out based on the descriptions, I believe him. But I want to know how he was able to capture the aura of the Red Dragon so intricately, and that too with such accuracy?\" Goran replied.\n\nHe turned to Kano, and said, \"If you wouldn't mind, I would like to read this excerpt. Unless of course you aren't allowed to share it.\"\n\nKano shrugged, ran over to a shelf and pulled out a massive book, almost as thick as his arm. He placed the heavy book on a table and familiarly scrolled through the pages, stopping around two-third of the way through.\n\n\"Here,\" Kano said while pointing at a passage on the book.\n\nGoran walked over and started to peruse through the text. Being at the Core Condensation realm, speed-reading was a trivial task for him. He flipped through the pages while simultaneously absorbing everything inscribed on them. With each passing second, another page was turned, and the expression on Goran's face morphed capriciously.\n\nUnknowingly, Goran had flipped towards the end of the book. Without pause, he returned to the start and began reading, working his way furiously towards the point where he had initially started.\n\n\"This book, is it a travelogue? A journal of some sort?\" Goran asked Kano.\n\n'J.R.R. Tolkein? I haven't heard of this mage before. He must be an ancient one too! The text is extremely detailed, albeit a little vague in some areas. Some of the magic described is extremely old and cryptic, but it is definitely cross-referenceable. Maybe... is he the one behind Guy's inheritance?'\n\n\"No. Teacher Larks said it was a work of f-f-fiction,\" Kano explained.\n\n\"That can't be true. The details are so vivid and lifelike. It has to be a journal from well before the Age of Isolation. Some of the races described in here are now extinct on this Realm, after all,\" Goran continued.\n\nKano shook his head and repeated, \"Teacher Larks specifically said that it was a work of fiction. None of it is true.\"\n\n\"That may be the case my boy, but fiction often has its roots in reality. For instance, Trolls used to be a widespread menace in swamps and murky regions back in the day, although now they are more of an endangered species. Goblins and Dwarfs are from the Fel realm, so are Dragons! The skin-changers and Elves are endemic to the Fae realm. Finally that ring! It's obviously a Legendary grade enchanted artefact, probably of Dwarven origin I presume!\" Goran further reasoned.\n\n\"Wow! You know so much!\" Kano exclaimed with starry eyes. The childlike fascination and praise unwittingly boosted Goran's ego. The man smiled warmly and rubbed the little boy's head. The girl, Dora, approached Goran as well and asked with an excited tone, \"Uncle, have you seen the Great Eagles before?\"\n\nGoran tilted his head and thought for a while. \"I haven't seen any avian beasts exactly like the ones called Great Eagles described in the book. However, the closest one I can recollect is the Thunderbirds of the Wrathful-Peak Mountain at the South of the Serrated-Peaks range. They're massive yet extremely rare creatures. Some believe them to be myths, but only those as strong as Teacher Jeeves and I can ever hope to see them. And that is because these birds are extremely elusive and unbelievably fast. I've seen only one in my entire life. It was a juvenile Thunderbird, but it was already at the Core Formation realm. Unlike us humans, the Thunderbirds are gifted with superior bloodlines and are born with a high aptitude for magic. To balance out their strength, though, these creatures rarely give birth.\"\n\n\"Interestingly, these birds mate for life. Quite literally at that too! If a Thunderbird's mate dies, they go through a process of lamentation that invokes a storm of unimaginable proportions, at the end of which they sacrifice their vitality and follow their partners...\" As he finished the last sentence, Goran's voice trailed off with a longing tone.\n\nKano was first to notice Goran's shift in emotions. The boy cautiously grasped onto the saddened man's hands and smiled warmly. Kano's disarming smile melted through Goran's heart and lifted his dampened spirits.\n\n\"Anyways... as I was saying. The Thunderbirds are just one such avian species. There are also the Phoenixes of the Melted Islands! They are even rarer to find and are considered one of the strongest beasts attuned to the fire element. In fact, Phoenixes never actually truly die, they simply undergo a process of rebirth through which their soul is recycled. Many consider them to be the true immortals of this world...\"\n\nGoran resumed his eager storytelling as the two kids sat down next to him.\n\nJean observed her father's contented smile for the first time in many years. She too tried to smile with her father, however, she could feel her face opposing her. Slumping her shoulders, she turned to Markus and said, \"Why don't we continue?\"\n\nMarkus nodded and carried on with the tour.\n\n\"Well, there isn't much to see around the orphanage. Mister Rasmus said that he would manage your accommodations here in the future, however, for the time being, you will have to bunk with my sister. I hope that is okay? If you have any questions, ask away!\"\n\nJean thought for a while, and said, \"Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Does Teacher Larks expect anything from me before the beginning? Any tests I need to prepare myself for?\"\n\n\"Woah! Woah! Relax. Can you read?\" Markus quickly interrupted Jean.\n\nJean pursed her lips and nodded.\n\n\"That's good. That's all you need to know. You should trust Master Larks. You should trust his process. I was much, much worse than you in the beginning. At least you had access to resources, and Teachers actually bothered to turn your way and put some effort into trying to teach you. I didn't even have that. But look at me now! It was all thanks to Master Larks' efforts and skills.\"\n\nWith a nostalgic smile, Markus continued, \"When we first met, I was a completely lost cause. I was ready to give up! But then I met Master Larks. In our very first encounter, he promised me that he would find a way for me to advance in my cultivation.\"\n\nMarkus chuckled, \"It is needless to say, but Master definitely went above and beyond what he promised. For that, I will always be grateful. So, don't worry. You just need to apply yourself and put just as much effort and Master does in your training. Got it!\"\n\nJean nodded vigorously, with a firm expression, and replied, \"This one understands, Senior Brother!\"\n\nMarkus' neck reddened in embarrassment. He quickly muttered in a low voice, \"M-Master said not to call me that...\"\n\nAs he finished, he noticed Jean's shoulders twitching in mirth. His expression darkened visibly, and he spoke with a stern tone, \"You're pranking me.\"\n\nBut he was quickly met with a firm slap to the back of his head, \"Stop scaring my Little Sis, you stinky boy!\"\n\n\"Big Sis...\" Markus replied while massaging his head.\n\n\"Big Sis,\" Jean said while lowering her head.\n\n\"Oh, my cute Little Sis! Tell me immediately if this brat is being pretentious or overbearing! I'll teach him a lesson,\" Marie declared.\n\n\"Big Sis, please...\" Markus pleaded. \"Leave me some dignity in front of my Junior,\" he added with a bitter smile.\n\n\"Pssht! Respect through seniority is all bullshit! Listen here, Jean! If you want respect, you need to earn it. People tend to take it for granted when they are given respect for no apparent reason,\" Marie reprimanded while glancing at Markus from the corner of her gaze.\n\n\"Anyways what are you guys doing here?\" She asked.\n\n\"Jean here will be staying with us while under Master's tutelage. Until her father manages her accommodations, she will need to sleep over, so I was hoping-\"\n\n\"Shameless boy! How can a teenage, unmarried, girl sleep in the same room as an adolescent, sexually charged, boy like you?\" Marie interrupted. \"Thank goodness I caught you, otherwise I fear that you will have taken advantage of my poor, innocent Little Sis.\"\n\nJean's and Markus' faces both reddened at the same time as embarrassment swept over.\n\n\"M-Marie!\" Markus hurriedly stuttered. \"I was bringing her-\"\n\n\"Don't listen to him, Little Sis! You can bunk with me tonight,\" Marie interjected once again. She stuck out her tongue at Markus, grabbed Jean's hand and pulled her away.\n\nWith Jean gone, the only people left in the tour were a red-faced and sheepish Markus, and a completely stoic and unfazed Josie.\n\nThe two gazed at each other as an awkward silence began to stew over.\n\n\"So...\" Markus said to break through the discomfort.\n\n\"I saw your match against Gaige Bori,\" Josie spoke up. \"You fought well. It wasn't an easy matchup.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Markus replied with a wry smile. The fight was still sort of a sore spot for him.\n\n\"You don't understand. I was sincere when I praised your mettle. I've personally experienced a |Wave of Darkness|, the spell Gaige cast near the end. And that too from a mature Abyssal Wyrm at the prime of her life. I know what it feels like. You fought well.\"\n\nMarkus' eyes widened in surprise.\n\nSuddenly, Josie's tone turned incisive, \"I can rest assured that Young Miss has a strong and capable Senior brother such as yourself. And if what you said is true, that your Master played a large role in your success, I am glad to know that my Young Miss will be treated well.\"\n\nThe statements, though genuine, had a tinge of threat embedded into them that struck Markus. He realised that Josie wasn't speaking her mind, rather she was making a declaration. She was telling him to make sure that Jean wasn't harmed, wronged, or hurt in any way.\n\nJust as Markus was about to speak his piece in response, Josie disappeared, leaving no trace of her presence.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-093]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":126,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 091 - Abstraction","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nGoran's exclamation drew the attention of the twins. Once they noticed the three new faces, the two cautiously retreated behind Markus and peeked out from behind his legs.\n\n\"Little Boy. Did you paint this?\" Goran asked with some excitement as well as mild amusement.\n\nKano looked up at Markus, who returned a smile and said, \"That is Jean Rasmus. She is Master's newest student. This Sir is her father, Goran Rasmus.\"\n\nKano nodded in affirmation and spoke with a low hum, \"It's Smaug...\"\n\nGoran started approaching the painting and inspected it more closely.\n\n\"It's weird... It doesn't capture the exact facade of a Red Dragon, however, everything about it tells me that it is. The colour tones, the shapes, the aura...\" The man commented, to which Kano frowned.\n\n\"It isn't a Red Dragon! It's Smaug?!\" Kano retorted as he slowly left Markus.\n\n\"What species is the dragon?\" Goran replied without diverting his attention from the painting.\n\n\"I... I don't know...\" The boy answered.\n\n\"Does the dragon have an elemental affiliation?\" Goran asked through practice. However, he realised that he was talking to a little kid and rephrased his question, \"Does the dragon bellow fire?\"\n\nTo that, Kano nodded vehemently with bright eyes.\n\n\"Then the dragon you call Smaug is a Red Dragon. In actuality, though, although the species are called Red Dragon their scales are a lighter shade of brown. They're given that moniker because the moment they bellow fire, their scales light up with a bright scarlet hue,\" Goran explained.\n\nHe then continued with praise, \"I believe it is a Red Dragon that you've painted here, if not for the colour and sort of surreal physique I could swear that it was the real-\" however he interrupted himself midway.\n\nThis was because as he moved his hands over the mural, a gradual change started to take place. It started from the end of the painting and worked its way inwards.\n\nThe almost vibrant looking colours, with an overcoat of sheen probably due to wetness, started to slowly diminish and gained a more natural-looking shade. This, however, did not detract from the \"feeling\" emanating from the painting. In fact, the now sober tinting offered a more authentic grace to the design. And just as Goran had indicated earlier, the vibrantly drawn red-coloured dragon was now assuming the actual shade of light brown.\n\nAwestruck, Goran took a few steps back and observed the painting once again in its entirety. A mysterious transformation was taking place in front of him, the like of which he hadn't witnessed before. Through familiarity, Goran activated his mana sense and encapsulated the mural.\n\n\"It's charged with mana?\" Goran exclaimed.\n\nIt wasn't substantial, however one could observe a very faint and even coating of mana overlaid on the painting. It was so faint that anyone could miss it if they weren't actively examining the painting.\n\nMoreover, this coat of mana was not rapidly dissipating from the painting. Through Goran's mana sense, it looked as though the wall was emanating steam. And as the steamy wisps of mana escaped from the wall, Goran noticed that they carried out the inherent energy within the paint, causing it to set. As the paint dried, some of it seeped into the pores of the wall, which was why the vibrance of the painting diminished gradually.\n\n'Such calculation?' It was a truly inspired outcome. There were a lot of details that needed to be measured and calculated before the paint hit the canvas, which was the wall in this case. If there was a mistake in any of these details, the result would have been completely inferior to what it was now.\n\nYet this little boy had taken into consideration all of them, and that too to such a precise degree.\n\nWhat was even more unbelievable was the manipulation of mana to maintain the fluid state of the paint. Goran looked at the boy's paint-covered hands and noticed the presence of a nearly depleted mana crystal.\n\n'To have such precise control over mana...'\n\nIt was nothing short of genius. Only a true virtuoso in mana control could achieve such a uniform film of mana coating over the paint, especially when drawing the mana from a crystal.\n\nUnfortunately for Goran, this wasn't the last surprise Kano had to offer. Because the man had overlooked the painting altogether while he was engrossed in internally praising Kano.\n\nAs the final wisp of mana left the painting, a deep yet barely scrutable change occurred within the painting, that everyone else but Goran missed. Almost symbolically, the last wisp of mana escaped from the pupils of the dragon, and as it hopped off the wall, as though a being of unimaginable power had woken up from a slumber, a wave of death tinged with fiery and unending greed swept over Goran.\n\nGoran's eyes locked on the pupils of the dragon. Within the almost abstract representation of the dragon, its eyes were the only components that held a contrasting sense of hyper-realism. Even though he tried to maintain an unfaltering gaze, he couldn't overcome the predatory gaze of the drake. He could feel himself cowering under the towering, ruthless regality of the monster as a sea of gleaming gold started to wash over him, drowning him, suffocating him. The monster's casual gaze drilled into him, musing at him, at his weakness. It was toying with him!\n\nAnd then... \"It blinked!\" Goran screamed, attracting everyone's attention.\n\n\"I-It blinked! Josie, did you see that?\" Goran asked, to which Josie simply lowered her head and apologised.\n\n\"Jean?\" Jean too shook her head and frowned.\n\n\"But... it blinked...\" Goran muttered.\n\nGoran retrained his senses at the painting, only to see that it had turned dormant. The voracious and fear-inducing aura no longer permeated from the painting. Instead, there was now an extremely faint feeling of inert threat. It was as though the beast within had entered a deep slumber, disturbing which would herald a death by unquenchable fire and fury.\n\n'It's still persisting?' Goran commented.\n\nAlthough he didn't look it, Goran was a devoted connoisseur of art no matter its form. Be it dance, music, food, literature, or even visual artworks. In fact, he had even enrolled in and graduated with great achievements from a plethora of appraisal courses in an attempt to widen his palette and broaden his appreciation of arts.\n\nWith regards to the visual arts, in particular, Goran knew that there were levels to a painting that classified its quality against others. For instance, a noteworthy painting, at the lowest level, would portray its content in a remarkably lifelike form. In fact, two-dimensional realism was just the first step. The second level would take this to the next level, by allowing manual infusion of mana from the viewer to cause the content of the image to attain a three-dimensional and lifelike form. The third level would maintain the above criteria, and would also have the added effect of evoking an emotion or thought from the viewer.\n\nThe fourth level could pull the viewer (not literally) into the painting by connecting to them spiritually. The fifth, and final level of painting would allow the painting to sustain spiritual life, almost like a microcosm in and of itself. However, these two also required the embedding of mana gems, as mana was required to sustain this capability.\n\nThe first three levels of painting were achievable by mages of Core Formation realm and below. A mortal was already capable of achieving the first level. the fourth and fifth were usually only attainable by Core Condensation realm mages due to the spiritual elements involved in the painting.\n\nHowever, what both stumped and impressed Goran, was that the painting before him was able to easily qualify for the fifth level. Although it wasn't of the quality of the renowned works floating around in this world, this particular painting was definitely standing on the cusp of assuming the qualification.\n\nWhat was interesting about this painting, though, was that there was no sign of any intricate brushwork or even any pre-planning with regards to composition in general.\n\nThere was a sense of measured haphazardness in the painting, that was evoked by the frantic strokes. Upon closer inspection, Goran realised that the whole painting was done using the little boy's fingers. The scales had distinct, yet also uniform thumb strokes that lined the sides of the dragon, forming impenetrable chainmail. These light brown-red accented scales descended towards the underbelly where they were replaced by yellowish-golden and disordered, jagged finger jabs. There was a subtle indication of the change in the material lining the dragon, where its overcoat was obviously its natural scales, while the underbelly was probably the accumulation of random gold, silver, and jewellery. Right at where the heart of the dragon was supposed to be located, was a bare patch free of any scale or golden encrustments, highlighting the dragon's glaring weakness. However, although this was visible, Goran didn't feel the least bit assured or safe.\n\nThis was because the drake was at a constant state of relaxed alertness, highlighted by the vigilant eyes, drawn using a combination of finger strokes and linings drawn using the nails.\n\nThe entire ensemble was painted without any sense of orthodox realism in mind, and it ran contrary to all established painting conventions where practitioners sought masterful techniques, precise brushwork, and verisimilitude. Yet, it achieved everything those so-called expert works tried to do, through a path that most would have considered barbaric, uneducated, and uncouth.\n\nIt was an enlightening trip for Goran. He had learned that even if a painting was abstracted, it was possible to achieve similar results. And it was all possible thanks to the boy's mastery over colours and shapes.\n\n\"I have learned much from your work, Kano,\" Goran said with a respectful tone, causing the boy's cheeks to redden in embarrassment.\n\n\"I must ask, how did you get the idea of infusing mana into the paint?\"\n\nKano scratched the back of his head and answered sheepishly, \"I don't know. It just made sense to me.\"\n\n\"Is it possible to elaborate?\"\n\n\"Hmm... Smaug couldn't accept half-measures. He had to be finished at once. Teacher Larks told me that if liquid gained energy from the environment, it would evaporate. I saw that the thin coat of paint was gaining energy too quickly on the wall. I had to tell the paint to hold onto the energy, so I used the m-m-mana stone to do it.\"\n\n\"Wow! How did you manage to keep the mana so thin and consistent? And that too until you finished the painting?\" Goran asked with increased elatedness.\n\nKano tilted his head and answered blankly, \"The paint had to dry altogether. I told the mana to hold the energy for me...\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"I... I d-d-don't know,\" Kano replied with a dejected pout. \"It just made sense to me...\"\n\nGoran's jaws dropped in defeat. He smiled bitterly and said, \"I guess it is true when they say that asking a genius to explain themselves is like asking a bird how to fly?\"\n\n\"I-I-I am not a genius!\" Kano exclaimed in distress.\n\n\"Boy, stop being modest! I guess it is because you haven't left his village and seen the world, but the work you have produced just now blows every other renowned piece from grandmaster painters out of the water. Sure, there is still a lot of improvement and growth on your end, but the way it stands right now, I can see that you will achieve great things in this field.\"\n\nAnd Goran wasn't lying when he said that. As stated before, the work was at the cusp of the fifth level. Sure it wasn't evident yet, but he could tell that maybe a few more years of practice and the boy would be shoulder-to-shoulder with the other experts. However, what was even more important to note was that it was able to achieve this without the need for a mana gem!\n\nIt was an unprecedented achievement, to say the least. No mage had achieved this in this realm in the last 6000 years, since the last artisans and craftsmen able to encapsulate such phenomenon in their works without relying on ramshackle solutions such as mana gems had also disappeared from this realm around that time.\n\n\"By the way. Seeing as you drew this dragon, I must ask. How were you able to capture it so well? Have you ever seen a dragon before?\"\n\nKano answered matter-of-factly, \"Not really. I read it in a book.\"\n\nGoran nodded with a blank smile, \"Read it in a book?\"\n\n\"Yes. I read it in a book.\"\n\n\"Read it in a BOOK?\"\n\nKano nodded.\n\n\"READ it in a BOOK?\"\n\nKano shrunk his head into his shoulders in seeing Goran's increasingly agitated expression.\n\n\"READ IT IN A BOOK?!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-092]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":127,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 090 - Sensory Overload","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy and Al split up from the group and left the orphanage. Guy walked listlessly as his mind was preoccupied with cobbling up a decent way to break the news to Grace. He knew for a fact that she wouldn't be particularly keen on having another individual, especially a mage, living in her orphanage. Through observing and getting to know her through infrequent, yet charged, conversations Guy found out that the woman wasn't that fond of mages. At first, he thought it was just him she was averse to, but he noticed that sometimes when Markus practised magic, Grace would consciously avoid him. Guy didn't know why this was the case, but he could discern that it must have something to do with her past.\n\nHe wasn't planning to dig into it just yet, though. He had all the time in the world to get to know Grace all over again. That is, as long as he didn't actively court death. Which was quite ironic given Guy's current predicament.\n\nWhile Guy was sweating bullets and running through multiple variations of his prospective conversation with Grace, Al seamlessly reached into his coat pocket and retrieved his storage disk and declared, \"I'll be taking that area over there!\"\n\n\"But there isn't a room there...\" Guy said anxiously. The region Al was pointing towards happened to be a barren section of land, a minute away from the orphanage.\n\n\"East facing... Decent clearing... This will do perfectly!\"\n\nBefore Guy could ask any further, Al siphoned his mana into the disk, causing it to activate. A long and continuous flow of canvas and rope gushed out of the disk, followed by a series of wooden beams of varying sizes, as well as multiple metal fasteners, nails and the like.\n\nMagically, before Guy's very eyes, the items whirled around and started to join together, gradually assembling themselves into a simple yet functional bell tent.\n\n\"Amazing!\" Guy blurted out in awe.\n\nAl smile smugly and declared, \"It's a handy little thing, this one!\"\n\nAfter a short minute, the assembly was completed as the nails submerged rigidly into the hard ground, tightening the ropes and raising the canvas.\n\n\"Adequate!\" Al said with a long exhale.\n\n\"You're going to live there? In that?\" Guy asked in disbelief.\n\n\"Tsk... Sometimes, a bland exterior often hides vast secrets,\" Al said ominously as he led Guy into the tent.\n\nAs Guy approached the set-up, he decided to extend his mana sense into it. It was a surreal feeling for him, to be able to sense things beyond measly human sensory limits. It was as though he was hearing, smelling, seeing, feeling and tasting things all at the same time, without actually physically interacting with the object. Another thing to note is that after a mage advances to Foundation Establishment, the mana sense can also double as an eternally active |Inspect| cantrip. \n\nAs explained before, the mana sense is like an extension of the user's senses. Whatever a human can observe through their major five sensory organs, the mana sense can do the same. However, mana sense is special in that there isn't a limit to what it can capture. For instance, bats can hear sounds at frequencies beyond human limits. A human mage can also tap into this higher frequency using the mana sense. To do that, however, they will need to first know what they are looking for in order to tweak their mana sense and become more perceptive to this higher frequency noise.\n\nFurthermore, the mana sense can also tap into a phenomenon normally inaccessible to humans given their sensory organs. Sharks, for instance, can sense electric fields through their snouts to detect prey in murky or dark waters. A human being does not have such a sensory organ, and thus are unable to process this information. If a human mage uses their mana sense to access these signals, they will receive data in a form incomprehensible to them. The human is then required to make sense of this data on their own since they do not have an existing organ to filter it and process it. Therefore, while handy, the all-seeing mana sense can sometimes act as a double-edged sword in cases where the mage lacks sufficient experience in understanding the abstract data captured through their mana sense, in which case one can often end up with false or misleading conclusions.\n\nGuy was in a special position because his knowledge from his previous life had given him a better grasp on a wide range of topics, thus granting him the ability to process a decent range of information parsed through his mana sense. He had actually relied on this advantage when building his modular spellmaking technique. However, no amount of knowledge from his previous life prepared him for what he sensed within the tent.\n\n\"ARGH!\" Guy grunted while clutching his head.\n\nAl hissed in reprimand and said forcefully, \"How can you be so reckless to extend your mana sense into unfamiliar territory like that?\"\n\nGuy massaged his forehead and said, \"Isn't that why we have mana sense?\"\n\nAl shook his head and replied, \"Would you dunk your head into a random hole in the ground to see what's inside?\"\n\nRight as he finished that question though, Al bit his tongue as he grasped the irony of the situation. He had done the same thing just a few minutes ago inside Markus' core!\n\n\"*cough* Although the mana sense offers a mage some foresight, it can also act as a mage's greatest weakness. 'A blind child does not fear the crackle of lightning, while a deaf child fears not the bellow of thunder. A child with both senses intact, however, fears the heavens for their anger cannot go unseen or unheard.' Your senses can be used against you if you aren't careful of how you use them.\"\n\nThoughtfully nodding his head, Guy followed Al into the tent.\n\nUpon entering, Guy realised why he was suddenly assaulted by an unbearable pain when probing into the seemingly quaint looking dome. It was because the simple tent hid a massive secret. And that secret was that the tent was actually massive! The interior spanned an area at least 10 times the true size of the tent. Furthermore, there were separators within the tent isolating the space into different rooms. The area Guy and Al were currently standing in was the living room, and it had a layout similar to a Middle-Eastern majlis from Earth, with a clear skew towards floor seating. \n\n\"No wonder...\" Guy muttered as a realisation struck him.\n\n\"This tent is lined with space-warping enchantment gems,\" Al commented while pointing at multiple large, dark gems lined along the circumference of the tent's roof. \"Paid a pretty price for it too, but it is definitely worth the purchase!\"\n\n\"How much did it cost?\" Guy asked casually.\n\n\"500,000 gold coins,\" Al answered nonchalantly.\n\n\"500,000?!\"\n\n\"You underestimate just how hard it is to enchant a non-forged item. While forging weapons or armours or trinkets, you can mould the mana veins to augment the enchantment you want to embed. However, with items like this canvas, you don't have the luxury of doing that. The only way to line mana veins into this material is by personally sewing them in using the finest Dreadbrood Arachne silk while constantly outputting a steady flow of mana through the threads. It needs to be done in the dark too because the moment the silk threads are exposed to light of any kind, they dissolve into highly concentrated mana that immediately dissipates into thin air. You need a mana sense and coordination so precise... Anyways, the 500,000 gold going expenditure is definitely worth it!\"\n\nThe tent's interior was decorated in a fashion similar to Al's office in the Academy's library. Although, the space seemed much cleaner, and had hints of ageing. Apparently, the tent had been out of use for a very long time.\n\n\"Come! Sit here! We have a lot of ground to cover, and much to talk about!\" Al enthusiastically declared while calling Guy over to the cushioned floor level sofa at the living area.\n\nGuy acquiesced and the two descended into a jovial conversation just like back in the Academy.\n\n____\n\nWhile Al and Guy conversed in the tent, Markus acted as a dutiful host and took up the task of guiding Jean and company around the orphanage.\n\n\"It isn't much, this place. These steps lead down to the village. I'd recommend that you get to know everyone there. Doesn't hurt to make a few more acquaintances after all,\" Markus commented.\n\nHe took the group around the back of the orphanage and along the way, he explained, \"This is where Master holds his classes. Our class is early in the morning, and late afternoon. In between, Master tutors the kids from the village.\"\n\n\"Teacher Larks is teaching the villagers magic?\" Goran asked.\n\n\"No, just the regular subjects. Literature, mathematics and so on,\" Markus elaborated.\n\n\"Why is Teacher Larks involving himself with mortal subjects?\" Goran reciprocated in confusion.\n\nMarkus tilted his head and asked, \"Is there any particular reason why he shouldn't?\"\n\n\"Well... Not really. It's just that I've never heard of a Teacher of magic who also teaches mortal subjects...\"\n\n\"Master believes that everything is connected in one way or another. No knowledge is superior or inferior,\" Markus narrated solemnly.\n\nGoran nodded after some contemplation. As they approached their destination, Goran heard a lively conversation.\n\n\"Kano, this doesn't seem right. Look, it says, 'My teeth are swords. My claws, spears. My scales are like tenfold shields. My wings are a hurricane. And my breath, DEATH'\" A little girl's voice said in confusion.\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Well... The teeth of the dragon you drew don't look like swords. The claws don't look like spears either. And the scales don't seem to have any resemblance to shields... And how do you even draw death? I thought you were painting Smaug?\"\n\n\"*sigh* They are metaphors, Dora.\"\n\n\"What's a metaphor?\"\n\n\"It's a stylistic literary d-d-device. Authors use it to create emphasis,\" Kano explained.\n\nGoran extended his senses around the corner and saw the little girl, called Dora, pouting.\n\n\"You should have heard of the phrase, 'A smile to light up the room'?\" The boy continued. \"Well, can a smile actually light up a room?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head and answered, \"No. Doesn't it just mean that the person was smiling wholeheartedly?\"\n\n\"It's the same here. Take a few steps back and look!\" As the boy declared boldly and took a few steps back, Goran and his group turned the corner and lay their eyes on the wall.\n\n\"Wow!\" The little girl exclaimed in awe. Her thoughts were mimicked by Jean and Josie, who beheld the sight in its entirety.\n\n\"That!\" Goran blurted out. \"That's a Red Dragon!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-091]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":128,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 089 - Jean Rasmus","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy coughed and smiled wryly after hearing Goran's question.\n\n'How am I going to answer that?'\n\nHe could say yes and agree with whatever Al just said before. But was it the right thing to do?\n\n'Al is literally stretching my BS story to its limits by deriving such a conclusion...' Guy thought to himself.\n\nBut then something struck him.\n\n'Wait a minute! This whole interaction... The misunderstanding... A character showing his ignorance after performing a feat that most would consider extraordinary or downright impossible...'\n\nGuy's eyes widened in shock.\n\n'No. Way! Did I just lie so convincingly that I actually materialised my own system-slash-cheat-slash-goldenfinger?'\n\nIn some ways, there was truth to that statement. If Guy hadn't dug his own grave by forming a nonsense story about Homo Sapiens and the like, he wouldn't have aroused Al's unbending curiosity. And if he hadn't aroused Al's curiosity, he wouldn't have had to dig further and formulate a lie to cover up the earlier lie, for which he even had to resort to reading cult literature. If he hadn't read those abominable texts, his RoK wouldn't have formed an offshoot and spawned the ominous Church.\n\n'Who knew that the whole concept of \"Manifesting\" those two-bit motivational speakers exhorted about would actually work?!'\n\nThis new segment to his soul, as Mast called it, was a thorough mystery since neither Guy nor Mast had an inkling of its functionality or raison d'être. According to Mast, it was a side effect that resulted from Guy's fervent absorption of insights that ran counter to his core. Usually, such actions would have resulted in a cultivation deviation, but the RoK had intervened in some ways. After all, the RoK wasn't originally a part of Guy's soul either.\n\nHowever, even with all the weird things The Church brought him, Guy was kind of grateful for its existence. After using it on multiple occasions, and learning of its various uses gradually, Guy had come to view it with more respect.\n\n(You are being quite rash about all of this. 'The Church', as you put it, is unfamiliar and completely unexplored territory, for both of us. I want you to let that sink in. Even I, a being much, much more ancient than this world you are in, have absolutely no idea about what that thing is. I shouldn't even be letting you live with it inside you. It's like a time bomb, waiting to explode, taking us both down in the process.)\n\n'Why are you being so cautious all of a sudden. Weren't you the one to make the risky play by bringing me into this world?' Guy retaliated.\n\n(It may come across as such to you, but everything was within the boundaries of my plan. But this! This is out of my control. Not within the realms of my plan.)\n\n'It hasn't done anything precarious yet-'\n\n(Yet! It is only a matter of time.)\n\n'Then why don't you just take it out of me?'\n\n(It is a part of your soul now. I can't tamper with it without damaging your soul in the process. Are you willing to go through with the procedure?)\n\n'Umm... Are there any adverse effects?'\n\n(Best case, you lose a chunk of your identity and warp in some way. Worst case, total annihilation,) Mast answered monotonously.\n\n'Let's not do that then.' Guy received a second life and a second opportunity to pursue Grace. He was satisfied.\n\n'Guess I'll limit my use of The Church then?'\n\nInterestingly, while before this internal conversation would have taken just as long in reality as it had in Guy's mind, after advancing to Foundation Establishment, Guy benefitted with some perks. One of the more prominent of which was a marginal increase in mental faculties. Guy could think a bit faster, and process information flowing through his mind more quickly. One must note that not all mages enjoyed such boosts equally. Their cultivation tended to skew these perks accordingly. For instance, a swordsman cultivator's mind would process combat sequences more quickly as opposed to formulating internal debate simulations. Thankfully, Guy's cultivation happened to boost his mind in the latter.\n\nSo barely a few seconds had passed since Goran asked the question by the time Guy terminated his internal dialogue. After centring himself, Guy spoke with an uncertain tone, \"I guess so.\"\n\n\"That's amazing! Truly fortuitous,\" Goran replied, nodding in approval.\n\n\"It would have been an even more fortuitous opportunity to get to know exactly who the Ascended mage was, though,\" Al added.\n\n\"Agreed. Although I haven't personally witnessed the wonderful things encapsulated within the inheritance. I believe it must have been a veritable treasure seeing just how much Al over here has been gushing about you the entire time we were travelling to this village,\" Goran said with a smile.\n\nAl coughed and nudged Goran with his elbows causing everyone present to laugh mirthfully.\n\n\"Anyways, while I understand that there's a lot of things left for us to talk about, there's time for that. You see, Guy, we actually came here with a purpose. Goran?\" Al started.\n\nGoran nodded and gestured towards Jean, who stood up and walked towards Guy.\n\n\"Teacher Larks. As a father, I only have one wish and that is to see my precious girl live a happy, fulfilling, healthy, and long life. It may not sound like much, but it means the world to me. And it is for that reason that I implore, no beg of you to take her in as a personal student, and raise her just as you have done with Markus,\" Goran sat on his knees and lowered his head respectfully.\n\nJean followed her father and prostrated herself, albeit in a much lower stance to emphasise her show of respect.\n\nGuy jumped to his feet and rushed to lift Goran, \"Please, Mister Rasmus. Don't do this! You're putting me in a tough position by acting like this.\"\n\n\"This is what I must do, Teacher Larks. You should know by now that I am in the Core Condensation realm. I will surely live for a very, very long time. It may sound selfish, but I don't want to outlive my daughter. No parent should have to bury their child. I've already had to bury my wife, I'm afraid my heart cannot handle the loss of my precious little girl.\" As Goran finished, his voice wavered as a wave of emotions gushed out.\n\n\"Father...\" Jean uttered as she grasped Goran by his sleeve in distress.\n\nGoran raised his other sleeve and dabbed his wet eyes. \"You're the only one who can help my daughter, Teacher Larks. I am willing to give up anything for it!\"\n\nGuy was thoroughly shaken by the gargantuan man's open display of emotion. Not many men would be so comfortable with themselves to express themselves so outwardly. Furthermore, the man was willing to put everything of his on the line for his daughter. Such a selfless expression of love and emotion increased Goran's standing in Guy's eyes by many levels.\n\nGuy smiled bitterly before probing with a question, \"You must have already consulted a vast number of teachers prior to this, right?\"\n\nTo which Goran nodded while pursing his lips. Guy exhaled loudly and continued.\n\n\"Pardon my frankness, but what gives you the confidence that I can achieve something that even those greater and more renowned than I have failed to do?\"\n\nGoran laughed out loud, his tone washed with self-deprecation. \"I want to say that it's a gut feeling of mine. But that would be an insult to you. You are a skilled teacher. I can see it- I can feel it! Truthfully though, I am left with no other option. You are my final hope, Teacher Larks,\" Goran replied. He then patted Jean's shoulder and urged her forward.\n\nJean bowed once again and said, \"Please. This one implores Teacher Larks to accept her as his student.\"\n\n\"You don't have to do this, Jean,\" Guy interjected immediately. \"I don't require any elaborate, or over-the-top displays of subservience and sincerity. All that matters to me is your willingness to partake and learn from me. In fact, in this venture, we will be equals. I will learn from you just as you will learn from me. I don't need you to believe everything I say - I'd prefer it if you were critical - I don't need you to agree with everything I say - I encourage healthy debate and discussion. However, I need you to be honest. With me, and with yourself. I need you to be open. With me and with your peers. And finally, I need you to be compassionate. With me, yourself, and everyone else around you.\"\n\nGuy wore a warm smile and spoke to Jean directly, \"Jean Rasmus, are you prepared to accept these responsibilities?\"\n\nJean wore a firm expression and affirmed out loud, \"I am prepared, Teacher Larks!\"\n\nGuy reached over and patted Jean's shoulder. \"You are now my personal student. Seeing as Markus came before you he is, by default, your senior as per custom. Don't bother calling him that, though. He's the same age as you, and I don't want this brat to grow conceited.\"\n\nHe looked towards Goran and added, \"I can promise you that I will do everything within my power to help your daughter in her pursuit of magic. However, although I faced success with Markus, I cannot guarantee anything. I hope you can keep that in mind. This does not mean that I will give up after my first failure. I am not that kinda Guy.\"\n\nGuy chuckled at his own pun and continued, \"I will try again, and fail again, until I am successful, and believe me I will succeed!\"\n\nThe atmosphere in the room started to boil in excitement at Guy's affirmative declaration. It was partly a result of his hot-blooded resolution, and also partly because of the ambient mana fluctuations as a result of his subconscious emotional outbursts.\n\nThis was enough to convince Goran, and the man could feel a massive weight being lifted off his shoulders. One could visibly see that man growing mirthful and more excited by the minute as if he were regaining his youth once again.\n\nAl smiled at the turn of events, but quickly snapped his fingers, \"Right then! Since this is out of the way. We need to talk about our accommodations.\"\n\nGuy raised his eyebrows in confusion, \"Accommodations?\"\n\n\"Of course! Jean, Josie and I will be staying here while you teach Jean.\"\n\n\"I get that Jean and her attendant need to stay here, but why do you?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Al retorted shamelessly.\n\n\"That... isn't a valid answer...\" Guy muttered in disbelief.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-090]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":129,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 088 - Spirit and Will","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nAfter registering the question Guy went on to explain everything that had occurred, barely an hour ago, with enough detail to enlighten Al's doubts. Sure, there were parts Guy wasn't \"allowed\" to reveal such as the existence of The Church, since it would inevitably point towards the presence of the RoK inside him, which would, in turn, make it evident that he wasn't from this world.\n\n\"After Markus' loss against Gaige, he had been holing up in his room coming up with spells to counter the wave of darkness,\" Guy started.\n\nTo which Goran chuckled lightly.\n\nTo Goran's surprise, no one else chimed in with him.\n\n\"What?\" Goran asked in disbelief as he looked at Al. \"Wait, he's serious? Making new spells?\"\n\nAl simply nodded matter-of-factly.\n\n\"You're saying that as if he were assembling a toy! We're talking about spells here, right? Like spells, with intricate mechanisms, and theories, and functionalities?!\"\n\nAl nodded once again, and reprimanded Goran with a frown, \"Stop interrupting him, Goran.\"\n\nGoran raised his hands in defeat and retrained his attention on Guy.\n\n\"I then explained the science of the spell to him,\" Guy continued.\n\n\"Science? What's that?\" Goran interrupted once again.\n\n\"Goran! Please...\" Al said irritatedly, to which Goran once again raised his hands and mimicked zipping his mouth.\n\n\"Markus couldn't understand and fathom the details within the explanation. Which was expected, since he hadn't seen such a phenomenon before in his life. And so, to enlighten him, I sort of... transmitted a visual? Yeah... I think that best explains what happened there... I transmitted a visual of the phenomenon to him directly,\" Guy concluded.\n\n\"YOU DID WHAT?!\" This time, it wasn't Goran, but Al that exclaimed animatedly.\n\n\"I don't know how to put it into words. It was like this: I had the idea in my head, I just showed it to him,\" Guy said. As he explained, he grasped at the sides of his head, grabbed a handful of air, and flung it towards Markus' head. \"Something like that, I guess.\"\n\nAl started to breathe heavily, with his eyes bursting out at their sockets.\n\n\"No wonder the insights were so vivid and robust. You performed a |Soul Imprint|!\" Al muttered with excitement.\n\n\"|Soul Imprint|? But how?\" Goran parroted incredulously.\n\n\"That's the only explanation! You should have seen what I witnessed in the boy's cultivation. It was magnificent! The power... It was a hundred- No! A thousand- No! Argh! It was immeasurably stronger than the strongest darkness spell recorded in history! I can attest to that claim!\" Al declared.\n\nNoticing the growing agitation amongst the crowd, Guy cautiously voiced a query, \"Teacher Jeeves. What is this |Soul Imprint|? Is it a spell?\"\n\n\"What's |Soul Imprint|? Boy, are you daft?!\" Goran blurted out. \"You used the damn technique, how can you not know about it?\"\n\n\"Goran!\" Al reprimanded. \"Please pardon my friend, he often speaks his mind openly.\"\n\n\"Please, I'd actually prefer it if everyone talked that freely,\" Guy responded with a chuckle.\n\nGoran scratched his head sheepishly, \"You jest, but I will actually take you up on that offer!\" \n\nAl snorted in amusement and explained, \"|Soul Imprint| is an extremely rare and high-level technique. It is most sought after by Teachers and individuals at positions of power because it allows for quick transmission of large chunks of information as condensed packets. The best part about it is that not only is it possible to transmit information through |Soul Imprint|, but one can also transfer more abstract concepts such as emotions, hopes and so on.\"\n\n\"That sounds about right,\" Guy nodded. \"But why are you guys so agitated about all of this?\"\n\nGoran interjected passionately, \"It's because this technique is only possible when a mage reaches Core Condensation realm or above!\"\n\n\"That's inaccurate,\" Al corrected. \"It is possible to learn and apply this technique at the earlier realms, however, to be able to do so one must cultivate their spirituality to an extremely high level. This process in and of itself is time-consuming and arduous, thus most mages leave it till they hit Core Condensation and have time to spare towards improving their spirituality.\"\n\n\"Cultivating spirituality?\" Guy inquired.\n\n\"It is the final step a mage needs to go through before they can step off from their mortal coils and embrace true immortality,\" Al answered.\n\nAfter a pause he continued, \"Why do most people pursue magehood so ardently? For some, it is power. For others it is recognition. For most, it is to become immortal - longevity! But how does one truly achieve this so-called immortality? It is a fact that advancing in realms through cultivation grants the cultivator with longer life. But living for a long time does not make one an immortal.\"\n\nAl rested to let his thesis sink in, drawing in the audience. One thing he had learned after interacting with Guy was the perfect method to orate to an audience, regardless of demographic. As a renowned teacher, albeit one that had receded from the public eye for a long time, Al realised through self-evaluation that he had become quite detached from his base. In fact, he found that it wasn't just him, but even the more overt teachers, while successful, had horrendous skill in lecturing.\n\nBefore his acquaintance with Guy, Al thought that his peers such as Kaist were at the forefront of pedagogy. Many mages would line up for days just to gain the opportunity to listen to Kaist's scarce lectures. They hoped to extract as much insight as possible from the unbearably arcane concepts regurgitated during the lecture, in hopes of internalising them and achieving breakthroughs. But many didn't comprehend just how dangerous this was.\n\nTo internalise half-baked theories that sounded logical, without thoroughly vetting the information and cross-referencing its reliability and applicability with one's self was a surefire recipe for disaster. Even if this insight was derived from a lecture of a successful mage at a higher realm of cultivation, one mustn't forcefully augment their own cultivation with insights that were originally tailored to the lecturer.\n\nTherefore, Al realised that they had been going about it all wrong. A lecture wasn't just about disseminating information. A lecturer's main goal must be to maximise the assimilation of the information they're intending to circulate. Sure, lectures could entertain complex and advanced topics, however, the lecturer must recognise their audience and tailor their oration accordingly.\n\nAl admitted that there had been many occasions in the past when he lectured about advanced topics such as Familiar Inhabitation to freshly minted mages at Mana Condensation realm.\n\nFor most mages nowadays, these lectures had turned from a mode to teach into a platform to boast about their superiority.\n\n'Can't understand what I'm talking about? Well, you can only blame yourself that you aren't a genius such as I,' was the common thought paradigm.\n\nIt was a bitter realisation, but the fact remained. Was it better to lecture to a massive audience where 2% understood what you were talking about, or to a more mediocre audience where over 80% absorbed your words? Before, Al would readily agree with the former, but after meeting Guy, he was leaning towards the latter.\n\n\"It is the soul that tethers a magical being to their mortal coils. To transcend, one must untether, and to do so they need to merge their cultivation - that is the ultimate accumulation of their insights, a physical manifestation of their will - with their soul. This is a complicated process that not only requires an unshakeable cultivation, but also perfect control over one's soul. Many mages die during the transition from Core Condensation to Tesseract Transformation because either their cultivation has cracks, or their spiritual manifestation is unwieldy or non-compliant.\"\n\nGuy nodded and hummed in affirmation. \"That makes sense. Sure, it sounds a little abstract and fantastical - merging the soul and cultivation and what nought - but I can understand the conceptualisation.\"\n\n\"Coming back to the start of this discussion, |Soul Imprint|, as the name suggests, is a technique that can actually be picked up quite early in the path of spiritual cultivation. However, its efficacy is greatest at the mid to higher levels. Through it, a mage can transmit their own insights as a whole package to another, the size and quality of which depends on their spiritual cultivation. It is so difficult to become proficient in this that most mages without aptitude in spiritual cultivation avoid it altogether. Almost all teachers yearn to become adept in this skill.\"\n\nAt this point, Goran interjected, \"Based on what Al admitted earlier, it seems that you,\" he said while gesturing at Guy, \"have an even greater accomplishment in this technique than Al himself. And that too when you were at the Late stage of Mana Condensation realm? How is this even possible?!\"\n\nGoran's doubtful and piercing gaze bore down on both Guy and Al. The former started to secretly sweat bullets as pressure started to build up from within.\n\n'Here we go again. It seems I have to put back on that abomination and weave up some BS...' Guy wasn't looking forward to that. He had already spun a farfetched yarn a year back to throw Al off of his tail. And honestly, Guy had forgotten the exact plotline of his earlier lie. 'What did I tell him last time? Damn my other self! He cooked up some hot garbage and didn't note it down... What am I going to do?'\n\nGuy looked at Al with a blank gaze, which the latter took to be a signal of some sort. Because Al nodded in affirmation and began talking, \"Actually, Goran, Guy here has a secret he hasn't shared with anyone else except for myself and his Disciple here. What I am going to share with you must not leave this room without Guy's express permission. If it does I will not think twice before taking action!\"\n\nAl extended his warning towards the other parties in the room with a meaningful gaze.\n\nJean and Josie gulped audibly at being stared down by Al. Although Al joked often with her, Jean could feel the realness of the threat.\n\nGoran was the first to react and declared, \"I swear on my name and the name of my Clan. Should I break this oath, may I be struck where I stand and get reduced to ashes.\"\n\nThis was followed by Jean and Josie.\n\n\"I swear!\"\n\n\"I swear!\"\n\n____\n\nIn a small cottage in the village, Krish chuckled and voiced out audibly.\n\n\"I swear.\"\n\n____\n\nAl leaned in and spoke with a measured tone, \"Guy was fortunate to gain enlightenment from an inheritance of an Ascended mage. Although we don't know the exact specifics of it, since Guy himself is oblivious to how he stumbled across it, I am confident that whoever it was, they were highly unorthodox and extremely powerful. My hypothesis is supported by the fact that not only did this inheritance encapsulate a myriad of arcane, unheard of knowledge, but it also contained the skill |Soul Imprint|!\"\n\nGoran's jaw dropped in surprise, \"I-Is this true?!\" He asked Guy.\n\n\"Eh?\" Guy blurted.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-089]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":130,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 087 - Pulled to Safety","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nGuy had his attention trained onto Markus and Al. Although Guy had heard of methods to peer into a mage's cultivation, he had yet to see a method that didn't require the target to die first.\n\nThe books he had read before primarily detailed optimal strategies to siphon the cultivation from a dying mage's dissipating core. Efficient ways to decipher the numerous insights condensed within the roiling ethereal mass, and so on. So, when Guy observed Al's attempt to perform an inspection into Markus' cultivation, and that too in a safe way, he was immediately enraptured. He treated this as an opportunity to gain another technique for his toolbox. After all, since he was responsible for training his Disciple, a method to gauge the boy's progress on a regular basis would be extremely useful.\n\nTo learn more about the method, Guy employed a technique he was already familiar with, and that was to extend his mana sense. After breaking into Foundation Establishment, Guy's mana domain had expanded significantly. Before the breakthrough, it barely reached 10 metres, but now it covered up to 20 metres. By directing his now more sensitive mana sense towards the interaction between Markus and Al, Guy was surprised to find nothing particular of note taking place. For all intents and purposes, there was absolutely nothing going on. It seemed as though Al was simply placing his hand on Markus' belly.\n\n\"Do you feel anything different, Markus?\" Guy asked.\n\nMarkus furrowed his brows in contemplation, \"There was a slight discomfort just now. It felt a bit weird. How can I explain this... It's like when you let someone into your bedroom for the first time. Although they entered with permission, it's ultimately a little uncomfortable...\"\n\n\"Hmm, I can't observe anything using my mana sense,\" Guy added, to which Goran chimed in with an explanation. \"That's because Al's using his spiritual sense.\"\n\n\"Spiritual sense?\"\n\n\"It's a hard technique to explain on short notice,\" Goran added.\n\n\"Actually, it feels a little like when you showed me that vision of the black hole, Master. Except when you did it, it felt less jarring and more natural,\" Markus commented.\n\n\"What's he talking about?\" Goran asked Guy.\n\n\"Oh, Markus was having some trouble understanding one particular topic. I used a new technique to augment the transmission of knowledge, and it was highly effective, right Markus?\"\n\n\"Extremely! It was an amazing experience. All of my doubts were cleared almost immediately!\" Markus vocalised.\n\nGuy hummed in thought as he digested Markus' earlier comment about the similarity between Al's method and Guy's venture with the use of the mask in his RoK.\n\n'So they're similar... What does that mean?' Guy thought to himself. 'Guess there is only one way to find out!'\n\nAs Guy completed that last statement, he started to feel an ominous premonition. He sighed in defeat and retreated into his RoK. At the centre table, he found the all so familiar mask. He reached for it, and without wasting any time, he plunged it onto his face. He skipped through the uncomfortable feeling washing over him and entered the default state of restrained zealousness.\n\nAfter stabilising himself, Guy opened his eyes and swept his imperious gaze forward to size up his stagnant congregation. Although he had recently accessed The Church to facilitate Markus' revelations, he could already notice a few differences.\n\nUnlike before, Guy found that Markus' ethereal form looked more opaque while seated at the pew upfront. Furthermore, Guy also noticed that the ghostly rope tethering him and Markus from before had also grown brighter, and thicker. What they meant, Guy didn't know. But something urged him that it was a good sign.\n\n\"The boy shines brighter after witnessing the wonders of the True World!\" He preached instinctively.\n\n\"Now, back to business!\"\n\nGuy walked closer to Markus' ethereal form, like last time, and inspected the boy more carefully. Previously, to draw Markus into The Church, Guy simply grasped him by the shoulder. The boy was somehow drawn into this place through contact, the mechanism of which was still a mystery to Guy as he didn't have an opportunity to catch his breath and evaluate it more thoroughly after his breakthrough.\n\nYet, what Guy wanted to achieve now wasn't to pull Markus in, but rather to enter into Markus' core. According to the boy, what he felt just now as Al infiltrated his core was a lot similar to how he felt when Guy brought him here. So by deduction, there has to be a way for Guy to reverse the action from The Church.\n\n\"But how?\" Guy muttered while scratching his chin.\n\nGuy contemplated on it for quite some time and still failed to derive a worthwhile conclusion. Right then, at that moment, Guy started to instinctually feel a growing, sinister sentiment.\n\nFrowning, he started to swivel his head in an attempt to target the source of this discomfort.\n\nLike a metal detector honing in on a rogue metallic interloper, Guy's danger sense started to blare in earnest. It immediately drew his attention towards ethereal Markus' navel, which also happened to be where the ghostly rope extended out from.\n\n\"Is it this?\" Guy uttered while grasping at the rope near its base.\n\nThe moment his hand wrapped around the object, Guy felt his form getting sucked in rapidly through his arm and into the rope. He felt as though he was falling through a dark water slide, twisting and twirling, slipping with increasing speed.\n\nWith an inaudible plop, Guy was suddenly sucked out and dropped at an unfamiliar place that was completely dark.\n\nAfter dusting himself off, Guy looked around and frowned with disappointment.\n\nHe clicked his tongue and bellowed, \"Let there be light!\"\n\nWith two claps of his hand, the room started to brighten visibly, originating from Guy as the source. As the light spread outwards, a peculiar sight entered Guy's line of sight.\n\n\"What the hell is he doing?\" Guy exclaimed as he observed the bizarre visual of Al prostrating himself and peeking his head through a small hole in the ground.\n\nHowever, Guy didn't feel amused. Not one bit! This was because the sinister feeling Guy followed from The Church was originating from that place.\n\nWithout a hint of hesitation, Guy walked over briskly, and tightly grasped onto Al by his shoulders. With a forceful jerk, Guy pulled the man out. \n\nAs Al's head left the hole, the man unleashed a loud gasp and started to hyperventilate.\n\n\"I- I- I'm alive? I'm alive!\" Al exclaimed in disbelief and relief.\n\n\"Tsk! Get a hold of yourself, man!\" Guy bellowed with a furious growl.\n\n\"Guy! Guy? What are you doing here?\" Al retorted.\n\n\"Saving you, of course!\" Guy answered matter-of-factly. Why was he so certain that he had saved Al? He wasn't sure... But his gut told him so.\n\n\"No, I mean... How are you here?\" Al replied.\n\n\"I just came in,\" Guy answered with surety, once again.\n\n\"But- Forget it! I need to get out of here,\" Al stated with a tinge of fear in his voice. Without wasting even a second, Al's figure quickly dissipated from before him.\n\nGuy shrugged his shoulders and, with familiarity, reached out into empty space opening a circular tear similar to the one that deposited him here. He leapt through the hole and returned to The Church. Before retreating to the outside world, Guy removed the mask over his face and shifted the surroundings to the more comfortable RoK.\n\nOutside, Al was fidgeting in his seat, carefully inspecting his body and his own cultivation to make sure that no damage had been done.\n\n\"What's gotten you so riled up?\" Goran asked lightly.\n\n\"Dangerous! Too dangerous!\" Al muttered continuously.\n\n\"What happened in there, Teacher Jeeves?\" Guy asked after exiting the RoK.\n\n\"I was caught off guard,\" Al explained. \"I didn't expect his comprehension of insights to be so... Whatever cultivation method he's practising, it is extremely thorough. There were no weaknesses or lapses, at least by my understanding. This kind of profundity is unheard of! I have never seen anything like it before in my life!\"\n\nGoran noticed Al's voice wavering as he spoke. He had never seen the man so shaken in such a long time. While he was growing increasingly intrigued at the Master-Disciple duo capable of affecting his friend to such an extent, he was also a little anxious.\n\n'Is it safe to leave Jean under their care?' He thought to himself.\n\nThen, with a measured tone, Goran asked, \"What happened in there?\"\n\n\"The region surrounding his nascent core was empty, like an unending void. At its centre, there was a ring of light, which I guessed was his core. In approaching this ring, I saw that it was like a portal. I submerged myself through the portal and found myself in outer space. It was an uncannily precise representation!\"\n\nAl looked towards Markus and with a mix of awe and bitterness, he said, \"Your understanding of outer space is unbelievably accurate. It's hard to fathom that you haven't personally been out there!\"\n\n\"Anyways, after that point, I was greeted by a sight far beyond my comprehension. I don't think I have read anything about what took place after that, and I don't think I can describe it in great detail either. It all happened too quickly! I was assaulted by so many insights that I was completely rendered incapacitated. I didn't expect such intensity from a mage that hasn't even entered Foundation Establishment realm. If not for Guy personally pulling me out, I fear I would have lost myself in there for good...\"\n\nAlmost everyone in the room gasped in unison. To them, Al was a peak they could only ever dream of reaching in their lifetime. And hearing that the man they looked up to nearly lost his life...\n\nAll eyes within the room turned towards Markus, who was casually putting on his shirt. Noticing the piercing gazes, Markus froze comically. The tips of his ears reddened in embarrassment, and he shrunk his head into his neck.\n\nAl exhaled out loud one last time, and asked, \"Tell me honestly -\" He alternated his gaze between Markus and Guy and continued, \"What exactly have you been doing here?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-088]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":131,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 086 - Staring Into the Abyss","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nAl was stumped.\n\nUtterly. Stumped.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBecause he did not know what he was looking at...\n\nBasically, before a mage reaches Core Formation, their so-called nascent core has yet to take a solid shape definitive of their cultivation. At this stage, what one observes when extending their senses into the core is something akin to a pool of water. This pool of water, and the area surrounding it, can be used to gauge into a mages cultivation, only at a superficial level though.\n\nThrough his years, Al had had the opportunity to inspect an assortment of such nascent cores, some through consent and others through force. While he wasn't as ancient as the many Tesseract Transformation powerhouses sauntering through this world, he was confident in declaring that he had seen enough to have a decent idea of the various cultivation methods commonly practised amongst mages, and how the nascent core looked within the mages that practised them.\n\nYet, what Al saw in place of Markus' nascent core was completely foreign to him. The region was blanketed in a darkness so deep that it appeared endless. Usually, in this place, Al would expect to see some shrubbery or ambience indicative of the base nature of the cultivation method. For swordsmen, the region could be a serene meadow with a vast blanket of grass, with each blade capable of slicing through skin. For mages specialising in fire-arts, one could observe a field set ablaze, or a vast and scorching desert, or even woods blanketed in a red hue following the arrival of autumn, or anything along those lines. In some special cases, such as with a particular cultivator practising explosive arts, this region was filled with mounds of malleable white clay...\n\nThis was the first time Al was observing a region shrouded in darkness. Even those infrequent darkness-centred mages didn't have such a nascent core.\n\nAl focused his spiritual senses further and noticed the presence of a small, perfectly circular, pool of water. This pool acted as the true manifestation of one's cultivation. What one observes within this pool is a direct indicator of the insights and processes involved in the cultivation method. Going back to the earlier example, a fire-art practitioner could have a body of molten lava as their core, or a sea of eternal fire. There are additional layers to this, however, but they are usually occluded from those without the ability to decipher these abstract sights.\n\nAl cautiously approached this body of water, which had a bright outline allowing it to stand out within the void. The body was completely still, which was expected since there was absolutely nothing in the environment inducing any disturbances. In fact, it appeared as though the ground itself did not propagate any vibrations into the pool of water.\n\nUpon gazing into the body of water, Al saw more darkness. However, dotted within this darkness were many vibrant spots of bright light. The sight was not dissimilar to stars in the night sky.\n\nIt was very confusing for Al. He had no idea what any of it meant, but he was unwilling to concede - that word wasn't in his dictionary!\n\nWith a mix of apprehension and curiosity, Al moved his hand towards the pool of water. The body of water was small, it barely reached the size of a small pond. It wasn't wide enough to allow Al to submerge his body - at most he could dip one of his appendages.\n\nThe moment the tip of his finger breached the surface, it passed through without opposition. There was no ripple, no indication of contact taking place. It was like the pool was simply a thin, gauzy film waiting to be breached.\n\nAs his fingertips submerged, Al started to feel a biting cold assault his skin. One must note that Al was currently within Markus' core in his spiritual form. Unlike his physical form, the spiritual body hadn't undergone any drastic transformations through cultivation. To augment the spiritual body, one needed to perform continuous introspection and practice abstruse methods. Al had already improved his spiritual body but only through some basic techniques, and so the body's strength was barely comparable to that of a Base Stage Foundation Establishment mage.\n\nWithout the protection enjoyed by his physical body, Al was experiencing a greater range of pain through his spiritual body. After a short moment, Al retrieved his hand and observed its state.\n\nHe noticed that the area exposed to the other side had frozen over drastically. There was also some amount of bloating within the region. Through experience, Al could conclude, \"It's damage caused by lack of atmosphere!\"\n\nIt was the same outcome when one ventured out of Gaea, into space.\n\nAl nodded in contemplation and began exercising a few techniques to augment his spiritual body's toughness. He was planning to do something drastic - he was going to submerge his head through the pool!\n\nIt was a moronic idea! It was never safe for a mage to thrust themself into another's cultivation like this. Imagine a scenario in which a cup, used to hold liquid at high temperature, is quickly dipped into a cold bath. Even if the material can resist those temperatures, the sudden change will more often than not result in the cracking of the cup.\n\nWhen a mage practices one cultivation method, and they attempt to immerse themself in another that may or may not have a connection to their own, the result is often disastrous to the mage. Even if the mage is in an advanced realm. Cultivation deviation does not discriminate by realm, experience, age, gender, or species. It is an equal-opportunity offender.\n\nSteeling himself, Al shoved his head into the pool of water, with his eyes shut tight.\n\nThe moment he felt the environment changing around his facial skin, he slowly opened his eyes.\n\nAfter his vision settled, Al was greeted by the awe-inspiring sight of outer space. With the plethora of stars and various planetary bodies distributed around him.\n\nIn the distance, he could see several constellations, some familiar, others completely new. Further away, he observed a beautiful structure - a wondrous amalgamation of dust, stars and planets, bound together in a beautiful design mimicking a whirlpool. The almost milky-white whirling web emanated an aura of unparalleled and violent strength, as well as serene and poised grace. These antithetical notions constantly assaulted Al's mind. If not for his constant vigilance, Al feared that he would become lost within the spectacle, losing himself forever.\n\nAfter indulging himself in the visuals for a bit, Al decided that it was time to retreat. Unfortunately, he hadn't gained much from this dive.\n\n\"Maybe discussing with Guy and Goran might shed some new light on this,\" Al concluded.\n\nJust as he was about to pull his head out of the pool, something caught Al's attention from the corner of his vision.\n\n\"What's that?\" Al commented as he trained his gaze towards the offending party.\n\n\"It's the Sun!\" Al declared.\n\nAs his gaze sharpened, Al found himself getting pulled towards the solar mass. He stopped a distance away from the solar system - within his view, he could see the presence of the planet Gaea.\n\nAl contemplated on what attracted him here.\n\nHe looked around, to see if anything popped out.\n\n\"The Sun seems... larger than the stars near it,\" Al commented. Unlike the other orangish-yellow masses in the vicinity, the Sun appeared bigger.\n\n\"W-wait, what's happening?\" Al exclaimed. Because suddenly, the periphery of the Sun started to expand outwards.\n\n\"It's growing!\"\n\nThe Sun grew larger and larger. After a few cycles it consumed Gaea, but it didn't show any signs of slowing down.\n\nAs it grew further, the ball turned from its vibrant yellow shade, towards an ominous red.\n\nYet Al didn't see any signs of it slowing down. The red mass grew voraciously, consuming everything within its path. Al frantically retreated to avoid getting decimated by the expanding ball. It was a difficult battle combating the hazardous attractive force exerted by it.\n\nWhile Al kept observing, he eventually found the now red, gigantic ball slowing its ravenous growth.\n\n\"Is it stopping?\" Al pondered. And as if replying to his offhanded comment, the red giant flickered. Its periphery undulated dangerously. It was angry! It wanted MORE!\n\nBOOM!\n\nA flash of blinding light. An explosion of heavenly proportions.\n\nEven within the deafening silence of space, Al could feel the soul-shattering vibrations released by the collapse of the wrathful giant!\n\nClouds of superhot and colourful plasma propelled themselves outwards. Although they were drenched in a dazzling wash of paint, Al could feel the vengeful menace shrouded within.\n\nAl's eyes widened in surprise as the accelerating mist approached him.\n\n\"Oh no!\" Al knew at that moment that there was nothing he could do. He had to escape!\n\nHe quickly attempted to retrieve himself from the pool, but he was already too late.\n\nThe fatal film washed over him, burning through his protection, and threatening to disintegrate his spiritual body. Al grit his teeth and directed his entirety towards maintaining his spiritual integrity and sanity.\n\nHe had to escape!\n\nAl resumed his struggle to get out. But all of a sudden, he was caught!\n\nHe didn't know what it was. But something caught on to him! It was unforgiving and all-encompassing. It was as if a tether was attached to every part, every fibre, every particle of his being, and it was tugging him closer, and closer.\n\nAl's mental alarms blared in distress! For the first time in his entire life, Al was experiencing crippling fear. At that moment, Al know that he was a goner...\n\nAl turned around to face his destroyer, and all he saw was an endless abyss. A spherical mass of indiscriminate death, whose existence contradicted reality in and of itself.\n\nHis body began shutting down automatically as Al got pulled closer to the abyss. The end was nigh, why struggle?\n\nAfter a point, Al saw the sphere warp around him. It was opening its mouth, ready to devour him.\n\nAl closed his eyes and prepared himself for the inevitable.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-087]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":132,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 085 - Closer Inspection","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"I've called Markus over, he should be here soon. The fact that he was able to achieve perfected resonance without having a cultivation method is unheard of in the mage community,\" Al explained.\n\n\"I mean, it's a fact that most mages are aware of, but there is actually a reason behind it as well. How is it that mages are able to manifest such extraordinary powers? How are they able to bend, what you call, the truth of this world in such unbelievable ways?\" Al paused for dramatic effect.\n\nAl pointed towards the side of his head, and explained, \"It is the mind! That is the key that allows mages to play with reality according to their whims. The first step, of course, is for them to comprehend their reality because to modify something without breaking it, one needs to first have an in-depth understanding of it. A thorough cultivation method offers the mage certain insights into their reality that ultimately helps the mage achieve this goal. As the mage gains more and more insight into what they consider their reality, the stronger they get!\"\n\nGuy nodded before asking, \"Then what about cultivators specialising in physical arts?\"\n\n\"The reality to those cultivators is different. For a body cultivator, their reality is confined to what exists on and within their bodies. To a large extent, their environment matters not! As they gain more insight into the way their bodies work, the more their world expands and the stronger they get,\" Al explained.\n\n\"Isn't there only so much you can know about a confined topic such as that?\" Guy retorted.\n\n\"Yet body cultivators do not limit themself as such. Somebody cultivators practice bestial assimilation, in which they modify their bodies by ingesting magical beast blood or parts and integrating their properties into their own bodies. Some sword cultivators train in armoured combat in such a way that their armour becomes a part of their bodies. There are no limits to what mages can do, and how they cultivate. But this does not mean that just about anyone can come up with a new cultivation method. It is always possible to trace back a new cultivation method to one that already exists because most novel cultivation methods are derivations or improvements.\"\n\nRight as Al finished his explanation, Markus knocked and entered the room.\n\n\"Markus!\" Al exclaimed with a smile.\n\n\"Teacher Larks,\" Markus greeted in return, following it with a deep bow.\n\nAl gestured towards Goran and Jean, and introduced them, \"I want you to meet my close friend Goran Rasmus, and his daughter Jean Rasmus.\"\n\nMarkus greeted the other guests with equal reverence. After that, he looked towards the only other person in the room, who was unintroduced, \"Ma'am?\"\n\nJosie looked around curiously, and realised that Markus was talking to her, \"Me?\"\n\nMarkus nodded and then waited for her to respond.\n\n\"Oh! Uhm... I am Josie. I am Young Miss' attendant,\" Josie offered.\n\nMarkus bowed and reciprocated, \"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Miss Josie.\"\n\n\"Just Josie is fine...\" Josie retorted with a wry smile.\n\n\"I cannot do that, Miss Josie,\" Markus denied immediately.\n\nBefore Josie could say anything further, Al interrupted the back-and-forth with an irritated growl, \"Enough of this! Markus, I called you in so hastily with a very important purpose. Quickly now, remove your shirt!\"\n\nMarkus' eyes widened in surprise. His head swivelled around in embarrassment as he observed the expression of everyone else in the room. His eyes immediately landed on the two female guests in the room, and he muttered with uncertainty, \"Now? In front of everyone?\"\n\nJean noticed his pointed gaze and her cheeks started to redden spontaneously.\n\nThe question pulled Al from his stupor. He looked around and took note of everyone's awkward expressions. Al wasn't specifically a prideful person, but he knew that his place in Jean and Markus' hearts wasn't trivial. Correcting himself after committing so fervently would simply lose him too much face!\n\n\"*cough* Of course! Don't worry about Jean, she's training to be a healer so she needs to get used to seeing things like these! Right, Jean?\" Al expertly redirected the conversation to the heavily flushed girl.\n\n\"Huh? S-Sure...\" Jean answered with a low voice.\n\nMarkus cautiously acquiesced and proceeded to remove his shirt. As he did so, he unleashed a sight that would cause many young women to swoon from overstimulation. His chest had expanded markedly and looked more whole, as opposed to before where they had an emaciated look. His lower torso had tightened slightly, highlighting six distinct bulges, perfectly ordered in a three-by-two grid. Due to his young age, these imposing features had an air of immaturity to them that indicated room for growth. From the side of his hips, two large grooves snaked down, straddling his abdominals, towards his...\n\nJean quickly averted her gaze and looked down, attempting to catch her rapid breaths.\n\n\"Goodness! What happened to you? You look so thin! Has Guy been starving you?\" Al asked while throwing an accusatory gaze towards Guy.\n\nMarkus chuckled, while casually responding, \"Much worse, Teacher Jeeves! Master has me fetching multiple pots worth of clay from the nearby spring every day...\"\n\nGuy looked towards Markus with a feigned betrayed gaze and laughed amusedly.\n\n\"The boy's development has tinges of mana ingrained into it,\" Goran commented with a light hum.\n\nAl followed Goran's observation and inspected Markus' physical body with his mana sense.\n\n\"It appears to be the case... This isn't unlike the results obtained through regular cultivation if I'm not wrong,\" Al commented.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"Well. There aren't really many cases documenting the advancements of mages purely through brute force. After all, cultivation is many times more efficient and effective. BUT, there do exist some reports on this matter through rogue mage experimentations. I came across these notes very recently while I was searching for possible solutions to Markus' predicament. In it, it stated that when a mage advanced through brute force, that is by spellcasting, the development of the physical body often gets stunted. The best way to explain it is by considering a house.\"\n\nAl traced certain sections of Markus' body with an extended finger as he continued, \"Advancing through brute force is akin to changing the foundation of the house and reinforcing it with stronger materials. However, if the externals remain the same, it will succumb just as easily to the environment as before. Cultivation ensures that during advancement, both the body and the mind grow together. And as you can see here, although not evident through a cursory glance, Markus does not show any signs of disjointed growth.\"\n\nAl proceeded to nudge and squeeze the various muscle and bone segments on Markus' body and commented, \"They boy has clearly been cultivating. He is literally bursting; he is on the cusp of advancement!\"\n\nMarkus frowned and said, \"But I don't have a cultivation method.\"\n\n\"That's what your Master said as well. Either you two are hiding something from me, which I don't think is the case, or you have been cultivating without realising it, which would be truly remarkable! Nonetheless, our doubt can easily be solved through an inspection of your core. Before proceeding with it, I require your consent,\" Al added.\n\nAs established, a mage's core is the accumulation of the mage's cultivation. It isn't a physical construct, more of a spiritual one. Well, that is at least until they break into the Core Formation realm and reconstruct their bodies, in which the core becomes akin to an additional organ. Yet, even till that point, the shadow of a mage's core exists within their spiritual space, often located at their anatomical core.\n\nNow, the reason why Al asked Markus for his consent before prying into his still nascent core was that it is considered a sign of hostility for a mage to do so forcefully. The core holds many secrets regarding a mage's cultivation. To tamper with it could result in dire circumstances for the mage as it could very easily collapse their entire cultivation resulting in deviations, damages, or worse, death. One can gain partial insight into a mage's cultivation through mana sense, given that there is a difference in realms between the inspector and the target, and the difference favours the inspector. One must note that this information is purely based on a compilation of external factors observed through the mana sense. To gain a more thorough understanding, one needs to delve at a more spiritual level.\n\nAfter Markus readily offered his consent, Al proceeded to place an open palm on the boy's built abdominals and channelled his mana through. He expertly navigated through the spiritual barriers that were natural borne deterrents within every mage. Thankfully, he had Markus' consent and the deterrents admitted him through, otherwise, this would have been more of a challenge, and he would have had to force his way through them. Not that he would have done that, because the result would be the utter crippling of Markus!\n\nOnce he reached the area where Markus' core should be in the spiritual space, he settled his blurry senses to gain a clearer visual. What Al was relying on right now, was his spiritual sense. Spirituality was a branch of magic that was accessible to all mages but has very few uses. In the early stages of cultivation, there is little purpose to it apart from conducting inspections of one's own or other's core.\n\nHowever, this field gains importance once a mage reaches the Core Condensation realm. This is because spirituality plays a huge part in their venture to advance into the Tesseract Transformation realm. Essentially, to bridge the gap from longevity to immortality, one must merge their will and cultivation, represented by their core, with their spirit, represented by their soul.\n\nHowever, delving into that topic was for later. Because the moment his senses regained clarity, Al was greeted by a sight that left him completely befuddled.\n\n\"This...\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-086]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":133,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 084 - Positive Changes","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nMarie paced back and forth in a huff in front of a shamefaced Markus and a silent Grace.\n\n\"Explain yourself!\" Marie demanded.\n\n\"I didn't want to continue studying in the Academy,\" Markus answered in a low voice.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It was a horrible place, Marie!\" Markus retorted with surging emotion, causing Marie to flinch. As he spoke, the mana around him started to fluctuate vigorously as if it were responding to him. This was a natural occurrence with blooming mages peaking into true magehood.\n\n\"They say it is a grounds where great mages are born, but it is actually a crucible where those without any form of support go to die a slow and painful death,\" Markus added.\n\nMarie breathed measuredly to calm her nerves, and retorted, \"You already knew the risks before joining. We told you before you went that magehood is a path filled with brutality.\"\n\n\"I know!\" Markus bellowed causing the ambience to churn violently. \n\nAs he said that, a sudden jolt of rationality struck him and caused his rampant emotions to mellow out a bit. He realised that his aggression was misplaced. He was the one at fault here, and he was in no position to take it out on Marie, even if she was interrogating him doggedly. In fact, it was her right to do so. Both Matron Reva and Marie had done their utmost to dissuade him from pursuing this path, and they both had put forth many rational reasons for it too. Unfortunately, he was too immature at that time to realise it.\n\n\"I. Know.\" Markus reiterated after taking a deep breath to calm himself. \n\n\"And I believed in that till just a year ago, before I met Master Larks,\" Markus continued with a more tranquil tone.\n\n\"Life doesn't always have to be filled with conflict. Sure, friction results in a spark that leads to a burgeoning flame, but what remains once the fire subsides is a mass of ash. I realised, thanks to Master Larks, that I don't have to constantly compete against others to become better.\"\n\nMarie's gaze transformed from disbelief to troubled and finally, after a long time, it settled at acceptance. \"I can't force you to do anything, Markus. We don't work that way. I just hope you can be happy with your decision.\"\n\nMarkus smiled and replied, \"I am. Happier than I have ever been.\"\n\nAt that point, Markus' expression turned serious and he tilted his head in the direction of the guest room.\n\n\"What's wro-\" Marie asked, but she was interjected by Markus, \"Sis, I need to go up front. Teacher Jeeves is calling for me.\"\n\nSaying that Markus hurriedly left the room.\n\nMarie slumped down onto a chair and looked at Grace meaningfully. \"You haven't said anything, Matron.\"\n\n\"What is there to say? You all may be children, but I know that you are mature enough to make your own decisions. I was already against sending Markus to the Academy, but after you changed your mind on the matter, how could I say no. And now that he is back, truthfully, I'm elated. You don't have to go out for months on end to earn scraps, he doesn't have to struggle through hell...\"\n\nGrace sighed and continued, \"All I want is for everyone to stay together. I know I am being selfish in asking this of all of you...\"\n\n\"Matron...\" Marie whispered as she hugged Grace. While embracing her, Marie asked with a serious tone, \"By the way, let's not forget the elephant in the room.\"\n\nSeparating herself from Grace, Marie asked with a frown, \"What do you think about that man? Is he an issue?\"\n\nGrace wore a conflicted expression. She wanted to say one thing, but her conscience refused to let those unfounded accusations leave her mouth. Exhaling out loud in defeat, she confessed, \"He's good.\"\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"It means what it means... Argh! You know what? Why don't you just talk to him, I bet you too will start singing his praises after that,\" Grace grumbled under her breath as her cheeks started to turn a tint of red. For some reason, a certain scene of a lean, shredded and nude man streaked through his idle mind. \n\n\"Matron, you aren't making any sense...\"\n\n\"He's a good person! Okay? He's perfect in every way, is that what you want to hear?\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything...\"\n\n\"Argh! Fine! Whatever!\" Grace stood up in a huff to exit. Right as she walked out the door, she stopped and spoke in a low voice to Marie, \"You should sit in when he teaches. You might find it interesting. Maybe... you'll learn something new?\"\n\nMarie chuckled at Grace's bashful attitude and hummed affirmatively. As she observed Grace's retreating figure, Marie stood up and began touring around the orphanage. Although she had left just a year ago, it appeared as though a lot had changed. The differences were more evident out back. Before what used to lay barren, was now adorned with an assortment of seats and benches, as well as multiple chalkboards. Furthermore, the area seemed to have gained more colour as various small figurines, statues, drawings, designs, and writings were put up on display\n\nAlong the back wall, there was now a sprawling mural displaying a multitude of novel, never-before-seen, scenes each with characters that looked completely out of this world.\n\n\"What are you drawing now? Kano?\" A little girl's voice echoed from around the corner. The mural on the wall had seamlessly blended around the edge as if the colours flowed like a tranquil spring through a forest.\n\n\"I-I-t's a dragon! He's called Smaug!\" A little boy answered.\n\n\"He looks vicious!\" Dora replied with a shudder.\n\n\"He is! He single-handedly annihilated one of the most p-p-prominent kingdoms of Dwarves! Under the Lonely Mountain,\" Kano explained animatedly.\n\n\"Wah! He's so horrible! I don't like him,\" Dora commanded.\n\n\"Just wait, Dora. The scene isn't finished. I can't stop halfway,\" Kano reasoned.\n\n\"But I hate him! He sounds like a meanie!\"\n\nThere was a pause in the conversation. Right as Marie was about to turn the corner and call out to Kano and Dora, the little girl spoke up in a voice filled with uncertainty, \"Kano? Can you ask Teacher Larks to give me the next chapter of the comic you showed me yesterday?\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask him yourself?\"\n\n\"Argh, Kano! Please do it... Pleeeeease? Please. Please. Please. Plea-\"\n\n\"Fine! I'll ask him. B-B-But why are you being so difficult? Just talk to Teacher Larks.\"\n\n\"I want to... But I'm afraid that he will hate me?\"\n\n\"Why would you think that?\"\n\n\"The old lady from the village never liked me. She said that I was unruly and impolite. It wasn't my fault! You know how hard it is for me to concentrate with all the voices!\"\n\n\"Maybe you should talk to Teacher Larks about it. He helped me w-w-with my dyslexia, maybe he could help you with yours?\"\n\n\"I guess...\"\n\nMarie's eyes widened in disbelief as she digested the information from around the corner. 'Kano has dyslexia? What is that? He can read now? And what is this about Dora hearing voices? What the hell happened while I was away?'\n\nShe shook her head, cleared her thoughts and called out, \"Kano! Dora! Are you guys there?\"\n\n\"\"Sis! You're back\"\" Two elated voices responded. The twins hopped out and rushed towards Marie with bright smiles glowing on their faces. Marie was once again shocked at the sight! Mainly because this was the first time she had seen Kano smile so wholeheartedly. Since his childhood, the boy was constantly sulking or crying, he was the embodiment of depression if there ever was one. But now, it was as if his entire personality had undergone a 180-degree shift. Maybe the boy itself was abducted and replaced by an imposter. If not for his now intermittent stutter, Marie feared that it might be true!\n\n\"Did you draw all of these, Kano?\" Marie asked with an encouraging tone.\n\n\"I did! Do you want me to explain them?\" Kano replied with an expectant gaze. Marie nodded while picking him Dora.\n\n\"This is the Big Bad Wolf,\" Kano explained. \"He's the worst!\" Dora added, \"He destroyed the little piggy's houses, and ate little red riding hood's grandma!\"\n\n\"Dora! I w-w-want to explain,\" Kano said with a wronged tone.\n\n\"Anyways, this is a Genie,\" Kano continued. \"He's good. He can grant you three wishes!\" Dora interjected mischievously.\n\n\"DORA!\" Kano bellowed angrily. \"I'm not talking anymore.\"\n\n\"No! Please Kano. Dora, stop annoying Kano, I want to hear him speak,\" Marie reprimanded lightly.\n\n\"Humph! He's just showing off all the books he's read,\" Dora retorted while folding her arms.\n\n\"You're just jealous that Teacher Larks gave me all the books and gave none to you!\" Kano uncharacteristically egged Dora.\n\n\"Am not! I bet he will give me just as many books as he gave you if I ask him!\" Dora talked back.\n\nKano stuck out his tongue as a provocation, causing Dora to reach out to grab him.\n\n\"Stop it! You two, what have I told you about fighting?\" Marie said sternly.\n\n\"\"Throat-jabbing, biting, eye-gouging, and crotch-stomping are off-limits when fighting against family members. Everything else is fair game.\"\" The twins recited monotonously.\n\nMarie coughed in embarrassment and immediately corrected them, \"No! Fighting is off-limits! We must use our words! Now apologise to each other and call it quits!\"\n\n\"Sorry Kano\"\"Sorry Dora\" the twins muttered half-heartedly and slumped away, leaving Marie by herself.\n\nMarie rested her hands on her hips and stared blankly at the colourful wall.\n\nIf there was one thing Marie was proud of about herself, it was her skills in handling numbers. Maybe it was her superior aptitude, or maybe it was through her years of practice after swimming in the deep end, Marie didn't know. What she did know was that there wasn't anyone better than her in a 10-kilometre radius. In fact, even with all the unsavoury rumours about her lurking around the Merchant's Guild, and regardless of her young age, she was always the most sought after when it came to short-term finance managers or consultants. And it was precisely because of her skills and perceptivity with numbers. \n\nThrough her work, Marie had become an expert in gauging and catching mistakes, errors, and oversights through a single glance. Her mind could notice trends and falsifications in financial records as though she were reading a children's book.\n\nThis ability of hers also translated to real life.\n\nAs Marie swept her gaze around the orphanage, her mind started to churn at a rapid pace, crunching some imaginary numbers and forming corollaries.\n\nThere were many unbelievable and drastic changes in and around the orphanage. Of what she had seen, all of them had been positive in some sense. Markus had become more assured and confident. Kano had come out of his shell and was putting himself out there. The old, drab and dull orphanage had now gained some colour and liveliness.\n\nAnd all of these changes could be tracked down to one deviant variable.\n\n\"Teacher Larks... Maybe I just might sit in and see what all the fuss is about?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-085]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":134,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 083 - Reunion","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nThe leg of the journey from Wayward Town to Twilight Village was unbearably uncomfortable due to the charged atmosphere. Having learnt of Markus' \"asinine\" actions, Marie turned eerily silent. However, rather than tranquillity, her current composure resembled that of a malefic bomb at the cusp of exploding.\n\nMarie assumed her seat at the carriage leading the caravan, which also happened to be occupied by Uncle Jeeves and Jean's Father. Jean had tried to reason with Marie and asked her to accompany her in the carriage, but Marie immediately declined, stating that, \"It was her job to guide\". However, Jean could already glean that it was all a facade. Marie was probably hoping to be as close as possible to the front so that she could charge at Markus the moment they arrived.\n\n\"That girl... is a bit vivacious,\" Josie commented.\n\nJean nodded affirmatively and exhaled with mirth. \"She is fun!\"\n\n\"The Young Miss must not associate herself with people like her,\" Josie said morosely.\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"The Young Miss is of a higher stature and background!\" Josie affirmed righteously.\n\nJean hummed in thought, and followed up with a question, \"Would mother avoid people \"below her\"? Is it right for a healer to discriminate against people just because they are of a different socio-economic class?\"\n\nJosie immediately corrected herself by stating, \"However the Young Miss has more responsibilities! The Young Miss is not just a prospective healer, she is also the next leader of the Rasmus Clan!\"\n\n\"It's still quite early to declare that...\" Jean interjected with a wry intonation.\n\n\"The Young Miss must not get disheartened! This slave firmly believes that the Young Miss is -\"\n\n\"\"destined to soar through the heavens!\"\" Jean and Josie both said at the same time. Jean immediately followed up by asking, \"What if I don't want to soar through the heavens? What if I just want to dwell in the world of mortals and make it better?\"\n\n#Humph! Are you even worthy to make such a declaration?!#\n\n*Don't listen to her! You can do it!*\n\n____\n\nJosie looked down with a crestfallen expression. 'Madam, the Young Miss is so much like you... I am afraid I can no longer dissuade the Young Miss from following in Madam's footsteps. I can only pray that I can protect the Young Miss from the many dangers of the world. I must not fail Madam's final task of keeping the Young Miss safe!'\n\nRight as Josie's internal soliloquy reached an end, Marie declared from the front of the caravan, \"We've arrived!\"\n\nOnce the carriage stopped, Jean and Josie exited, along with Al and Goran. Marie hopped down from the carriage and walked forward, towards a narrow path sloping upwards. Unfortunately, the path wasn't wide enough to accommodate the carriage, and it seemed that their destination was at the end, hence everyone started to trudge along the unfinished passage.\n\nJean was growing increasingly anxious and excited with every step, given the prospect of finally achieving her dreams. Goran was equally excited for the very same reason. Josie didn't display any outward emotions, except internally she was both conflicted and assured. The former, because she didn't want her Young Miss to face the dangers that followed stepping into the path of magehood, and the latter because she firmly wished for her Young Miss to find her happiness. \n\nAl was simply elated to meet Guy once again. He had built a close friendship with the man and really wished to continue many of their unfinished conversations. Marie, though, was simply growing angrier and angrier with each step. After a point, her rage was so evident that it overpowered everyone else following her.\n\nAnd like that the group finally reached the orphanage at the end of the path. Before they could take another step, a masculine voice, familiar to some and unfamiliar to others, resonated from behind the building.\n\n\"W-Wait Grace! Let me explain, it's not what you think!\"\n\nThe frantic pleas were immediately doused by an angry feminine voice, \"Shut up! You PERVERT! I should've known... You're all the same! I thought you would be different. But how could you do this? And that too, to a little boy?! Get over here!\"\n\nAl and Goran immediately extended their mana sense to examine the fracas. After observing the scene, their expressions warped in confusion. Al was straight up stumped at the sight, however, Goran's expression slowly turned into a frown. Before Al could voice out his doubt, a seminude figure ran out from behind the building with a wronged expression. Following the figure, was a fully dressed female waving a stick vigorously.\n\n\"Stop right there!\" the woman shrieked.\n\n\"I'll stop if you'll listen to my explanation!\" the man retorted.\n\n\"Matron please! Master didn't do anything!\" a boy, around 13 years of age, rushed behind the woman and pleaded.\n\n\"MARKUS!\" Marie shouted as she rushed towards the boy waving another stick, which had seemingly materialised out of nowhere.\n\n\"Sis, what are you doing here? Teacher Jeeves? Oh no! Sis wait- I can explain! No!\" And with that, the scene devolved into utter chaos.\n\nTwo men, one old and another young were both being chased by two women, one old and another young, both of whom were waving a stick.\n\n____\n\nKrish's lips twitched in embarrassment as he observed the slapstick routine. He wanted to walk over and intervene, however, he held himself back considering the presence of the three new mages.\n\nHe was somewhat familiar with the Core Condensation mage called Al Jeeves. He was a noteworthy figure in the kingdom, and his name was spread far and wide. However, Krish had heard that the man was an infamous recluse.\n\n\"So what is he doing here?\" Krish muttered his doubt out loud.\n\nThe other two weren't so familiar. The unknown man was also at the Core Condensation realm, albeit gauging his cultivation indicated that he had only recently broken through. One must note that for a Tesseract Transformation realm, immortal, recent could be deciphered as anywhere within the last two decades.\n\nThe unfamiliar woman was less noteworthy as she had only reached the Core Formation realm. An inspection of her cultivation and state of core integrity told Krish that this may be her final stop in magehood. Her cultivation had reached a bottleneck many years back and had thus stagnated ever since. If she couldn't ease through that bottleneck since then, it was highly unlikely that she would achieve anything different now.\n\nThe last person of unknown origin was just another mortal girl. A deeper inspection into her didn't offer anything special, so Krish simply left it at that.\n\nHe then sighed out loud and resumed his watch, while suppressing his growing annoyance.\n\n____\n\n\"Whatever... Just... I would appreciate it if you didn't strip in front of the kids...\" Grace muttered while scratching the back of her head embarrassedly.\n\n\"*sigh*... Again, Grace, it wasn't a voluntary action,\" Guy added in defeat.\n\nThe awkward display that took place in front of the orphanage simmered down once the two women tired themselves out. Guy had superior stamina due to his recent breakthrough, and although Markus was still in the Late stage of Mana Condensation realm, his constant training had given him an increased edge over his sister. Once the two ladies were subdued, Guy explained his piece succinctly and appeased Grace after much trouble.\n\nMarie, however, was not yet fully convinced and pulled Markus away in order to properly grill the chap.\n\nBefore Grace left, she handed Guy a change of clothes, who immediately adorned them to address the guests.\n\n\"Teacher Jeeves! It's so good to see you again. I apologise for that display earlier,\" Guy said with a smile while shaking the man's hand.\n\nAl laughed mirthfully and replied, \"I sort of figured what happened after I noticed that you had broken through to Foundation Establishment. Congratulations!\"\n\n\"Thank you! It just sort of came out of nowhere, and caught me unprepared,\" Guy replied with a bitter smile. He then turned to face Goran, Jean and Josie and said with a respectful tone, \"It's an honour to meet a few of Teacher Jeeves' friends. Honestly, I'm grateful that he has someone else to depend on. I worried that he would one day disappear into the books at the Academy library, without anyone to drag him out.\"\n\nGoran chuckled at the joke and answered, \"My name is Goran Rasmus, this is my daughter Jean Rasmus and her attendant, Josie. The pleasure is all ours, Teacher Larks.\"\n\nGuy immediately waved his hands and corrected Goran, \"Oh no! I don't think I legally qualify for that title.\"\n\nGoran smiled mysteriously and added, \"I'd rather not get entangled with all those technicalities. In my books, anyone capable of training a budding mage to achieve perfected resonance at such a young age is more than qualified to call themselves a teacher!\"\n\nGuy's eyes narrowed with suspicion. He turned to face Al, who responded with an equally mysterious, yet warm smile.\n\n\"I'm not sure I-\" Them something hit Guy. Before he could voice out his realisation, another voice shrieked in surprise, \"Markus achieved perfected resonance?!\"\n\nIt was Jean, who reacted a little uncharacteristically, attracting the adult's attention.\n\nGoran immediately widened his eyes at his daughter's outburst and said to Guy, \"I apologise for my daughter's disrespectful behaviour.\"\n\nHe then looked at Jean meaningfully, to which the girl followed with her apology, \"This one begs for Teacher Larks' forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Come on now! Let's not act so formally. In fact, I empathise with your reaction. You just happened to voice out my thoughts before I could,\" Guy replied so as to assuage the parties.\n\n\"Speaking of which,\" Guy continued. \"Are you sure, Teacher Jeeves? To my knowledge, for someone to achieve perfected resonance, they need to meld perfectly with their cultivation method.\"\n\nAl nodded in confirmation, \"That is correct. What's the issue?\"\n\n\"See that's the thing... Markus does not practice any cultivation method. So how was he able to achieve perfected resonance?\" Guy said with an unsure tone.\n\nWhen he finished, everyone looked at each other thoughtfully.\n\n\"That's... intriguing...\" Al commented.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-084]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":135,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 082 - Fast Friends","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Is that my Markus? Woah! He looks so handsome now! Was he always this handsome? No, it's the confidence! And strength!\" Marie exclaimed animatedly as she drilled her gaze into the visual from the recording artefact.\n\nAfter acquainting herself with Marie, Jean decided that it would be a good idea to bring her along as they travelled to Marie's village. As the daughter of the head of a prolific clan, Jean had learned quite early in her life the benefit of forming bonds and building relations.\n\nHowever, knowing the importance was one thing, actually putting things to practice was a whole other ball game. Thanks to Jean's default impersonable and cold expression, she often found it hard to build a good rapport with other people. Whenever she tried showing genuine interest in others, it was taken as her being patronising and condescending. Forget about making friends, because Jean didn't have anything in common with all the other young mistresses. They would go on and on about boys, outfits, jewellery, or cosmetics... But Jean wasn't enamoured by any of that, and without the capacity to express a different emotion, it was impossible to build even a surface relationship.\n\nBut Marie was... different. There wasn't any subterfuge or deception here, the girl basically wore her emotions on her sleeves. To top it all off, Jean didn't have to actively try and appease the other party by expressing a different emotion, or an emotion that contradicted her thoughts, every other moment.\n\n'Is it because of her upbringing?' Jean thought to herself. Marie was extremely personable. Jean didn't even have to do anything on her part. In fact, the moment she professed that she was somewhat knowledgeable about Markus' existence, Marie seamlessly infiltrated into Jean's company. It was some hardcore parkour that stumped even Josie, who had a few additional years in her belt.\n\nMarie first bridged the physical gap between them by reducing their proximity. Next, she bridged the social gap between them by asking, \"You seem to be younger than me... Around the same age as Markus? Wonderful! Why don't we talk casually, hmm? Adding honorifics in every sentence is so exhausting, right Little Sis?\"\n\nThat wasn't a request, apparently... Josie kept grumbling about Marie's shamelessness. Jean was confused because she didn't see anything shameless about it - Jean didn't mind it at all. She too preferred to talk casually as it saved her a lot of time. This was another aspect that Jean was averse to when interacting with the young mistresses within her social circle. Conversations were never straightforward. Every sentence had layers of subtext. Even the most seemingly innocent of statements could harbour vicious jabs directed towards the recipient's deepest insecurities. Sticks and stones may break bones, but those can be healed with a single spell. Words... They could leave scars that last for a lifetime...\n\nJean shook her demoralising line of thought and reverted her attention to her self-declared Big Sis. It was difficult to continue a decent conversation amidst the moans of the grovelling men in the alley, so Jean invited Marie to her room at the inn, much to Josie's discomfort.\n\nAlong the way, Marie bombarded her with various questions aimed at intuiting her connection to Markus.\n\n\"How do you know Markus? Where did you guys meet? Are you guys studying together? Ahh, are you his girlfriend? No! Don't tell me that he wronged you in any way?! If that little brat did anything untoward, this Big Sis will get revenge for you!\" Marie declared while thumping her chest righteously. Evidently, she had already devised an entire narrative through a self-directed call-and-response.\n\nWith a wry expression, Jean interjected Marie's monologue and said, \"Big Sis... Actually, I haven't personally met Markus.\"\n\nMarie's eyes widened in surprise. \"What? Then how do you know of him?\"\n\nJean sheepishly scratched the back of her head and uttered in a low voice, \"I saw him in a recording...\"\n\n\"A recording?\" Marie retorted.\n\nAnd so, Jean greeted Marie into her room and fetched the recording artefact documenting Markus' fight against Gaige.\n\nThen right as Markus first appeared within the frame and cast his first spell, Marie exclaimed in awe, \"Is that my Markus? Woah! He looks so handsome now! Was he always this handsome? No, it's the confidence! And strength!\"\n\nAs the fight progressed, Marie accented each scene with an appropriate, \"Ooo!\" or \"Aaa!\" \n\nWhenever something magnificent occurred, like the mini-explosion spell cast by Markus, she would tack an \"Awesome!\" followed by a series of enthusiastic claps. \n\nWhen Gaige was pelted with the acidic mist, Marie flinched and sucked in a cold breath through her teeth, \"Ssssss! That was brutal.\"\n\nJean exhaled mirthfully through her nose as she observed Marie's apropos reactions. For some reason, her current viewing of this recording seemed to feel a bit more enjoyable.\n\nHowever, the warm atmosphere came to a sudden halt right as Gaige unleashed a violent bellow and painted the stage black with his spell. Marie frowned with trepidation. Although she wasn't a mage, for some reason, the blanket of darkness evoked a sense of immense discomfort from within her.\n\nThe moment the dark blanket enveloped Markus and caused him to collapse, Marie moved towards the edge of her seat and grasped onto it tightly, with visible anxiety in her gaze.\n\nMarie exhaled in relief as she saw the darkness retreat, allowing Markus to stand up on his feet. However, it was short-lived as immediately after, Markus collapsed like a ragdoll.\n\n\"Markus!\" Marie exclaimed as she darted up. \"I'm sorry, Jean. I don't think I can act as your guide. I need to go in the opposite direction.\"\n\nShe then muttered to herself as she anxiously paced around the room searching for something, \"Maybe there will be a caravan going towards Radiant City...\"\n\n\"Umm, Big Sis?\" Jean said, only to receive no response from the discombobulated Marie. \"Big Sis!\" Again, no response.\n\n\"MARIE!\" Jean bellowed uncharacteristically, finally pulling Marie out of her fugue state.\n\n\"Huh? Jean? I'm sorry we can't continue our conversation. But I need to go to Radiant City. Markus is hurt...\" Marie was about to reenter her earlier spiral, but Jean quickly caught her this time.\n\n\"You don't have to go to Radiant City. We are actually going to Twilight Village to meet Markus and his Teacher,\" Jean said quickly to assuage Marie.\n\n\"To Twilight Village? What is he doing there?\" Marie asked as she narrowed her eyes.\n\nRight as Jean was about to answer, a series of knocks interrupted her.\n\n\"It's the Lord and Teacher Jeeves, Young Miss,\" Josie added.\n\nJean nodded in affirmation, allowing Josie to answer the knocks.\n\n\"Jean!\" Her father said as he walked into her room. \"We will be leaving early tomorrow. The way is clear, but one can't be too careful,\" he added casually. However, his eyes locked on the unfamiliar person accompanying his daughter.\n\n\"Who is this?\" Her father asked cautiously.\n\n\"This is Marie Reva. I met her outside at the market,\" Jean answered.\n\n\"Marie Reva... Marie Reva...\" Her father muttered repeatedly as if trying to recollect something.\n\n\"Reva! Are you related to Markus by any chance?\" Another voice asked from behind her father. Uncle Jeeves hopped in and scanned Marie with eager eyes.\n\nNoticing the almost predatory gaze from this unknown man, Marie immediately raised her guard. Noticing this event, Jean intervened and answered in Marie's stead.\n\n\"That's right, Uncle. Marie is Markus' elder sister.\"\n\n\"Ah! So you're that Marie! Markus has told me so much about you,\" Uncle Jeeves responded with a smile.\n\nMarie tilted her head and asked, \"My apologies, but may I know who you might be?\"\n\nUncle Jeeves smacked his head to feign apology and answered with a chuckle, \"Right! I'm Teacher Al Jeeves. I was one of Markus' teachers. Well, sort of. I kind of ended up in that position by coincidence.\"\n\nMarie's eyes widened and she bowed immediately with reverence, \"A thousand apologies, Teacher Jeeves! This lowly peasant offers her gratitude to Teacher Jeeves, for teaching this one's untalented younger brother.\"\n\nUncle Jeeves immediately waved his hands with embarrassment and replied, \"Please don't say that! In truth, I wouldn't have taught Markus if not for his true teacher's, no, his Master's involvement. If anything, you should be thanking him!\"\n\nMarie nodded wholeheartedly and added, \"This one just saw her younger brother's bout against another student. Seeing as he is injured, this one will take her leave. There should be a caravan leaving for Radiant City soon...\"\n\nMarie's voice trailed off near the end.\n\nUncle Jeeves furrowed his brows and said, \"If you're leaving to see Markus, why don't you come with us?\"\n\nAt that moment, Marie remembered hearing that Markus was at Twilight Village and blurted, \"Right! Jean, you said that Markus was at Twilight Village. Why was that? Isn't he supposed to be at Radiant Academy?\"\n\n\"Oh, Markus dropped out,\" Uncle Jeeves answered matter-of-factly.\n\nThe room welcomed an awkward silence after that statement. Marie stared at Uncle Jeeves blankly as though her mind was rebooting after hearing some utter nonsense.\n\n\"Markus did what?\" Marie asked flatly.\n\nBefore Uncle Jeeves could answer, Marie, screamed in outrage, \"HE DROPPED OUT?!\"\n\n\"So... you didn't know...\" Uncle Jeeves murmured while biting his tongue.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-083]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":136,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 081 - Fateful Encounter","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGoran and Al set out for Guy's village with Jean a few days later. While Goran, Al and Josie could fly using magic, Jean could not, thus they decided to make the journey the 'mortal way'.\n\nHowever, in order to not attract unwanted attention from wary clan members, bandits, and ne'er-do-wells, they opted to take a simple, unassuming looking caravan. It would blend in with the other caravans traversing the route.\n\nAlthough they shouldn't have to fear such intrusions, given their cultivation realm, Goran and Al both agreed that it was unwise to broadcast the fact that two magic powerhouses were travelling together to a remote village. Spreading this would obviously raise multiple red flags, especially within the mage circles.\n\nThe caravan they travelled in was comprised of two carriages. The one leading the group was for Al and Goran, while the other, more comfortable one was reserved for their precious cargo, Jean.\n\nThankfully, their travel was generally pleasant and without any hindrance. They managed to reach the midway point, a transit town known as Wayward, which acted as the junction where most merchant caravans rested prior to continuing the long journey through the forest and the mountain range.\n\nOver the years, the town had evolved from a quaint residential gathering into a more commercial centre, open to trade. Thus, the streets of the town were filled with temporary stalls that were set up on short notice by these travelling caravans. Apart from these haphazardly raised stalls, the town also acted as a means of short- to long-term employment for those seeking means to earn money. People could access the merchants or other trade guilds established within the town and respond to advertisements seeking hands.\n\nAlthough the town appeared vibrant and lively, it had actually persisted since before the start of the current dynasty. The Maika Duchy recognised the value of this town, especially due to its closeness to Radiant City, and had made it a point to maintain and protect it from elements both internal and external.\n\nTherefore, to enter or transit through the town, one had to undergo a thorough check by the guards stationed near the peripheries, documenting every single being that set foot within the confines of the town.\n\nFor entities such as Goran who had the backing of a prolific clan, bypassing this documentation process wasn't a hassle. All it took was flashing the clan leader's seal and greasing the palms of the guard captains with a few gold coins, and they were personally escorted to the most luxurious inn in town by the captains themselves.\n\nAfter settling down in the inn for the day, Goran and Al decided to fly ahead to make sure that the path was safe for the next day's travel.\n\n\"I'm a little bored, Josie,\" Jean said with a sigh. \"I've been sitting in the carriage the entire day. Although it can dissipate the shocks, I still feel quite sore.\"\n\n\"This servant will massage the Young Miss at once,\" Josie suggested.\n\n\"No. Instead, I want to go out for a stroll. Check out the market!\" Jean declared with some excitement, although it was not evident on her expressionless face.\n\n\"But Young Miss, Lord said that it would be best if we stayed put...\"\n\n\"Come on, Josie! With you around, what's the worst that could happen? I mean, unless we cross someone at the Core Formation realm or above, you should be able to take them down. Besides, with the guards maintaining vigilance on those entering and exiting the town, I don't think we will have any problems,\" Jean replied to persuade Josie.\n\n\"Young Miss, we should not test fate by making such claims,\" Josie said with a bitter smile.\n\n\"Whatever, Josie I'm going!\" Jean declared while sauntering out of her room.\n\n\"Young Miss... Please don't rush...\" Josie uttered with a sigh of defeat.\n\n____\n\n\"Tsk... These herbs are all in their last legs...\" Jean commented as she left the last stall in the row.\n\n\"That is expected, Young Miss. The stalls mostly sell goods that are prone to perishing during transit through the forest, damaged during transportation, or exceeding caravan capacity. That is why they are at a lower price point since the merchants want to recoup their losses, and optimally break even,\" Josie explained.\n\n\"That makes sense...\"\n\nAs the two walked back towards the inn, a strange conversation drifted out from a nearby alley.\n\n\"Let go of me you creep!\" A forceful feminine voice resonated.\n\nSLAP!\n\n\"Damn it! You bitch! This is what I get after taking pity on you and giving you a job?\" A growling masculine voice retorted, tinged with anger.\n\n\"If I had known that sleeping with the employer was part of the job description, do you think I would have accepted your offer?\"\n\n\"Why else would I have given such an important job of maintaining the caravan's finances to a girl of all people?\"\n\n\"I don't know, maybe because you were a decent human being?\"\n\n\"Get back here!\"\n\nJean scooted over and peeked around the corner leading into the alley and observed the confrontation. She saw a girl, maybe a year or two older than herself, being surrounded by a group of men, led by a hefty man.\n\nSeeing how the girl was at such a disadvantage, Jean felt distressed and whispered to Josie, \"Should we help her out?\"\n\nJosie answered, \"Lord said to not draw attention to ourselves, Young Miss...\"\n\n\"But she's outnumbered...\" She said bitterly and said, \"How can I call myself a healer if I can't even help a defenceless person?\"\n\nJosie released a long exhale in contemplation and moved forward to step in. However, before she could do so, a series of familiar sounds interrupted her.\n\nBANG! CRASH! PLOP!\n\n\"AAGH!\"\n\nJean peaked around that corner once again, only to notice the girl standing over the prone body of the fat man, with all of his thugs rolling in pain on the ground. The girl stomped on the fat man's crotch and spoke menacingly over his wails, \"Do you think this is my first time? Please! See this knife in my hand? This has emasculated many reckless employers such as yourself. You can ask the merchants guild representative here. They call me 'The Man-Unmaker'. I bet you never even considered looking up my credentials with the guild, right?\n\nShe leaned forward and spoke with a low yet threatening tone, \"I'm gonna be lenient with you since you were nice enough to actually pay me on time, and include me on two tours. That is the only reason you are walking away today with your dignity intact. There won't be the next time, understood?!\"\n\nThe fat man nodded vehemently in fear, to which the girl declared, \"Good!\" before stomping down on his crotch once again.\n\nAs the girl walked away, one of the men rolling on the floor got back up on their feet and unsheathed a knife from their ankles.\n\n\"Crazy bitch!\" He yelled while rushing over to her turned back.\n\nThe girl turned to face her assailant, surprisingly without a tinge of fear in her eyes. Yet, before the knife could plunge down on her chest, the man was frozen in place. Not metaphorically, literally frozen in place, in a mass of ice.\n\n\"It is unwise to turn one's back to the enemy, especially if said enemy is still alive and breathing,\" Josie said as she stepped forth.\n\nThe girl observed Josie with an incisive gaze before saying, \"Thank you for your help, but I had it under control.\"\n\nThe girl jerked her cuffs to reveal a hidden dagger, and grinned deviously. \"As I said, this wasn't my first time.\"\n\nThe grovelling men paying attention to the confrontation all shuddered in fear at her bold declaration.\n\n\"Nonetheless, I am grateful for your intervention. Not everyone would do so in such circumstances,\" the girl said while bowing towards Josie.\n\n\"You shouldn't thank me, but the Young Miss. It was she who took pity on you,\" Josie corrected while directing her hand towards Jean.\n\nThe girl bowed once again towards Jean and said, \"Then this peasant is infinitely grateful towards the Young Miss for her benevolence.\"\n\nJean quickly waved her hand and replied, \"Please! It wasn't anything.\"\n\n\"No! I disagree. While I declared that I could have handled the situation, there was no guarantee of my survival. So in many ways, your intervention tilted the scales in my favour. Hence, I am indebted to you. However, I do not like being in others' debt since it is often hard to quantify. Furthermore, it is also weirdly subject to interest over time. Therefore, I would like to repay this debt immediately by offering my services in any way possible,\" the girl replied with a serious expression.\n\n\"I... I don't know what to say,\" Jean confessed.\n\n\"It matters not. I can do anything. I have a lot of experience working as a finance consultant or treasurer for merchant caravans. I have also worked extensively as a cleaner, cook, handmaiden, you name it,\" the girl replied enthusiastically.\n\n\"I also have a lot of experience travelling around these parts, I can act as a guide if that is necessary.\"\n\nHearing the last part, Jean's eye lit up, \"Do you happen to know a village called Twilight Village?\"\n\nThe girl seemed taken aback by that question. She replied cautiously, \"I do... I am from Twilight Village.\"\n\n\"That's great! We are actually travelling that way. Since you are so hell-bent on repaying your debt, why don't you act as our guide?\" Jean asked while glancing at Josie from the corner of her vision.\n\nAfter a quick analysis, Josie relented and gave a nod of affirmation.\n\n\"Sure! Then I will be at your service,\" the girl said while bowing for the third time.\n\nJean nodded and introduced herself, \"I am Jean Rasmus, and this is Josie. We will be under your care from now on.\"\n\n\"My name is Marie Reva, you can call me Marie,\" The girl responded.\n\nJean furrowed her brows upon hearing her name, \"Reva... Are you related to Markus Reva by any chance?\"\n\n\"Markus? How do you know Markus?\" Marie bombarded back in shock. \"Did he do something stupid to cross you in any way? Please, I apologise on his behalf! He's a stupid brat, I'll punish him personally. You know what, I will do it in front of you until you are satisfied!\"\n\nJean's eyes widened in surprise while Josie chuckled from behind.\n\n\"It seems that our meeting here was fate,\" Jean blurted in a low tone.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-082]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":137,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 080 - True Competition","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"This is amazing!\" Goran exclaimed in elation. \"Where is Guy?\" He said while jumping up from his seat.\n\n\"He's in a village a few days away from the city,\" Al answered.\n\n\"That's great! I'll invite him over!\" Goran declared as he began to walk out. But he was quickly stopped by Al.\n\n\"No, don't!\"\n\n\"Huh? Why?\"\n\nAl wore a serious expression and suggested, \"I think it would be better if we went to him.\"\n\nGoran frowned, \"And why is that?\"\n\n'*sigh* I hope he isn't one of those arrogant and conceited teachers who let their success go to their heads...' Goran muttered internally. However, Al's response completely surprised him,\n\nWith a bitter smile, Al elaborated, \"You should already know by now just how fond of Guy I am. But haven't you wondered why I didn't actively seek to keep him here in the academy? It's because I don't want him here!\"\n\nGoran's eyes widened in disbelief.\n\n\"Even though he lost during the tournament, it was within my authority to override his termination and take him under me. But I chose not to do that since I didn't want him to remain here. It was because this isn't where he's supposed to be.\"\n\nGoran furrowed his brows and said, \"That doesn't make any sense! Why isn't he supposed to be here? The academy is the perfect place to nurture a teacher with great potential. They will have access to the required resources and the support from the powers backing the academy.\"\n\n\"But you seem to forget what occurs behind the curtains. Sure, he would have access to the required resources, but you skip the fact that to qualify for the best resources he would have to suffer through a brutal competition against his peers to rise above the ranks and stand out. Certainly, he would get the support of the academy, but with that, he would also gain the irk of the powers opposing the academy,\" Al explained.\n\n\"But isn't that necessary? To achieve greatness, one must overcome these brutal competitions, right?\"\n\n\"That's now how Guy works,\" Al retorted while shaking his head. With a light chuckle, he continued, \"To Guy, true competition is when two competitors enter a rivalry with the sole purpose of growing stronger, together. They learn from each other through their bouts and offer support to the other when necessary. That is the only way that everyone can improve.\n\nHowever, when two competitors treat their rivals as simple stepping stones, they will never truly advance. Because all they are doing is pushing the other person below them, while they remain in place.\" \n\nGoran then commented in a low voice, \"That... is pretty insightful...\"\n\nAl nodded proudly and said, \"That is why I didn't want you to drag Guy back here. In fact, I'm sure that he will thrive more in that village. For some reason, I get the feeling that it is his true calling!\"\n\n\"Then... What do you suggest?\" Goran asked.\n\nAl gazed at Goran and Jean, and declared, \"We should go to him!\"\n\n\"To the village?\" Goran retorted in disbelief.\n\n\"Yes!\" Al affirmed. \"What do you think, Jean?\"\n\nJean alternated her gaze between her father and Al. In truth, she was still pretty dazed after successfully casting her very first spell.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"How would you like to travel to Guy's village, to meet him?\" Al asked with a hopeful expression.\n\nWithout pausing to think, Jean said, \"Yes!\"\n\n____\n\n\"...Do you surrender?...\" A boy's voice echoed for the first time within Jean's boudoir. Jean gazed ardently, for the thirteenth time, at the stoic figure of the boy named Markus, in the projection from Uncle Al's recording artefact.\n\nAfter they'd decided to travel to meet the - now unemployed - teacher named Guy Larks, Uncle Al handed Jean a recording artefact showing the result of the teachings of Teacher Larks.\n\nSince then, she had immersed herself into the contents of the recording, with the aim of decomposing every single detail hidden within.\n\n\"I don't understand this spell... Josie, have you ever seen this spell before?\" Jean asked while pausing the recording at a frame.\n\nJosie walked closer and observed the frame carefully.\n\n\"To answer Young Miss, the spell appears to be similar to |Acid Mist|,\" she answered with a respectful tone.\n\nJean hummed in affirmation, but retorted, \"But isn't that at least a Tier-2 spell?\"\n\n\"To answer Young Miss, it is.\"\n\n\"Then how was he able to cast it?\" Jean interrogated.\n\n\"To answer Young Miss, I do not know.\"\n\nJean exhaled loudly and started to note down her observations into her personal journal.\n\n\"It appears that Teacher Larks has found a way to allow a Late stage Mana Condensation mage to cast spells a little beyond their level. The initial hypothesis is that it is related to the enchanted weapon called the 'Magic Wand'. Alternatively, it may also have to do with the modified spell circle,\" she muttered.\n\nThis was how Jean worked. Even though Jean had no aptitude for magic, she tirelessly pursued the field of medicine and healing. The reason why affinity to magic is important for a healer, is because mana increases their capability to perform a diagnosis and implement treatment regimes for their patients. In some cases, mana allowed a healer to skip the use of any medical drugs altogether, simply stimulating the cells and vitality of the patient through expertly controlled mana circulation.\n\nBut without the capacity to exploit this feature, Jean was forced to develop means and methods to overcome the limitation.\n\nIn the end, she formulated a highly rigorous and methodical strategy to approach any problem. This method sought to isolate every possible variable that could affect the outcome of a scenario and evaluated their effects through controlled tests. It was a time-consuming process, but Jean found that it was often equally, if not more, accurate than the established strategies, in which physicians would seek out the closest existing solution and perform tweaks starting at that point.\n\nJean lay down her writing utensil and returned her attention to the recording.\n\nAs she drilled into Markus' every action, subtle or otherwise, the voices in her head sprang into another debate.\n\n*Such a capable lad! He managed to rise to Late stage of Mana Condensation realm through effort alone!*\n\n#That I agree. But do you think that Jean can achieve the same outcome? Hmph! She's weak, incompetent, stunted, trash!#\n\n*Stop deriding her! You can do it Jean!*\n\n#Psshht! Look at him, and then look at yourself. You're a waste of air, Jean. You should just kill yourself!#\n\n\"ENOUGH!\" Jean screamed.\n\n\"Young Miss? Is there a problem?\" Josie quickly walked up to the inflamed Jean.\n\n\"... Nothing... Umm... Josie?\" She asked.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Do you think it will work? Consulting Teacher Larks, I mean,\" Jean added with evident doubt and uncertainty in her voice.\n\n\"To answer Young Miss, this slave has said it before and will say it again: this slave firmly believes that Young Miss is destined to soar through the heavens!\"\n\n\"That's just false hopefulness-\"\n\n\"This slave may be presumptuous to ask this, but why does Young Miss firmly believe that she will fail?\"\n\nJean lowered her head and said, \"We've failed so many times already...\"\n\n\"But Young Miss, to borrow from miss' own words, unless we test it out, we should not readily write out an unexplored possibility as a foregone conclusion.\"\n\n\"But if all we ever face is failure, what confidence is there that the n-th outcome will be anything different?\"\n\n\"Miss seems to forget that this time, it was not a failure. Miss managed to incite a flame using magic. Does that not count for something?\"\n\nJean sighed and confessed, \"It's just... I'm scared... What if this doesn't work out? What will happen to father?\"\n\n\"Young Miss should not preoccupy herself with such worries. Miss should remain hopeful because this slave firmly believes that miss is-\"\n\n\"\"destined to soar through the heavens!\"\" Jean and Josie said together. To that, Josie acted out of character and chuckled lightly which was met by a forced, yet apt smile by Jean.\n\n\"The boy was unfortunate to have met a mage with Abyssal Wyrm Bloodline,\" Josie commented as the recording approached the scene where Markus was crushed by Gaige's outburst of power.\n\n\"Have you ever experienced how this felt, Josie?\" Jean inquired.\n\nJosie nodded and said, \"Once. Back when I was under the late Madam, we happened to cross paths with an Abyssal Wyrm. In fact, the late Madam met the Lord during that confrontation.\"\n\nJean's ears perked with interest as she paused the recording and turned towards Josie with a curious gaze.\n\n\"The late Madam and this servant were travelling through the forests of the Narue region in search of a rare herb known to contain an abundance of the decay-nature. We traversed day and night, through the dank and murky forest, until we stumbled upon a massive cavern, which was known to house this herb. Unfortunately, what the information failed to contain, was that the cavern was also home to an Abyssal Wyrm!\"\n\nJosie paused for effect, and continued, \"The late Madam did not know of this at first, so she casually walked in. However, a large burst of oppressive power enveloped us and threatened to crush us into a fine dust. It was power beyond anything this slave had ever felt before. It was the first time that this slave felt true helplessness and fear. Thankfully, both this slave and the late Madam had sufficiently advanced cultivations to be able to withstand the assault, as just a minute after, a group of mages stumbled upon the cavern and noticed our plight. The man leading the group, the Lord, did not hesitate twice before jumping to action.\"\n\n\"The Abyssal Wyrm had sensed the presence of additional intruders and showed itself - a woman with beauty beyond comparison. She had raven black hair, deep blue eyes, and a slender and seductive figure. However, the vision was only short-lived, because the wyrm recognised the threat and immediately morphed into her true form. A slithering, elongated mass of unrivalled terror - an abomination of the highest order. Its entire body was coated in darkness - one couldn't recognise its face if not for the presence of four unblinking, bone-white balls marking its eyes. When it opened its mouth, rows and rows of domineering teeth welcomed us, ready to tear us into nothingness. This slave is still unable to fathom how an alluring and elegant figure could hide such a horrific presence...\"\n\n\"To conclude the story, the Lord and his companions, with the assistance from the late Madam and this slave, managed to overpower the Wyrm and drive it out of the cavern. But the Young Miss should note, that the late Madam and this slave were only able to survive the Wyrm's attack due to the Madam's unrivalled background as a healer. By the time the Wyrm's oppressive power had retreated, both the slave and the late Madam were left with shattered bones and perforated internal organs. Our survival was nothing short of a miracle.\"\n\nJean turned back to the recording and resumed right as the scene approached the point where Markus stood up after experiencing the overpowering attack of the Abyssal Wyrm bloodline.\n\nAs she saw the boy's broken yet impressive figure rise up, Jean hummed affirmatively and commented, \"Markus... What an impressive boy...\"\n\nAs she finished that statement, Jean started to feel her cheeks warming up for some reason.\n\n\"Young Miss? The miss' body seems to be heating up all of a sudden. This slave will fetch her some water immediately!\"\n\nJean felt her forehead to confirm that she was heating up. She felt her neck and muttered, \"Heart rate increasing? What... just what is happening to me?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-081]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":138,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 079 - Small Flame in the Darkness","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nIn the following hour, Al gushed unceasingly about the personage known as Guy Larks. He was so enthusiastic in describing Guy, that even Goran was drawn in.\n\n'I've never seen Al talk so eagerly about anyone!' Goran commented internally. In fact, ever since he'd met Al, Goran had never seen Al praise anyone! So in seeing him shower such gracious praises to this as of yet unknown character, Goran already had a high opinion on Guy.\n\n\"And you heard about the Dwarven Metal alternative, called steel, that The Burning Forge's been advertising, right? Well, half of the credit in creating that alloy actually goes to Guy! Karmin Zola came in personally and foisted a bunch of gifts and weapons on me as a sign of gratitude,\" Al added.\n\n\"So that's why the clan received a gratuitous shipment of steel weapons and armours from The Burning Forge. That man Karmin's a true-to-heart, sly businessman! But I've got to give it to him, though. He does know how to maintain a consistent quality with his products. And steel really isn't something to joke about! The clan verified the claims that steel is a true alternative to Dwarven Metal, and the elders were all confounded by how close it was to the real deal!\" Goran responded with amazement.\n\nAl nodded and responded, \"I know. If not for the minor inconsistencies in carbon composition, you could sell it off as Dwarven metal.\"\n\n\"What's carbon?\" Goran retorted.\n\n\"It's an element that is contained in all living organisms. In fact, it is the element that the coal in your hand is composed of,\" Al answered.\n\n\"Where did you get that from?\"\n\nAl unleashed a wide smile and declared, \"Guy Larks! Let me tell you, that kid has the most insane theories, and the interesting thing is that it is possible to verify all of them. So-\"\n\n'There he goes again...' Goran sighed. He nodded along as Al continued to gush about Guy. In his mind though, he was assessing whether the man could be of use to his daughter. Having tried the novel spell circle that produced fire, and witnessing just how little mana it consumed, Goran was now a little hopeful about his daughter's prospects. On top of that, after hearing that another kid without an aptitude for cultivation was able to advance to the Late stage of Mana Condensation realm, he was even more fired up.\n\nTherefore, while Al was rambling, Goran sent a voice transmission.\n\n'Josie, please call Jean up to the salon. Uncle Jeeves is here to see her.'\n\n'But my Lord, Miss just changed out into her workwear.'\n\n'It's fine! Just tell her to come as is. And hurry!'\n\n\"You're not paying attention,\" Al said dejectedly.\n\n\"No! No, of course, I am. You were speaking about something called a wand?\" Goran retorted without breaking a sweat.\n\n\"Right, the magic wand! This was something Guy made. Do you remember that article I was talking about a few years ago? The one by Maine Baxter on her 'Incomplete Tests and Theories'?\"\n\n\"Of course I do...\" Goran said sarcastically.\n\nAl bit his tongue apologetically and elaborated, \"It was about variable enchantments. That is, inscribing an enchantment capable of exhibiting multiple enchantments.\"\n\n\"I vaguely recollect you talking about it. I think you said that it was 'stupid, pointless, and utterly devoid of any meaning whatsoever,\" Goran chimed in.\n\nAl smiled embarrassedly and muttered, \"And yet you remember that?\"\n\n\"Anyways, I was totally wrong back then! Guy took the idea and turned it into something with unrivalled applications. As you must have already realised, that modular spell has a much lower mana cost. The magic wand is imbued with a special version of the variable enchantment, of his own design, that further reduces the cost by offloading the burden of maintaining spell integrity at longer ranges onto it. It was so effective that I was able to cast an unlimited amount of |Fireball| spells without pause!\"\n\n\"That's amazing!\" Goran exclaimed. \"Do you have this wand with you?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately I don't. He only made one, and that was for his student. I never thought about asking him to disclose the formula either, it's bad manners, right?\"\n\nGoran nodded in understanding. Then, as if anticipating something, Goran and Al both turned towards the door to the salon and wore a gentle smile. After a quick half-minute, they heard an audible knock.\n\n\"My Lord. Young Miss Jean is here,\" Josie's respectful voice resonated from the other side. Immediately after, the door opened and a teenage girl walked through.\n\nShe wore a simple, yet evidently overused apron over an equally simple and overworked outfit that screamed practicality. There were no additional adornments that indicated individuality or frivolity. Nor did she wear any jewellery that highlighted her sharp and exquisite features.\n\nHer hair was tied up in a tight bun, leaving a small string cascading over her forehead onto her face. Her expression was stagnant, unwavering. To any stranger, it would come across as cold and uncaring. Just like a haughty princess, filled with disgust, and unempathetic of those under her station.\n\nHowever, Goran and Al were unfazed by her look, since they knew that it wasn't voluntary. She just couldn't outwardly express any elevated emotions. Not because she was unwilling to, but that she was unable to do so.\n\n\"Good morning, Uncle Jeeves,\" the girl spoke and bowed lightly in Al's direction.\n\n\"Jean! Stop being so formal. Come! Sit!\" Al beckoned wholeheartedly.\n\nIn response, Jean simply nodded and approached the empty set next to her father.\n\n\"You called, Father? Is it to discuss the new findings from the last tests?\" Jean asked while gazing in Al's direction. Assuming it to be the case, Jean started enunciating her discovery, \"Uncle, following the previous tests with the latest iteration of the cure, we came across a few weird phenomena-\"\n\nBut before she could continue, Goran quickly interrupted her and urged anxiously, \"Wait! Before that! Jean, the reason I called you here is to tell you that your Uncle might have finally found a solution to raise your cultivation.\"\n\nJean sighed and said, \"Father... We've tried everything, haven't we? Even Teacher Way, who everyone's been gossiping about, said that I don't have any future in cultivation...\"\n\nGoran shook his hand and said, \"Who cares about him?! Forget about what that arrogant prick sputtered! Here, take these!\"\n\nGoran shoved the sheet of paper with the modular spell drawn on it, as well as the lump of coal, into Jean's hands and looked towards her expectantly.\n\n____\n\nJean gazed at the two inconspicuous items in her hands and looked back at her father in confusion.\n\n#Look at what you did to your father! He's become an idiot!#\n\n*There has to be a reason! He wouldn't just hand you a lump of coal without any purpose.*\n\nAs if he had heard the debate running within her head, Goran elaborated, \"The sheet has a spell circle drawn on it. I want you to cast that spell.\"\n\nJean nodded in understanding and evaluated the spell circle. As her eyes scanned the intricate lines and designs within the drawing, her brows furrowed in confusion.\n\n\"What spell is this?\" She asked out loud. It was something she had never seen before.\n\nOne must know that for the longest time, Jean and her father had been tirelessly pursuing ways for her to cultivate. For her father, the reason for this was to persuade the clan elders of Jean's competence as the future leader.\n\nBut for Jean, this pursuit held a higher purpose. No matter how much Jean crammed various medical knowledge, alchemical formulae, and factoids on herbology, it wouldn't change the fact that she would be nothing more than a regular, mortal physician.\n\nJean's one and only dream was to follow in her mother's footsteps and become a healer. And after personally witnessing her mother's demise, this dream had turned into an unwavering resolve.\n\n'No child should have to see their parents die!' She declared at that time.\n\nHowever, the first step into becoming a healer, if not the most important step, was to become a mage.\n\nThis was something that Jean, after a long and arduous search, had learned was an impossibility for her. Her difficulty wasn't that she couldn't understand the multitude of cultivation methods stored in the clan's vaults, nor was it that she was crippled in some way and unable to circulate mana.\n\nThe problem was something more profound, and rather intangible. The issue was housed within her mind, in the form of the two entities that constantly bickered amongst each other, one of whom regularly egged her to end her own existence.\n\nCultivation is a process that requires immense concentration and immersion. This was something Jean was cursed to never be able to achieve.\n\nAfter facing repeated rejections and failures, Jean was ready to give up. Yet her father was not. And honestly, Jean was not eager to burst her father's bubble either. In many ways, she found that this search was one thing that kept her father from entering a self-destructive spiral.\n\nSo, Jean continued to entertain her father and also immersed herself in the search. She looked through countless cultivation methods, memorised nearly all the spells available to her level, internalised countless theoretical books on magic, all in the hopes of finding something that might be of aid to her.\n\nThus, she found it odd to see a spell that had a design completely unlike anything she had ever seen before.\n\n#It... It looks so beautiful!#\n\n*It truly is! There is order in the design. Not like those haphazardly drawn ones!*\n\n'Wait a minute! You both agree?' She responded.\n\nTo that, she received nothing. The voices had turned speechless, for the first time in her entire life!\n\nJean gulped loudly and followed the spell circle with her utmost concentration.\n\nShe placed the sheet of paper on the table and started to form the spell circle in her free hand. The process was seamless, as she had performed this step countless times before. However, compared to those other times, Jean somehow felt a little hopeful in facing the completed spell circle.\n\nFor the first time since forever, Jean prayed, 'Please work...'\n\nJean channelled her mana towards the spell circle and waited.\n\nImmediately after, the spell circle started to rotate, and from its centre, a small mote of fire materialised.\n\n\"It... It worked...\" she uttered in disbelief.\n\n\"It worked!\" Her father added with overwhelming joy in his voice.\n\n\"Of course it works! You should trust in Guy,\" Uncle Al affirmed smugly.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-080]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":139,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 078 - Putting in a Good Word","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\n\"What brings you here today, old friend?\" A heavy-set man with well-defined musculature approached Al while spreading his arms out for a friendly hug. He had a rugged face with a squared jaw and an aggressive gaze that could cause a child hiding behind a metre-thick wall to burst into tears, metaphorically.\n\nAl reciprocated with a smile, while once again contemplating how such a brutish looking fellow could find employment as a healer. Funnily, Al fit snugly within the man's massive embrace. He didn't mind one bit how the man's undulating biceps, exposed to the environments through a coat truncated at the shoulders, crushed him at his upper back. Because Al knew that underneath the scary exterior lay a gentleness unlike any other. \n\n\"Do I need an excuse to meet a friend?\" Al joked.\n\n\"Of course YOU do. There has to be a particular reason for your decision to venture out of your little hiding hole in the library, apart from your many 'cultivation walkabouts',\" Goran chided jokingly.\n\nImmediately after, though, Goran's smile faded and he added with a more morose tone, \"If it's about that thing, then I'll have to disappoint you again friend. Even the most recent tests with the updated cure failed to persist past the ten-year mark.\"\n\nAl nodded with a disappointed expression, and added, \"I didn't have high hopes for the new formula. How could only changing the catalyst improve the efficacy of a potion? If that was the case, I would have developed a cure many years ago!\"\n\n\"It didn't hurt to try. Besides, we managed to glean substantial data from this most recent trial. You wouldn't believe it, but it was my little girl who found out that we were actually pursuing a completely false lead! The drought wasn't caused purely by magic. Sure, it played a role, but the true culprits were apparently an almost imperceptible, non-sentient, primal organism.\"\n\n\"No way! If it were as you stated, then Formula number 103 should have completely wiped it out as it implements a targetted decay tactic. No living organism should have survived through that!\"\n\n\"That's the thing! This organism is neither living nor dead. It doesn't make sense, but you need to hear how Jean described it. She said that it was similar to how the common cold affects mortals. Genius, right? Who would have thought to look there?\"\n\n\"Living, yet non-living...\" Al muttered in recognition. His mind started to operate at Mach speed, going through different theories and the possible implications of this new discovery. But before he could descend down that rabbit hole, he caught himself.\n\n\"Right! Before that, I wanted to ask. What was Teacher Jo Way doing here?\" Al inquired.\n\nIn response, Goran sneered in derision and retorted, \"I called him here because I wanted to see if he could be my girl's teacher. I heard a lot of good things about him, figured he might hold the answer to Jean's problem.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Hmph! He said that she didn't have any aptitude for cultivation. He said that because of the treatment from Mage Baruchel, her mind was too fractured to be able to assimilate insights. How would he know that it was because of Mage Baruchel's treatment that she is so stable now? She...\" Goran's voice quivered and he started to get choked up as he progressed.\n\n\"She even tried to kill herself before, you know? Thank heavens that Josie was there, otherwise, I would have lost my little girl... Just like Nyla...\"\n\n\"There is some truth to Jo Way's statement, Goran. After the treatment, she's become very... closed off.\"\n\n\"I know! But you were there before. You saw how she used to be. Fine one minute, destructive the next. Happy one second, completely distraught the next. She even started hurting herself, saying that she killed Nyla and she deserved to die. And Mage Baruchel was the only one who provided a viable solution. There was no other option!\" Goran explained.\n\n\"At least now... she... She's fine... right?\" Goran muttered as he tried to reason with himself.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Goran. I shouldn't have drawn you and Nyla into my problems,\" Al offered dejectedly.\n\nGoran shook his head. \"It wasn't your fault, Al. It wasn't anybody's fault. Nyla was the one that wanted to get involved. You know how she was? A true healer! When she saw just how much devastation that abomination unleashed by Ziva had caused, she couldn't stop herself. Even I couldn't have stopped her.\"\n\n\"But I MADE Ziva-\"\n\n\"No. He made himself. I know the kind of person you are. You wouldn't have actively driven that kid to become such a... monster!\"\n\n\"But I didn't stop him when I had the chance. I encouraged his behaviour. Praising him for his genius...\"\n\nAs he grovelled, Al realise that he had strayed from his initial intention. And so he quickly inquired, \"By the way, why are you so fervent about getting her to start cultivating?\"\n\n\"The clan elders believe that she isn't capable of leading the clan. Stating that since she is a girl, she doesn't have the proper bearing of a clan leader. Instead, they want those two turds of my nephews to lead the next generation,\" Goran sneered.\n\n\"I tried explaining to them about her situation, but do you know what they told me in response? To get remarried and birth a boy! Ha! The only way to assure that my little girl will succeed me is if she displays her strength as a mage. And that's why I've been searching for a good teacher. Can you please reconsider your oath?\" Goran pleaded.\n\nAl shook his head firmly, but then he smiled. \"To tell you the truth, I've reneged on my oath already. But I'm afraid that even I might not be able to teach your daughter.\"\n\nGoran furrowed his brows and retorted, \"Stop joking with me, Al. Just tell it to me straight if you don't want to teach her.\"\n\nAl waved his hand and continued, \"Let me finish! As I was saying, I may not be able to teach her, but I've found someone who just might!\"\n\nBefore Goran could respond, Al produced the recording artefact and handed it to him. \"Watch this!\"\n\nGoran took the artefact with scepticism and activated it with his mana. Immediately, a projection materialised before him, displaying a scene of two kids trading pointers.\n\n\"Isn't that Gaige Bori? He's Teacher Jo Way's student-\"\n\n\"Not him! Keep an eye on his opponent,\" Al interjected.\n\nInitially, Goran observed the fight without much interest. He had lived for a long time, and had witnessed and been part of grander confrontations in his lifetime. What meaning did a measly fight between two mortals, barely able to wield basic magic, hold to him?\n\nYet his comments were caught in his throat the moment he saw the kid cast a spell completely foreign to him.\n\n\"What was that spell?\"\n\n\"Wait is that a |Fireball|? ... That's an |Earth Spike|! ... |Water Jet|! Al these spells don't look anything like what they're supposed to be, yet they seem to produce the intended results!\"\n\nAl smiled and responded, \"Keep watching.\"\n\n\"Tsk, the kid has technique, but he's overusing his mana. He'll exhaust himself, I'm afraid.\"\n\nBut Goran's prediction fell flat on its stomach after the confrontation continued without any sign of fatigue.\n\n\"How is he able to sustain himself for so long? Does he have some sort of a special physique or bloodline? Or is it an artefact?\"\n\nAl denied immediately. \"He's a regular, average, boy from a rural village.\"\n\n\"Impressive! Some of these spells are extremely potent. Especially that modified |Acid Mist| spell, and that mini-|Explosion| spell. Gaige is tiring out, I'm sure the boy will win.\"\n\nOnce again, Goran's prediction was proven false as Gaige unleashed a wave of darkness centred on him.\n\n\"Damn! Abyssal Wyrm Bloodline! No wonder Jo Way advanced to a teacher so quickly. He found himself a gem!\"\n\nThe recording neared completion immediately after, ending with the boy's loss. Right before it ended, Goran observed the recording waver frantically, as though the person using it was rushing in distress.\n\n\"It was an impressive display, I'll admit. That boy sure used a lot of novel spells. He's definitely a good seed. Maybe with some decent backing, he'll soar! Too bad he was pitted against someone with such an overpowering bloodline. But what's your intention, Al?\"\n\nAl smiled mysteriously. \"That boy's name is Markus Reva. He came from a rural village a few days away from this city. A year ago, he was stuck in the Early stage of Mana Condensation realm, unable to find a suitable cultivation method. He was the kind of student every teacher in the world would look over, saying that he had no aptitude for cultivation.\"\n\n\"But what if I told you that he managed to reach the Late stage of Mana Condensation realm within a year, without any boosting potions, or artificial aids of any sorts.\"\n\nGoran raised his eyebrows in disbelief, \"But how? I thought you said that he didn't have a suitable cultivation method. Did he find one through some form of a chance encounter?\"\n\n\"It was a chance encounter alright, but not one that gifted him with a cultivation method. No, to date he remains without a cultivation method. What he found was even better: a gifted teacher!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. Did he push himself to the Late stage through brute force? Don't tell me! It was those spells wasn't it?\"\n\nAl nodded aggressively and handed Goran a folded parchment as well as a piece of coal. Upon opening it, Goran was met with an intricate design that reminded him of one he saw in the duel.\n\n\"It's almost the same as what that kid cast, but not quite... What's this coal for?\"\n\nAl instructed Goran on how to cast the spell, to which Goran complied.\n\nAfter he materialised the spell circle, Goran activated it without difficulty, resulting in a small mote of fire forming in his palms.\n\n\"I don't believe it! It barely used any mana! Now I get it. If he cast this spell a few thousand times, his mana channels would widen without a doubt! Are you saying that this was achieved because of a teacher? Who is this man?\"\n\nAl chuckled mirthfully, and answered proudly, \"Guy Larks!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-079]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":140,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 077 - Seeking Investors","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nAl lowered the recording artefact and looked blankly at the wall of his office in silence. He'd watched the fight between Markus and Gaige over 50 times. Each time, he approached it with a different perspective, hoping to find something, anything, that could've offered a chance towards Markus' victory. Yet with each watch, he would end up getting disappointed.\n\n\"It's truly unfortunate. To face someone with the Abyssal Wyrm Bloodline... Markus couldn't stand a chance...\"\n\nAnd that was the entire truth. In fact, through his admission, Al wouldn't have been able to trounce over Gaige if he had been in Markus' position. It was a sad realisation and spoke volumes of how advantageous having a superior lineage was for a mage. After all, if it weren't for Gaige's bloodline, Markus was guaranteed that victory!\n\nAl read through the letter Guy left for him once again, with a dejected expression.\n\n\"Here's another unfortunate victim of this stupid tradition...\" he sighed.\n\nAlthough there was sound reasoning behind the academy's decision to hold the apprentice tournament, there were many times when Al saw promising teachers slip through the cracks due to unforeseen or unfortunate circumstances. In this case, for instance, although Al recognised Guy's tenacity and impressive teaching style, he could do nothing about the tragic outcome since the student that was participating in Guy's name had lost the match.\n\nThere are so many details that are important and need to be taken into consideration when evaluating a teaching apprentice's efficacy apart from just teaching their students how to cultivate and fight with magic. It was also important to assess a teaching apprentice's ability to inculcate proper values in their students, especially when it comes to the use of magic. Furthermore, it was also imperative to test the apprentice's open-mindedness, willingness to go above and beyond for the benefit of their students, patience, and so on.\n\nAs he mentally listed these factors with great vigour, Al paused and started to chuckle wryly.\n\n\"Why am I describing Guy?\"\n\nAl realised that after working with Guy and interacting with him, he had changed his perception of what a teacher needed to be. Al never had any qualms with the way the academy conducted its business, or how it pitted teaching apprentices against each other in what could only be known as a free-for-all dependent heavily on luck and chance. In fact, he even used to agree with this method. There was an oversaturation of teachers in this world, why bother training them when it was possible to pick prospective - lucky - teaching apprentices from a seemingly endless pool of choices.\n\nThrough experience, Al knew that the lucky ones that survived the culling process were capable of advancing by themselves. And those that failed to do so would simply fall through, making way for newer - lucky - blood to take their place.\n\nWho cares about stability and capability when it actually came down to teaching students? Wasn't being powerful a reasonable indicator of how effective a teacher someone could be? After all, how could you become so strong if you didn't have a veritable reservoir of knowledge backing you up? Wasn't it easy to just say a few words, provide a few insights, maybe correct a few errors along the way? The students could handle the rest - how can they expect to grow stronger if they cannot even cultivate by themselves. What about those students that couldn't decode the almost cryptic insights offered by mages many realms above who had a more abstract view of the world? Well, they just weren't lucky, or maybe cultivation wasn't meant for them!\n\nAnd that last point also highlighted the fatalistic nature of cultivation and magehood. It was a truly dog-eat-dog world that heavily favoured those fortunate and lucky. What use was methodic training and hard work if all it took to advance was a nonsensical fortunate encounter that compressed decades of effort into minutes? There had been many situations when Al had lost opportunities to other mages who just happened to be in the right place at the right time or had the exact key needed to crack some form of code that would let them benefit from a chance encounter that Al had toiled endlessly to pursue. At those times, he would simply convince himself that he had been unfortunate, or that they were rightful victors of the game of chance that was life.\n\nBut now that he thought about it, the whole system was whack! Observing the world of cultivation from Guy's out-of-the-box point of view had enlightened Al of the fact that regardless of the many discoveries and advancements made in the field of magic over the thousands of years, the world had remained stagnant. They either rehashed an existing theory into a different package or offered another theory without any strong evidence supporting it. If observed from a detached perspective, one could truly see that the world hadn't moved forward at all in the last 6000 years.\n\nHowever, whenever Al interacted with Guy and discussed the almost revolutionary theories Guy proposed, he could envision a brighter future. He just knew that Guy was the answer, the much-needed solution, to push the world forward. He would bring this world to a new, more awesome age, beyond Al's realms of comprehension. And yet the messiah who was meant to change the world had become the unwitting casualty of a system that formed the foundation of the existing, stagnating, mage society.\n\nYet no matter how much Al wanted to overturn the Academy's decision to bring back Guy into the fold, he just couldn't bring himself to do it. Not because Al didn't have the authority to enforce that action. No, he was more than capable of doing so. No one would question twice if he were to demand the reinstatement of Guy. Moreover, Kaist would be thrilled and would comply without a second of thought. The issue was that Al didn't want to bring Guy back into this toxic environment.\n\nAlthough Al had confidence in Guy's positivity, he didn't want to taint the man's bright mind with the disgusting politics and undercurrents that prevailed within and without the Academy's campus.\n\n\"It's better if he stays in that rural village. I'm sure that he'd thrive even more in that environment! I'm thankful that Markus also decided to drop out. That boy has a promising future, but only if he stays with his Master,\" Al said with surety.\n\nStill, Al very much wanted to be a part of the process. He had thoroughly enjoyed the past year, observing Markus' growth and exchanging novel ideas and concepts with Guy. Even his cultivation had advanced by a significant amount within that short time period.\n\n\"The rural village won't offer much in terms of opportunities or resources...\" Al muttered to himself.\n\n\"Right! I could do something to direct beneficial resources that way. Maybe... I could be a part of it as well,\" Al added with a light chuckle.\n\nAn interesting thought materialised in his mind that compelled him to visit one of his oldest friends.\n\nAl ventured out of the Academy's grounds before casting a spell for flight. He hovered higher into the air, before zooming out southwards, towards the more prolific section of the city. His destination was the local household of the Rasmus Clan, one of the frontrunners in the field of healing and medical alchemy.\n\nAlchemy was a wide field of study that encompassed many specialisations. Combat alchemy focussed on poisons, boosters, and so on. There were also fields that focussed on transfiguration, control, enchanting of the mind, etc. Apart from those, there was a particular field of alchemy that was widely recognised and was generally deemed of utmost importance, and that was medical alchemy. The practice of brewing healing potions covering a multitude of illnesses, injuries, disabilities, and discomforts.\n\nIn this field, the Rasmus Clan happened to be the pacesetters. Their roots ran deep. In fact, they existed even before the Age of Isolation, which was merit in and of itself. Since most clans from back then had vanished through the years, for one reason or another.\n\nAl's primary intention in approaching the clan was to conjure a valid excuse to approach Guy once again. He chose this clan for two reasons. The first was that the current Clan leader was one of his closest and oldest friends, and he wouldn't think twice before directing a few meagre resources in Guy's direction. But it wouldn't be fair for Al to impose on his friend like this if it wasn't going to benefit him.\n\nHowever, Al was certain that Guy could hold the answer to his friend's most personal trouble. And that was the second reason.\n\nAs he approached the mansion, Al slowed down and lowered himself back onto the ground. He could have easily flown into the premises, but it was often a sign of ill-intent to do so. He walked up to the guards at the front gates, who readily moved aside as they recognised Al's face. They offered a courteous smile and bowed with respect as Al entered.\n\nUpon walking through the bountiful front garden, up to the mansion's entrance, Al spotted a familiar figure being led out from the back entrance. Al focused his mana sense and confirmed the figure's identity as Jo Way.\n\n\"What was he doing here? And why is he being led out the back?\"\n\nAfter a closer inspection, Al noticed that Jo Way was wearing an awkward frown. It was as if he was disgruntled and ashamed at the same time.\n\n\"Did something happen?\"\n\nAl remembered Guy's infrequent comments of how \"nothing good can come from messing with Jo Way.\"\n\nAl frowned while in thought, but then he quickly denied the ominous feeling encroaching him, \"I'm just overthinking things...\"\n\n\"No... I should probably warn Goran... Just in case...\" Guy may joke often, but he was a wise man. Al knew that for a fact.\n\nNonetheless, Al continued his approach towards the entrance to the mansion, shelving his current thoughts for later.\n\nAs a close acquaintance of the owners of the mansion, he faced little opposition as he walked through the entrance. Even the servants were intimated with Al's presence and readily guided him towards the salon, where their master was currently staying.\n\nAl didn't even need to open the door to the salon before it burst open by itself and a man walked through with a hearty smile on his face.\n\n\"Al! How's everything? What brings you here today?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-078]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":141,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 076 - Nightmares","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\"Jean don't come closer!\" The woman screamed anxiously, as she conjured a quick |Gust| spell to push the little girl, barely 5 years old, away.\n\n\"But, Mommy-\"\n\n\"Stop!\" The woman interjected the girl's pleading words and began circulating through a series of spells haphazardly, yet at the same time familiarly.\n\nWith tears streaming down her cheeks, Jean rushed towards her mother, only to face a rigid yet transparent screen blocking her.\n\nShe curled her tiny palms into a fist and began hammering them away at the screen while crying out vehemently.\n\n\"Mommy, no! Please let me in!\" She screamed out, only to receive an apologetic expression from the woman beyond the screen.\n\nHer mother looked at her with a worrying gaze, which transformed into dismay and despair. She too approached the screen and placed a free hand against it, opposite Jean's. A lone tear tumbled down from the woman's eye and collided against her warm and caring smile.\n\nJean looked up at the familiar face and wiped her tears with the cuffs of her dress.\n\n\"Please let me in, Mommy,\" she pleaded.\n\nHer mother opened her mouth to answer, but then she stopped.\n\nJean looked on with confusion as the familiar face of her mother contorted to display emotions completely unlike her.\n\nWith a devious sneer, the woman said incisively, \"You did this!\"\n\n\"Mommy?\"\n\n\"If only you had stayed at home, I wouldn't have had to die saving your life!\"\n\n\"Mommy...\"\n\n\"Murderer!\" The woman screamed out with a violent cackle.\n\nJean stumbled back and fell on her bottom in fear as she saw her mother's accusatory gaze. Her mother's face began darkening rapidly and her body started to desiccate in a similar fashion.\n\nThrough the woman's oscillating mouth, a dark, viscous, bile-like substance started to ooze out, as boils started to pop out in her skin.\n\n\"You're the reason I'm dead, girl! My husband is all alone, because of you! Mother-killer!\" The woman screamed out loud with a frenzied expression.\n\nHer skin and flesh started to dissolve along with the dark ooze, slowly turning her into a malignant blob of muck. The blob began to undulate and change shape, settling into an enlarged form of the woman it used to be.\n\n\"You're a curse! A jinx! A monster!\" It howled in the woman's voice, yet with an additional almost inhuman reverb.\n\nAs Jean processed the events, her eyes widened with overwhelming guilt. Tears started to stream out unceasingly as she began hyperventilating.\n\n\"It's all my fault... It's all my fault... It's all my fault...\" She muttered repeatedly, with a dazed expression.\n\nThe dark form of the woman pointed directly at Jean and declared with a sinister grin, \"When I died, in my last breath, the only feeling I had towards you was hate. I hated you for killing me. I hated you for separating me from the man I loved. And I hated you for being born!\"\n\n\"Now, die!\" The form declared as it swooped down on Jean, consuming her into a suffocating mass of toxic slurry.\n\n____\n\nJean gasped loudly as she woke up from her nightmare. Her forehead was coated with sweat, just like the rest of her body.\n\nShe inhaled and exhaled heavily as she tried to catch her breath.\n\nShe looked around in her bed. Her surroundings were familiar to her. It was an elegant and well-maintained room, indicative of a boudoir of a young lady from a wealthy household. However, there was an additional accommodation in the room for a private workspace, filled with appliances and devices used by alchemists and physicians, such as a small cauldron, a plethora of beakers and tubes, mortar and pestle, acupuncture needles, knives, and so on.\n\nInterestingly, this addition did not seem jarring to the eyes as it blended seamlessly into the remainder of the room. This was assisted by the fact that the boudoir itself did not entertain excess decorations that were common in the bedchambers of the wealthy young misses from other households.\n\nThis room was simple, yet it did not sacrifice its feminine charms in favour of minimalism, nor did it overcompensate by tilting heavily towards a more masculine and rugged ambience. \n\n\"My room,\" Jean confirmed monotonously.\n\nShe then inspected her body thoroughly. She patted her youthful face that was in the process of transforming the soft and immature baby fat into a firmer replacement. She felt her slim arms, which were neither bony as a result of excess starvation or unhealthy eating practices, nor excessively muscular. \n\nShe slid her hands over her chest, housing the still growing mounds that bloomed as she progressed through her adolescence, and then passed over her flat stomach, which accentuated her developing abdominal muscles. She patted her well-proportioned hips and thighs and stopped right before her knees.\n\n\"Still 13 years old, alive,\" she affirmed with an unwavering tone.\n\n#But I'm still dead,# a voice retorted in her mind.\n\nJean knew better now than to entertain the voice with a response. Hence she chose to ignore it and carefully sat up in her bed.\n\n*Did you have a nightmare again, baby?* the same voice asked, but with a warmer tone.\n\n*Did you forget to take the medicine Mage Baruchel prescribed for you again?*\n\n#That man was a hack! She should have poisoned him when she had the chance.#\n\n*We must not hurt others! We're healers. Our job is to treat people.*\n\n#Ha! Her, a healer? Please! She can't even cultivate past the Early stage of Mana Condensation realm. Is she even qualified to call herself a healer?#\n\n*It's your fault that she is unable to cultivate!*\n\n#Oh please! You say that as if I am the only guilty party here. You are equally responsible, oh saintly one!#\n\nJean shook her head, in a vain attempt to quieten the rampant argument occurring within her mind. She released a sigh filled with a mixture of different emotions, yet her face remained unchanged.\n\nThe room she was in maintained a serene silence unlike the cacophony resonating from within the deepest recesses of her mind.\n\nBut the physical silence was disturbed by a series of knocks from her room door.\n\n\"Young Miss, are you awake?\" a soft, aged, female voice followed, speaking with a respectful tone.\n\n\"Come in, Josie,\" Jean answered.\n\nThe room door opened and an elderly maid walked in, with her head facing low.\n\n\"Young Miss, Lord Rasmus is expecting a guest, and would like for you to be present,\" the maid said.\n\nShe immediately followed up with a few points, \"I have prepared your bath and an appropriate outfit. This slave awaits your instructions.\"\n\nJean clicked her tongue and reprimanded the maid, \"Josie! Can you stop acting so formally with me? You've raised me for goodness sake.\"\n\n\"This maid apologises. She will try harder from now on, Young Miss,\" Josie responded without missing a beat.\n\nJean sighed in defeat, and replied, \"I trust your choice. Please help me get ready.\"\n\nThe maid bowed in affirmation and proceeded to assist Jean off of her bed. As she approached the mattress, the maid noticed the dampness soaking the area where Jean was sleeping.\n\n\"May this slave be presumptuous to ask the Young Miss a personal question?\"\n\nJean simply nodded.\n\n\"Did the Young Miss experience another nightmare? Is the medicine from Mage Baruchel ineffective?\"\n\nJean shook her head. \"I've stopped taking it. They are just sleep-inducing potions. I don't want to build an immunity to it through overconsumption.\"\n\n\"But this...\"\n\n\"You don't have to tell Father. If he asks, just say you don't know or something.\"\n\n\"Young Miss, you know that I cannot lie to the Lord.\"\n\n\"You would do it for me, right?\" The girl asked in a coquettish manner, yet and expression barely shifted from uncaring coldness.\n\n\"This may be presumptuous of this slave. But I hope Young Miss knows that Madam would never blame Young Miss for what happened that day. I have been with Madam since the day she entered this household through marriage. She loved the Young Miss oh so dearly - like the world!\"\n\nJean sagged her shoulders in response and nodded in resignation.\n\nAfter she finished taking a bath, Jean sat down in front of her dressing table and observed her reflection in the mirror. The person that stared back had skin as smooth as Jade, polished to perfection.\n\n\"The Young Miss grows to look more like the Madam every day,\" Josie said lovingly as she started to work Jean's hair expertly.\n\n\"A portrait may capture the appearance of a person, but it is seldom able to mimic the person's aura,\" Jean answered.\n\nJean held the ends of her lips and pulled them upwards to mimic a smile. But the moment she lifted her fingers, the corners retreated to her default neutral state.\n\n#You may look like me, but you will never be as good! You are a disgrace to that face. You should cut it with that knife!#\n\nJean glanced at the knife on her workspace, which happened to neighbour her dressing table.\n\n*No! Don't listen to her!*\n\n\"Did father say who the guest was?\" Jean asked casually.\n\n\"To answer the Young Miss, the Lord only revealed that the guest was some teacher from the Radiant Academy,\" Josie answered.\n\n\"Another one? Father should just give up. Magic and cultivation just aren't in my destiny,\" Jean muttered.\n\nJosie quickly responded with a serious tone, \"Young Miss should not disparage herself! This slave firmly believes that the Young Miss will one day soar through the heavens!\"\n\nJean wanted to chuckle in amusement, yet she just couldn't vocalise the emotion.\n\nWith Josie's help, Jean got ready and adorned a simple, yet practical outfit. Nowadays, Jean seldom purchased any clothes that accentuated frivolity. Her mind could not fathom such fleeting emotions anymore. For her, an outfit must conform to its basic tasks, as well as offer practical additions that may come to use at a moment's notice.\n\nFeeling hungry? Worry not, there is a snack bar in the back trouser pockets. Feeling a sneeze approaching? The front pockets hold both a kerchief as well as a few phials of flu medicine. While most young mistresses relegated such mundane tasks to carry-on bags, usually held by their attendants, Jean preferred to tack them onto her person. It was more convenient that way.\n\nJean walked familiarly through the corridors of her home, towards the salon, with Josie following closely behind her.\n\nShe knocked on the door, before entering. Although it was her own home, it was bad manners to enter without indicating intent. Ironically, Jean wasn't waiting for an affirmation from the occupants within. She was only offering a courtesy, not capitulating.\n\nOnce she entered, her eyes swam over the figure of her father and locked on the unfamiliar entity sitting opposite.\n\n\"Jean! Come, I want you to meet Teacher Jo Way!\" Her father said jovially.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-077]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":142,"$":{"0":{"v":"Volume 1 - A Whole New World","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nGuy Larks dies and transmigrates to a new world with magic.\n\n","n":0.302}}},{"i":143,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 075 - Breaking Through to Foundation Establishment","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nInterestingly, Markus and Guy weren't alone in the room. No, this entire time, another pair of eyes, mana sense to be specific, were trained in their direction originating from a quaint little cottage at the base of the steps leading up to the orphanage.\n\nNot once had Krish let down his observation since the arrival of the aberrant party with a fortune as black as the clear night sky. This entire time, he had his eyes on Guy with unwavering obsession.\n\n\"What is your deal?!\"\n\nKrish's characteristically endless patience was wearing thin at a very rapid pace. He was a nail's width away from barging in front of the man, splitting open his head and observing everything that laid within.\n\nThis was until today!\n\nHe was attracted by an explosion from the orphanage. Since it followed a sudden fluctuation of mana, Krish figured that it must have been a spell gone wrong.\n\n\"The boy's probably messing around again,\" he sighed. He had witnessed the chap called Markus trying to flit around with spells. He was tempted to reprimand the boy on his stupidity. Not just anyone could create a new spell. Yet he was repeatedly proven wrong when 80% of the spells the boy put together ended up working. Krish was convinced that the boy was some hidden genius, wasting away his talents in this village.\n\nAfter making sure that the boy was okay, Krish retrained his senses back on Guy, who was rushing towards the orphanage with concern plastered over his face. Krish didn't have a poor opinion of the man's character. Through his observation, he had found that Guy was extremely cordial and personable, especially with kids. He had raised a seemingly illiterate boy into a voracious reader within the span of just a month. This was unprecedented by Krish's standards. Sure, teaching mortal knowledge and magic were two different realms by definition, yet the craft at its base remained the same. A good teacher was to be respected no matter what they specialised in. And Guy for one had entered Krish's books as the paramount definition of one.\n\nKrish observed as the master and disciple cleaned up the room and sat down to discuss the disciple's current quandary. It was a conversation Krish had observed many times in his life. Defeat was always hard to digest, especially when a genius experienced one. As the saying went, \"the bigger you are, the harder you fall!\" Oftentimes, the damage incurred by a rapidly deflated ego was far-reaching and seldom healed.\n\nYet the boy hadn't fretted over it as hard as Krish predicted. Maybe it was due to Guy's tutelage, but Markus was able to accept his loss. His only problem was in trying to find a way to overcome his defeat and grow stronger. That was also understandable. After all, he was unfortunate enough to face a mage with the bloodline of an Abyssal Wyrm. Krish had fought against those dastardly reptiles on a few occasions in his lifetime. It was never an easy fight, even when he was realms above them.\n\nHowever, Guy did not dissuade Markus from pursuing his research into the spell. This shocked Krish! Usually, he would wholeheartedly agree with Guy's teachings. But Krish knew for a fact that unless someone had the inherent quality to mould darkness mana, replicating the spell would be impossible.\n\nIt was at that point that Guy started explaining about an archaic object he called a \"black hole\". Krish would have scoffed and berated Guy like every other mage, if not for the fact that he had read manuscripts explaining a similar phenomenon.\n\nAfter the Age of Isolation, many mages had ventured out of Gaea in search of other realms or planetary bodies with life. A few had found traces, yet none was substantiative. Within the accounts of one such mage, Krish had read of his experience witnessing a faint dark spot in the already dark canvas of outer space. It had an ethereal halo surrounding it, but that was all his senses could gleam. According to the mage's notes, just observing it had sent his instincts blaring in fear. One must note that the mage whose journals Krish read was also in the Tesseract Transformation realm. To scare a powerhouse at the pinnacle, it must have truly been a powerful existence - this \"black hole\".\n\n\"But how does he know of this?\" Krish muttered. In recent years, no one had ventured out of Gaea. Most accounts that emerged in the past had disappeared from the face of this planet. The only explanation to Guy's vast knowledge was the existence of a power backing him. Maybe a teacher with multiple millennia in his pockets, or even an inheritance from a deceased mage. Both were likely possibilities and warranted further digging, but there was time for that.\n\nThe exchange within the room reached a stalemate as Markus was unable to grasp the insight his teacher conveyed to him. Krish sighed in disappointment, yet he wasn't discouraged. Maybe in a few years, the boy would grasp the essence of these insights and assimilate them. Cultivation wasn't like making food. Adding a new ingredient may take effect immediately when creating a sumptuous meal, but insights took time to take root and grow. Only geniuses amongst geniuses could grasp insights the moment they left a teacher's lips.\n\nBut what happened next, once again, threw Krish for a loop. The two in the room entered a kind of fugue state. Their eyes turned blank as the aura permeating from Guy changed drastically. For a moment, Krish saw a burgeoning light within Guy's seemingly void-like fortune. The man also \"felt\" different. There was an overwhelming sense of zealousness permeating from his pores that assaulted Krish's rationality, tempting it to succumb.\n\nAs he scrutinised the scene further, he realised that the two were cultivating. Their mana flow was indicative of that. Krish changed the way he trained his senses to glean more information about their cultivation. At his level, it was possible to grasp information beyond what regular senses could see. Sometimes he could even see abstract concepts. Cultivation happened to be one of them.\n\nHe saw that Markus was at a roadblock in his cultivation, a bottleneck if you will. This was determined based on a myriad of factors bundled into one: mana flow, body conditioning, environmental fluctuations, and so on. It would take a few years for this to pass naturally as the boy organically advanced through assimilating insights. Alternatively, he could ingest some potent potions and smash through the barriers, but that was generally frowned upon at lower levels of cultivation. Since the higher your realm was, the harder it was to break through. So it was unnecessary and detrimental to force breakthroughs at a lower realm when it was supposed to be easier.\n\nRight in front of Krish's eyes, or senses, the bottleneck was being opened smoothly. The boy's rigid mana circulation was smoothening and previous restrictions were being burst through with a torrent of mana. It was an unbelievable occurrence! To do that must have meant that the boy had gained an epiphany of Herculean proportions and that too within minutes of experiencing the bottleneck!\n\nUpon further inspection, Krish noticed that it wasn't just the bottleneck that was being eased away, but the boy's cultivation itself was undergoing a drastic change that usually led to deviations within most mages. Certain active mana pathways were being rerouted or truncated, as though parts of the boy's cultivation were being snipped off by some sort of non-existent pair of scissors. In some locations, new mana channels were being opened up and widened, as if new sections were being glued in. Some channels were getting twisted or elongated, while others shortened or straightened. None of this made any sense! It was beyond Krish's vast realm of comprehension.\n\nAfter calming himself, Krish was able to hypothesise two possible reasons for this. Either the boy's cultivation method was special that allowed for such drastic changes in his core paradigms without incurring massive deviations and internal damage, or Guy was such a potent teacher that he was able to change his student's cultivation at its core without incurring any consequencess. Maybe they were both true!\n\n\"Another string to follow!\" Krish exclaimed with enthusiasm.\n\nAs the metaphorical dust began settling, Krish witnessed another rare occurrence: perfected resonance! Surprisingly, it wasn't just Guy, but his student too! They were both simultaneously undergoing perfected resonance! And through the entire process, they were preoccupied in a fugue state, oblivious to the changes they were undergoing.\n\nAfter a brief minute, Markus started to settle down. His cultivation had formed a solid and unshakeable core and appeared ready to break into the Foundation Establishment realm. Maybe after cultivating a little more, the boy could breakthrough.\n\nHowever, Guy didn't stop. A whirlpool of mana began exhibiting above the orphanage and started to siphon into Guy. The temperature within the room rose drastically as steam began emanating from the man's skin. As gaseous, scalding, mana escaped from his pores, his clothes started to disintegrate, falling into tatters. The pure mana coursing within him started to change state from gaseous to liquid. Like with most physical exothermic state changes, this released a lot of heat. Usually, mages would isolate themselves, submerge in a cool medical bath and proceed completely in the nude to alleviate any possible damages they may incur.\n\nWith an ethereal boom, the man's foundations solidified and the impurities within his blood surged out as steam. Guy had successfully stepped foot into the true path of magehood - he was now within the Base Stage of the Foundation Establishment realm!\n\n____\n\nGuy had put together a \"video\" for Markus by splicing together key bits and pieces from various documentaries such as Neil DeGrasse Tyson's \"Cosmos - A Space Odyssey\" and from fiction works such as \"Interstellar\". Although he hadn't personally witnessed a black hole in its horrific majesty, he believed that these visual mediums were suitable enough to convince Markus. Of what remained, Guy let his passionate self take reign and fill in the gaps.\n\nThrough some religious drivel explaining the power one could wield by comprehending the \"True World\" Guy was able to inculcate the concepts of an unbelievable phenomenon into Markus. As the boy absorbed the information, Guy saw his ethereal form turning more solid. At a point, a string connecting his consciousness and Markus' form in the Church materialised and started to grow thicker.\n\nGuy wasn't sure what this was, and his current state refused to question it even a little. He wanted to let his supreme rationality take over, but the other guy just wouldn't let off! There was still a few sermons to go through apparently...\n\nGuy wasn't having any of it! He quickly assaulted his other self and reigned it in, immediately taking off the mask. After he returned to the RoK, he was greeted by an unbearable heat assaulting him.\n\n\"Oh my goodness, it's hot!\" He quickly retreated from the RoK and reentered his body.\n\nBefore he could take account of what had happened, the door to Markus' room swung open.\n\n\"Markus, it's time for lunch- What the hell is going on in here?!\" Grace exclaimed as she witnessed the completely naked Guy sitting in front of Markus in a lotus position.\n\n\"YOU PERVERT! I knew you were trouble when you walked in! Leave Markus alone!\"\n\nShe cursed with a shrill voice and fetched a convenient stick supported against the room's door frame.\n\n\"Get over here!\" She yelled as she rushed over at Guy with visible rage in her eyes.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-2.chapter-076]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":144,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 074 - I See Dead Stars","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nGuy recognised a key fact during his conversation with Markus. How was it that people back on Earth - regular people without any involvement in scientific research - were able to comprehend and internalise the concept of a black hole and all that entailed? In truth, the idea was so absurd it should not have been so easily registered. The fact that there existed something out there capable of interfering with light, which was universally designated to have the fastest speed, goes against everything learned during the primary, middle, and a large part of the high-school curriculum. Even the definition of the second, according to Système International (SI), is expressed with respect to light!\n\nRegardless of the irrational nature of the phenomenon, in the 21st century, even a little kid could recite what a black hole was as if they were familiar with it. How was that possible?\n\nIt couldn't have been because of the advent of the internet. Free distribution of information couldn't have been the sole cause for such a widespread acknowledgement of such ludicrous thought paradigms. For someone to change the way they think, evidence beyond reasonable doubt was an imminent requirement. Well, that was in most cases. Guy decided to brush off the fact that there was still a sizeable chunk of the population holding the belief that the world was flat.\n\nUltimately, it was the result of the advancement in media and visual presentation that allowed the widespread acclamation of advanced scientific concepts amongst the general populace. To be able to take an abstract concept and package it into a comprehensible visual medium easily accessible by the unindoctrinated masses ensured that even the most outlandish of ideas could be easily digested.\n\nIn fact, even before scientists were able to visually capture an image of a black hole, they were able to create visual representations of the phenomenon using rendering software and digital media incorporating the science backing the assertions. Interestingly, most if not all of these renderings were close to the actual phenomenon. Once the public observed these representations and understood the science behind them, which was conveyed in bite-size chunks, they quickly adopted the idea and acknowledged its presence.\n\nThis was something sorely lacking in Guy's current world. Well, that would be a false generalisation. Guy didn't know much about the state of advanced technology in this world and to an extent, his perspective was clouded by his immediate experiences. With magic, there were endless possibilities, unfortunately, Guy wasn't knowledgeable enough to exploit these benefits to reinforce his teaching methods.\n\n\"But maybe there might be another way,\" Guy mumbled to himself. What he needed to do was convince Markus about the relation between gravitational fields and light. He tried once using the regular method of pedagogy and failed due to its drawbacks in this world. But what if there was another way to get through Markus' barrier of rationality and 'reveal' to him the 'truth of the world'?\n\nThe thought itself sent shudders down Guy's spine. He never even considered that he'd resolve to use 'that' on his students! But he was left without any options. He couldn't afford to let Markus stew on the teachings on his own and hope that the boy achieved a breakthrough sometime in the future.\n\nWith a sigh, Guy retreated into the RoK and approached the mask placed carefully on the desk at the centre.\n\nHe held the mask in both his hands and slowly brought it close to his face. The moment the cold metallic feeling graced his skin, a familiar feeling washed over him. Once again, he could feel his rationality getting isolated from his psyche and condensing into a blob of untainted and cold logic, retreating to the back of his mind. What remained was unrestrained fervour and passion!\n\nAs Guy's consciousness beheld The Church in all its grandiose glory, he was greeted by a novel sight. Upon the previously unending yet empty pews, there sat an ethereal form. Right at the very front, Guy saw the corporeal shape of an entity all too familiar to him: Markus.\n\nThe boy had a ghostlike, translucent appearance as he sat on his seat with a solemn look on his face. His arms were placed carefully on his laps, as they held each other. His gaze was firmly planted towards the ever-changing insignia adorned at the front of the Church as if he were worshipping it wholeheartedly.\n\nGuy's rationality was extremely disgusted by this sight, yet he could do nothing of it since right now it was his passionate side that held the steering wheels. Guy approached the corporeal form of Markus and grasped the boy's entwined hands.\n\nThe moment Guy contacted Markus, the boy's solemn face warped with confusion.\n\n\"Where... Where am I?\" Markus exclaimed as he swivelled his head in place.\n\n\"Worry not, my child. You are safe,\" Guy answered with a warm smile and a welcoming gaze. \n\nThis alleviated some of Markus' concerns. One minute he was sitting in his room, and the next his surroundings began to ripple. He could still feel that he was in his room, yet the atmosphere had a different, very overpowering but soothing aura. His growing fears were quickly doused after he acknowledged that his Master was also present. He chalked off the entire situation as part of one of his Master's magic.\n\n\"I sense great confusion and turmoil within your heart. Why do you fret, child?\" Guy asked.\n\nSuddenly, Markus could feel an overwhelming sense of release boiling from within. He was feeling urged to purge his inner knots in favour of catharsis.\n\n\"I... I want to get stronger! I know that deciphering Gaige's spell is the only way to do it. But I feel so useless! I couldn't do it on my own, nor could I do it after getting your help. I'm such a waste!\" Markus cried in frustration.\n\n\"Now, now! Child, this is not your fault. And I know that no matter what I tell you, it will not dissuade you from your misery. So, let me show it to you!\" Guy declared as he flamboyantly waved his hands, pointing towards the altar before him.\n\nOn queue, the sight began to ripple once again as a dark screen manifested on the altar. It was void black, like the emptiness of space, and looked extremely out of place.\n\n\"What is that?\" Markus said in awe.\n\n\"Watch...\"\n\nSlowly, Markus felt himself getting pulled into the screen. His senses began to tremble as he started to feel disembodied. Suddenly, as if he were in a massive vacuum, he felt himself getting sucked into a vessel. It was extremely disorienting, but after a short moment, he suddenly found that his senses had returned to him.\n\n\"Where am I?\"\n\nAs his eyes scanned his surroundings, he was greeted by a foreign environment. He appeared in a circular room, with a flat ceiling. The walls around him were all transparent as if made of extremely clear and see-through glass. The sights beyond the glass were familiar to him. It reminded him of the night sky, bright and full of stars.\n\n\"Am I in space?\"\n\nMarkus knew that word. What lay beyond the confines of the planet he lived in, Gaea. Space was always a compelling prospect for Markus. Ever since he learned that there could be worlds just like his into the night sky, he was immediately enamoured.\n\n\"So this is what it looks like,\" Markus commented in awe.\n\nBut then, from the corner of his eyes, he observed a strange object.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\nAs if answering his question, the room he was currently in began to propel itself towards the direction of that object. He was getting closer, and closer.\n\nIt looked odd, to say the least. Space in and of itself looked like an empty, dark void. But this object was much, much darker. It was so dark that it made outer space look as bright as the sun. Markus was sure he'd have missed it if not for the circle halo of light enveloping it in a thin blanket. It marked a visible boundary to distinguish the object from its surroundings.\n\nIt had a circular appearance. Markus was confused whether it was spherical because at its 'poles' were two bright pillars that appeared to be spinning. The axis of rotation implied that the body was spherical, yet it was so dark that Markus couldn't decipher its third dimension.\n\n\"This...\"\n\nTo Markus, the mass appeared small. He didn't know whether it was because he was far away from it, or if it was actually that size. But as he approached it, it started to become larger. Enormous even!\n\nUpon reaching closer, Markus was able to observe the mass with greater detail. The area around the black mass began to visibly warp. What should have appeared stationary and point-like, stretched out like a noodle and began to revolve with a high angular velocity. There was no sound, but Markus felt the undulating seismic activity passing through him periodically.\n\nAnd suddenly, he was caught!\n\n\"This feeling...\" It was all too familiar. To date, he was haunted by it in his sleep. But unlike in his fight, it didn't stop or plateau.\n\nAs Markus approached the object, which he now recognised as a black hole, he began to experience a crushing feeling well beyond what he had ever felt in his entire life. It grew exponentially with each passing millisecond.\n\n\"ARGH!\" His body screamed, yet he knew that it was intact. This pain was completely phantom in nature, yet extremely life-like.\n\nThe room Markus was in approached the now-massive black hole. He was so close that the area around him began to fold in on itself. He was in a total and complete abyss. He couldn't feel anything else apart from an immense pressure a hundred trillion times his weight, attacking each and every single atom in his body.\n\n\"This is true darkness!\" Markus declared while gritting his teeth. Gaige's spell was nothing! It was barely the tip of the iceberg. This was true power. Unadulterated and unforgiving. Gaige could only dream to touch the surface of what Markus was experiencing right now.\n\nAnd then there was nothing.\n\nComplete darkness.\n\nAll Markus could remember was his body getting ripped apart piece by piece, molecule by molecule, atom by atom. And it didn't stop at that!\n\nYet it all occurred within an infinitesimal fraction of a second. So fast that the pain barely managed to register in his mind.\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nMarkus once again experienced the feeling of entering a vacuum. His suspended body was whisked out, and he found himself back to where he was before, facing a dark screen next to his Master.\n\n\"It was the same! Darkness... I now know what it is!\" Markus uttered with excitement while facing his Master's pious gaze.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-075]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":145,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 073 - Paradigm Shift","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nIt was hard for Markus to come to terms with his loss at the Apprentice Tournament. He had persisted till the end, yet all it took was one spell to turn the tides. The experience was etched into Markus' heart like a troublesome scar. Not just the disappointment from the loss, but the pain that built up to the defeat.\n\n\"It felt like an immense force was bearing down on me. But the weird thing was that it was distributed, not concentrated. Each and every single fibre of my being was experiencing the pressure all at once!\" Markus recounted ponderously.\n\n* \"It was the strongest spell I have ever seen or experienced...\"\n\nGuy nodded morosely and commented, \"I'm sorry that you had to go through that. I cannot imagine how much pain you were under.\"\n\nMarkus immediately shook his head and added, \"No, Master! You shouldn't apologise! It was my decision to participate. I could have very easily turned it down.\"\n\nHe sighed and continued, \"As you've told me many times. That fight, and my loss, was an inevitability. While I cannot readily agree with that sentiment, I respect your perspective and understand the underlying implication of what you're trying to convey. However, accepting my loss does not negate it from history.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Guy answered.\n\n\"With that in mind, I've been reevaluating the match in search of areas for improvement. If I were to confront my opponent once again, how can I achieve a victory?\" Markus declared.\n\n\"But, no matter what, I end up with the same conclusion: there is just no way! And that is BECAUSE of the spell Gaige cast at the end.\" As he finished the sentence, Markus' shoulders drooped in defeat.\n\nTaking the hint, Guy continued in Markus' place, \"So, you've been exploring different avenues to learn the spell?\"\n\n\"That was my initial intention. Through research, I was able to posit that the spell could have been in some ways connected to a special bloodline or physique. It could have also been a spell passed down within his clan. I also couldn't write off the possibility that it was taught to him through some fortuitous encounter, maybe by his teacher even - Teacher Way,\" Markus explained.\n\n\"Those routes were obviously dead-ends. Even if I knew the source of the spell, there wasn't anything I could do to obtain it. Which meant that I was only left with another option: to use my existing knowledge to create the spell.\"\n\n\"Understandable,\" Guy commented.\n\n\"I then started with a mind-map of what I knew already that could be connected to the spell, and details that were unknown and required additional digging,\" Markus said as he retrieved a wooden board hidden behind his dress cupboard. On it, he had etched an elaborate map detailing his different hypotheses and findings as well as his arguments and counter-arguments to various theories he'd learned along the way.\n\n\"Through some investigation, I was able to determine that the spell was categorised under the darkness element,\" Markus commented, to which Guy interjected with a question, \"How do you know that it was affiliated with the darkness element?\"\n\n\"Right! Soothsayer Nara told me. I wasn't able to find any publications, but he happened to have some experience dealing with spells categorised under the darkness element, and those details aligned with my experiences as well. So I deduced that they were the one and the same,\" Markus answered.\n\n'It's him again!' Guy noted down the occurrence of such a convenient coincidence in his mind. He would pursue this line of questioning at a later date.\n\n\"As I was saying, the name 'darkness' implied that the spell might have some connection with light, given how the absence of light is the definition of darkness. After some contemplation, it made sense to me. Moreover, given how light is also a form of energy, and since the effect of the spell could be categorised as non-contact, the conclusion seemed valid.\"\n\n\"However, this brought up the question, how can you qualitatively define the opposite of light, that is darkness, as an energy?\"\n\nGuy interrupted Markus with a question, \"What makes you think that the so-called 'darkness' element is the opposite of the 'light' element?\"\n\nMarkus tilted his head and answered, \"Isn't it a logical conclusion? I mean, the opposite of the standard fire element is water. To counter lightning, you use earth. To counter water, lightning, and so on...\"\n\n\"That's the old way of thinking, isn't it? But we know for a fact that the world doesn't work that way,\" Guy clarified.\n\nMarkus exhaled loudly and spoke with some irritation, \"I get that, I do. But the way you taught me hasn't led me to any worthwhile discoveries-\"\n\n\"Then, has the old method worked out? Looking at the state of your room, I would say that it hasn't,\" Guy interrupted.\n\nMarkus stewed in silence with his head hung low. He curled his palm into a fist as a long-suppressed rage threatened to spill over. He wasn't angry at his Master. No, his grievance was solely directed towards himself. This was all he could amount to, and it pained him to accept that fact. Life was never fair, if it were then there would be no sorrow in this world. Even though he'd managed to catch up to his peers in the marathon called life, he could see that while others would persist till the end, he was doomed to drop off midway.\n\n\"Actually, the problem isn't that there is no way to define the element known as 'darkness' through scientific reasoning, it's that you aren't able to conceptualise the phenomenon given your current thought paradigm,\" Guy pointed out, interjecting Markus' detractive thoughts.\n\n\"Honestly, it isn't even your fault. The idea in and of itself is so hard to fathom that someone without the proper background or knowledge cannot conceptualise it organically,\" Guy elaborated.\n\nFacing Markus' confounded expression Guy wore a mysterious smile. \"Let's start from the first thing you said. 'It felt like an immense force was bearing down on me'. What can you derive from that statement?\"\n\nMarkus nodded in contemplation and began voicing his thoughts, \"Force bearing down... are you implying that the spell had something to do with exerting a force?\"\n\n\"You then added, 'the weird thing was that it was distributed, not concentrated'. What does that tell you?\"\n\n\"Distributed force... But I know that it was contactless... So it was a field of some sort?\" Markus asked.\n\n\"Let's bring it all together,\" Guy instructed.\n\n\"A force field. Since it wasn't specifically targetting metallic objects, nor was it acting on charges, I can rule out both magnetic and electric fields. So the only thing that remains is gravity?\"\n\nGuy nodded with a beaming smile, \"Bingo!\"\n\n\"But that doesn't make any sense! I've already entertained that theory before, but it yielded nothing. For instance, how can gravity interface with light?\" Markus challenged\n\n\"And that's where the problem starts. Your thought paradigm is limited by what you know. But consider the following case: A supermassive star is nearing the end of its life. At its demise, it undergoes an enormous explosion of cosmic proportion, propelling plasma and matter into space haphazardly. But what of the mass that remains? The star was so massive during its main sequence that the remaining mass is far denser than what could have been imagined. Without thermonuclear pressure to oppose the rapidly increasing gravitational forces, the mass collapses in on itself. It compresses so much that it literally bores into the fabric of space-time, creating a region where the gravity is so strong, that nothing can escape it.\"\n\nAs Guy finished and cleared his throat to diminish the after-effects of using his teaching voice, he was met with Markus' awestruck gaze.\n\n\"What is this thing called, Master?\"\n\n\"A black hole!\" Guy answered matter of factly, to which Markus narrowed his eyes.\n\n\"That's a very straightforward name...\" He muttered. But then he quickly shook his head and continued, \"But I still don't understand, Master. How can gravity, something that is known to act on masses, affect light which is a form of energy?\"\n\nGuy sighed as he answered, \"That's because light has a dual nature. It is a form of energy AND has a material form, known as a photon.\"\n\n\"What? How does that even work?!\" Markus exclaimed in disbelief.\n\n\"If you can suspend your scepticism just a little bit and entertain the thought that light can exhibit material properties, then we can actually derive a simple formula to describe a theoretical radius a cosmic body needs to have, given its mass, so that it can be defined as a black hole.\" Guy enthusiastically picked up a handy chalkboard in Markus' room and began writing on it.\n\n\"Let us start by equating kinetic energy of a mass and kinetic energy due to gravity:\"\n\n1/2 mv^2 = GMm/r\n\n\"Let us evaluate kinetic energy of a mass on the left-hand side as applying to light, which through its duality can be defined as photon particles. We use 'c' to define the speed of light, and since a photon is essentially massless we can cancel out 'm' on both sides:\"\n\n1/2 c^2 = GM/r\n\n\"Rearranging this formula yields:\"\n\nr = 2GM/c^2\n\n\"As you can see. Given a cosmic body with mass M, in order for it to classify as a black hole, it needs to have a radius defined by this formula. This is called the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole. And as seen here, it is defined by the fact that a black hole is able to capture light! Isn't this fascinating?\"\n\nMarkus nodded, then shook his head, \"I understand what you're trying to explain here, but I can't get my head around this idea...\"\n\nGuy grimaced and replied, \"To truly grasp the implications of this theory, you either need to be inducted into the field of general relativity or need to see a black hole. I think you should have experienced something similar to it, albeit only an infinitesimal fraction of a true black hole, through Gaige's ultimate spell.\"\n\nAnd with that, the duo entered a state of complete silence.\n\nMarkus was totally stumped by everything his Master revealed to him in the past few minutes. While he trusted his Master wholeheartedly and believed everything he had taught him, this was the first time Markus was unable to internalise and assimilate his Master's teachings. It wasn't that he thought his Master was lying to him, just that the entire concept sounded so ludicrous his mind just wasn't willing to accept it.\n\nMaybe Guy understood these sentiments in Markus' blank gaze, because he followed up with a thoughtful revelation, \"The scientific process is full of such paradigm shifts. Sometimes, you end up in a dead-end where the only way to get out is by looking at the problem from a different, sometimes revolutionary perspective. The many truths of this world are seldom straightforward.\"\n\nYet this still could not alleviate Markus' current struggle. Right as Guy was about to call it a day and urge Markus to take some time to absorb what he had learned, an unconventional thought struck him.\n\n'Truth of the world... Maybe...'\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-074]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":146,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 072 - Do Not Try This at Home","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\nIt was a day like any other for Grace. She woke up early, as usual. Prepared a meal for Markus, Dora and Kano, as usual. Tended to the herb gardens near the woods, as usual. Everything was as it had always been!\n\nOr that was at least what she kept telling herself. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't overlook the very visible man who sat opposite her at the meal table. Nor could she overlook the new din that persisted near the orphanage when kids from the village came over for their schooling.\n\n\"That man's trouble!\" She would mutter intermittently, in a vain attempt to brainwash herself.\n\nShe was constantly wary of the man's presence. He was just like one of them, after all. She kept waiting for something to go wrong, a reason for her to take action. Her subconscious would constantly urge her to waste him where he slept, to avoid any unwanted surprises. But her conscience would always say otherwise.\n\nBecause no matter how much she distrusted his kind, his being here had definitely netted some positives. Nowadays, whenever she spoke with Markus, the boy would constantly go on and on about things his \"Master\" had taught him. Not just magic, but insights into life. It wasn't all fruity and self-righteous, it was actually practical and applicable. Most of the time Grace found herself agreeing along. And truthfully, Markus was also more upbeat and personable, except for when he locked himself in his room. Who knew what he did in there? Grace, for one, did not want to find out what a boy nearing puberty was up to behind closed doors!\n\nAnd then there was Kano. That introverted and closed off chap, who Grace feared would remain in her care till his adulthood, was also slowly coming out of his shell. There was no longer a dense, dark cloud hanging over him. It was now replaced with a bright sun that only paled in comparison to the smile the boy would intermittently flash her way.\n\nSometimes, Grace wondered if that man cast some illusionary spell to hypnotise them over to his side.\n\n\"He's just too... effective,\" she sighed as she strode out from the herb garden, back to the orphanage. On her way, she happened to stumble across Kano, who was excitedly running towards the steps leading into the village, with an interesting model in his hands.\n\n\"Kano! Be careful, or else you'll trip and break your head!\" She exclaimed.\n\nKano stopped in his track and followed the voice. The moment he noticed Grace, he smiled and greeted her, \"Hi, Matron Reva!\"\n\n\"Where are you going in such a hurry? And what's that in your hands?\" She asked while nudging her head.\n\n\"I'm going to the village to meet D-D-Durkas. And this is a clay model of his finch, I wanted to g-g-gift it to him,\" Kano said as he presented his handiwork.\n\nGrace was immediately taken by the exquisite craftsmanship of the palm-sized clay model in Kano's hands. It was so lifelike that, if not for the lack of colour, Grace was prepared to grab it before it flew away. Grace always knew that Kano had some talent in art and craftsmanship, but she didn't know the exact extent of his prowess until she saw the model. To be able to achieve such accuracy and precision, on a model that was almost to scale and at such a young age...\n\n\"It looks beautiful!\" Grace exclaimed. But then she furrowed her brows and inquired, \"Why are you making this for that boy? Did he bully you again?\"\n\nGrace was preparing herself to march over to that Durkas boy's household and raise a ruckus, but Kano quickly shook his head and stopped her. \"No, no! He didn't bully me. I'm making this on m-m-my own volition.\"\n\n\"Volition?\" Grace asked in surprise.\n\n\"By my own choice,\" Kano explained.\n\n\"No, I know what it means. But how do you know such a big word?\" She said with an impressed tone.\n\n\"I read it in a b-b-book!\" He answered with a proud expression, begging for praise.\n\n\"You read it in a book?!\" Grace asked in shock. But then she quickly wiped the doubt from her face and tone, and followed up with sincere praise, \"Good job!\"\n\nGrace immediately diverted the conversation back to the model, \"You still didn't tell me why you made this?\"\n\n\"D-D-Durkas' finch took flight today and flew into the woods. He was p-p-pretty sad about it. I wanted to make this to cheer him up!\"\n\n\"But why? Wasn't he always bullying you?\"\n\nKano shrugged his shoulders and answered, \"He used to. N-N-Not anymore. He apologised. And T-T-Teacher Larks always says that I need to t-t-treat people the way I want to b-b-be treated back!\"\n\n'Not Kano too!' Grace lamented upon hearing Kano's final sentence. She was already struggling with hearing that man's name and praises from Markus, now she had to hear it from Kano's mouth as wll?\n\nWhile Grace was grovelling internally, Kano decided to leave. By the time Grace came back to herself, he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nShe sighed loudly and with a bitter smile, said, \"Now it's just the girls left...\"\n\nRight as she was about to enter the storage room in the orphanage, an audible blast reverberated from within causing her to nearly drop her basket filled with herbs.\n\n\"What the heck was that?!\" She exclaimed.\n\nShe hurriedly placed the basket on the ground and rushed over to the source of the sound. It wasn't hard to find, because the moment she entered the orphanage, she saw Markus laying and groaning on the unhinged door from his room, while covered in dark soot.\n\n\"Markus! Are you okay?!\" Grace shouted as she rushed over. The boy rolled off the door and coughed loudly, \"I'm okay... I'm *cough* okay...\"\n\n\"What the hell happened?\" She asked, but she knew immediately that magic was involved.\n\nOnce she made sure that Markus was physically fine, she struck the boy's shoulder and reprimanded him, \"What the heck were you doing?\"\n\nWithout waiting for Markus' explanations, Grace continued, \"Are you trying to kill yourself? Because I can do it for you! It won't be as loud and won't damage the damn house either. What were you thinking? Where is that man?!\"\n\nShe grunted in displeasure while swivelling her head in search of Guy.\n\n\"Guy! GUY!\"\n\n\"I'm here!\" Guy panted as he rushed into the room. \"I heard an explosion?!\"\n\n\"Yeah! Your dear student nearly blew up the entire house doing god knows what!\" Grace berated sarcastically.\n\nGuy looked incisively at Markus, who lowered his head while wincing in pain. He then sighed and interrupted Grace before she entered a long tirade, \"I'll fix it. And I'll talk to him.\"\n\nGrace harrumphed and left in a huff to retrieve her basket, leaving Guy and Markus alone.\n\n\"How are you feeling? Are you hurt?\" Guy inquired concernedly.\n\n\"I'm okay,\" Markus assured him.\n\n\"Let's get all of this fixed. Tell me what happened after,\" Guy instructed while bending down to pick up the fallen door.\n\nThe two worked synchronously and started to clean up the damages. Within the hour, they were able to return the house back to its initial condition. Thankfully, the explosion wasn't too large and hadn't damaged the house in its foundations. Furthermore, the house itself was pretty solid and managed to disperse a large portion of the impact, which was surprising.\n\nGuy then followed Markus into his room, and the two sat down facing each other.\n\n\"Explain,\" Guy said.\n\nMarkus scratched his elbows in embarrassment and confessed, \"I was trying to replicate a spell, but the modular combinations weren't quite right.\"\n\nGuy furrowed his brows and inquired further, \"Which spell were you trying to replicate?\"\n\nMarkus grit his teeth and maintained silence.\n\n\"What's wrong? You can tell me,\" Guy coaxed.\n\n\"I was trying to replicate that spell Gaige cast during our fight,\" Markus said in defeat. The moment he finished, his entire aura unwound itself as if a large boulder was being lifted off of his chest. Ever since he'd returned to the orphanage, Markus had been tirelessly researching in an attempt to crack the secrets of that devastating spell he'd suffered through, near the end of his match against Gaige.\n\nBut he knew that he could only pursue this in secret because he couldn't let his Master find out. Master Larks had told him many times that the loss wasn't his fault, but Markus wasn't willing to accept that. Yet there was nothing he could do to change the fact that he lost that match. All he could do was to prepare for the future like his Master kept telling him.\n\nHowever, at every turn, Markus was brought back to his terrible defeat and was forced to live through the horrific spell that nearly crushed him to death.\n\n\"Just what was that magic?\" Markus asked Guy bluntly.\n\nGuy tilted his head, and smiled mysteriously, \"First, I want you to tell me your thoughts. You were obviously researching into it. Tell me what you found out?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-073]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":147,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 071 - Making Friends","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nThe moment Durkas uttered those derogatory words, the atmosphere turned cold. The boy noticed Guy's incisive gaze and shrunk his neck timidly.\n\n\"Why did you call Kano an idiot, Durkas?\" Guy enunciated clearly. \n\nIn response, the boy squirmed in place and muttered in a low voice, \"It's because... because he can't read.\"\n\nGuy nodded contemplatively and retorted, \"I know that your grandmother doesn't know how to read. Would you call her an idiot too?\"\n\nDurkas vehemently shook his head and said, \"No!\"\n\n\"Then?\" Guy shot back.\n\n\"Well... everyone his age in this village can read, but he still struggles with it,\" Durkas reasoned.\n\nGuy once again nodded in agreement, but diverted the discussion, \"I heard from your parents that you're raising a little finch. Is that true?\"\n\nDurkas' eyes opened up with excitement and he nodded with a smile.\n\n\"Apparently, that baby finch of yours failed to make it out of its nest when its mother pushed it off, is that right?\"\n\nOnce Durkas affirmed the supposition, Guy immediately followed up, \"I guess that bird's an idiot, right?\"\n\nDurkas immediately flared with indignation and exclaimed, \"No she's not-\"\n\nBut before Durkas could explain himself, Guy added, \"But all the other finches her age can already fly successfully. She still struggles, shouldn't that mean that she's an idiot too?\"\n\nDurkas was left speechless. He had become trapped within his own reasoning. Being a child, he wasn't well versed in the art of debate like Guy. In fact, his opinions on Kano weren't borne from his own mind, they were a result of his environment. Kids are naturally impressionable. It is inherent biological programming ingrained into the DNA of primate offsprings - \"monkey see, monkey do\".\n\nKids become the way they are by observing the adults in their environment. A child doesn't know what is good or bad, they are essentially born a clean slate. This slate is gradually filled with the information the child sees in its surroundings. Some parts get rewritten, while others get added upon until they reach their teen years, at which point all the markings on the slate become permanent.\n\nThis begged the obvious question, are all humans born good, and is it their environment that turns them evil. To that, Guy would ask what is good and what is evil? Some acts can be readily dumped into the evil category, such as murder and maiming. Others can be just as easily dumped into the good category, such as helping those in need and treating others respectfully. But a large portion isn't so easily categorised.\n\nSome believe that being selfish is evil. But Guy wouldn't agree so readily! Selfishness is essential for survival. For instance, when travelling in aeroplanes, the safety instructions reinforce the fact that during times of depressurisation one must first secure their own oxygen mask before helping those around them. Sure, others would praise you were you to act selflessly and go around helping others before yourself, but what are the chances that you would be alive to receive that praise? What use are goodwill and admiration if you're dead?\n\nBack to the point about a human's nature at birth, the reason why humans are even able to categorise acts into good and evil is that they are born with a conscience - a voice at the back of their mind that judges their every move. But what if a child was born without the capacity to judge their own actions? What would good and evil mean to them?\n\nConsidering these anomalies, Guy established early in his career that it was imperative to inculcate a strong sense of morality in his students from an early age. To those with the ability to moderate their actions, these moral grounds would bolster their growth and turn them into stable adults, given other conditions remain the same. For those without the ability to moderate their actions, these moral grounds would help them evaluate their actions symbolically, through association.\n\nDurkas wasn't a heartless lad, he was only misinformed. The fact that he was willing to take care of a fallen bird was evidence of that matter. Thus, Guy introduced an equation through deductive reasoning in the boy's mind.\n\n\"The finch you're taking care of is just slower than others. She is destined to fly, like her brothers and sisters. However, it just isn't her time yet,\" Guy said.\n\nDurkas thought about it for a while and nodded approvingly.\n\n\"Everybody has their own pace. Life isn't a race, it's a marathon-\"\n\n\"What's a marathon, teacher?\" A girl in the group interrupted while simultaneously raising her hand.\n\n\"Umm, it's like a regular race, except the goal, is to run the entire distance,\" Guy clarified.\n\n\"What's the point of that?\" The girl asked again while simultaneously darting her hand upwards.\n\n\"It's to test your endurance and conviction.\"\n\nThe entire group hummed together in acknowledgement. Guy coughed to draw their attention and resumed, \"As I was saying. Life isn't a race, it is a marathon. Some people get a quick sprint early to rush ahead of the group, others are slower and jog at a measured pace. But all that matters, in the end, is who actually crosses the finish line,\" Guy concluded as he looked directly at the Durkas.\n\nGuy smiled as he observed the expressions on the child's faces. He saw an apologetic and uncomfortable expression wash over, as the boy looked at Kano.\n\nWith a low mutter, Durkas spoke, \"I... I'm sorry for calling you an idiot... Do you want to partner up?\"\n\nGuy nudged Kano forward. Kano looked back and saw Guy push his chin out encouragingly. Although he was a little apprehensive, Kano decided to believe his teacher and said, \"Sure.\"\n\nAnd with that established, the group moved on with the game. Guy settled the excited children and explained the rules.\n\n\"As you can see, I've written ordered numbers on the stairs leading to the orphanage. Right at the midpoint is number 0, and as you go higher, you will see positive numbers, and lower are the negative numbers. In this container in my hands -\" he said while shaking a wooden container with a lid, \"are numbers ranging from -20 up to +20. One member from each group has to dip in and pick up five cards, and line them up face-down in the order they are picked. The picker must then open the first card. Your partner then must go up to that step and await further instructions. Once everyone is on their steps, I will say start and then the picker can open up the remaining cards. Then, your job is to scream out the numbers, and your partner must rise or descend depending on what the number on the card says. So if you read -7, then your partner must go down by 7 steps. Alternatively, you can call out all the numbers and your partner can directly run the calculations and move to the step that corresponds to the total sum. Once your partner settles on the final steps, you need to scream out the sum of all the numbers in your stack. If your answer matches the step your partner is on, then you win a point. If there is a mismatch, then you lose.\"\n\nThe kids nodded their heads as they listened to Guy's explanation, and excitedly dispersed.\n\n\"Kano listen... Why don't you be the one who walks up and down the steps? I'll play as the picker, because... you know?\" Durkas explained to his teammate.\n\nKano sighed half-heartedly. He was really looking forward to peacock his newfound reading prowess. Guy had his ears trained in their direction and heard this exchange. So he decided to add another detail at the last minute, \"Oh, almost forgot! We will be switching roles after every two rounds. It would only be fair that way, otherwise, it's going to be just one person running up and down, tiring themselves.\"\n\nDurkas exhaled loudly and dropped his shoulders.\n\nAnd just like that, the game began. Durkas walked up and grabbed five cards and laid them on the floor in a line. He opened the first, to reveal \"+4\". Just as he was about to shout out the number, he saw Kano rushing up the steps and standing on the step marked \"+4\".\n\nWhen everyone was ready, the pickers all flipped their cards and shouted off their numbers. Thankfully, the steps were wide enough to accommodate multiple children moving around side-by-side.\n\nDurkas was dismayed as he beheld his selections, '-11,+8,-10,+15'. It was unfortunate as it would require Kano to move up and down by a lot. As Kano observed Durkas's expression he said, \"Say out all the numbers at once!\" To which Durkas complied.\n\nWhile the other kids started to follow the numbers sequentially and navigated the steps, Kano was swifter and more efficient. He moved directly to the step which was the total sum, 6 as if he were a robot receiving programmed instructions. While others were panting, Kano barely broke a sweat.\n\nKano superiority in this game was for two main reasons. First, as a resident of the orphanage, he had to regularly move up and down the steps. This repetition had unwittingly raised his stamina and endurance. On top of that, Kano would often play a game of counting the steps while moving around. He had done that so many times, it turned into a subconscious calculation that occurred at the back of his mind. This meant that the abstract idea of addition was easily emulated into a physical operation - climbing stairs. This made sense to Kano, thus raising his efficiency and accuracy in calculating the sum.\n\nDurkas was sceptical about Kano's confidence and began calculating the sum in his head. He raised and lowered his fingers until after half a minute, he screamed \"+6!\". To his shock, Kano screamed the same number.\n\n\"Yaay! We won!\" Durkas exclaimed and hopped around excitedly. \"You're so good at this, Kano!\" He added, causing the recipient to blush.\n\nGuy grinned as he observed this. Although it was too soon to celebrate, Guy was confident that things would turn out for the better following this game.\n\nWhen it was Kano's turn to pick cards, he was not as efficient in his calculations. However, neither was Durkas. So while the boy moved up and down the steps, Kano had plenty of time to determine the final sum.\n\nAs the day ended, Durkas bid Kano farewell, leaving the once timid boy with a smile so bright it could blind the sun.\n\n\"Let's go, Kano!\" Guy said.\n\n\"Yes, Teacher!\" Kano replied and skipped up the steps with a jovial spring.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-072]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":148,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 070 - Another Training Montage","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nGuy never held any wild expectations when he began training Kano. He didn't believe that the boy would just magically become a proficient academic or a literati after a day of work. It was a gradual and strenuous process, and Guy had learned that it was important to maintain a measured approach. In a lot of ways, the success of the training depended heavily on the student's enthusiasm and level of involvement.\n\nIt was often the case that children would just give up after a few sessions after experiencing the difficulty. And for children with dyslexia, the difficulty was significantly amplified. So it was equally important for the teacher to motivate the students to grind through the difficult early stages.\n\nThankfully, with Kano, Guy hadn't yet seen any signs of the boy's motivation diminishing. In fact, after the kid successfully read through the first children's book - spending the whole day on it - his excitement rose to another level! Guy wanted to keep the momentum rolling forward and readily provided the kid with another book. After all, his RoK was filled with these illustrated books catering to pre-schoolers and kindergarteners that would be originally slated to never see the light of day.\n\nHowever, Guy recognised that simply acquiescing to the child's whim would result in the motivation fizzling out early. To refer to the principles of impulse, in order to reduce the damage inflicted by a sudden change in momentum, it is best to elongate the duration over which the change takes place.\n\nThus, Guy didn't miss the opportunity to foist Kano with an assignment that most middle-schoolers and high-schoolers found annoying - writing book reports. Of course, Guy wouldn't expect Kano to write pages worth of insightful commentary on a book that barely contained two hundred words. On top of that, Guy knew better than anyone how easily having to write a report on a piece of literature can suck the excitement from the process. Yet, Kano's willingness to persist without the need for Guy's involvement offered an opportunity!\n\nLanguage is a medium to transmit information and knowledge. To do that, people are generally faced with two possible methods: Text and Speech. Of course, in Modern Earth, knowledge has a multitude of media to facilitate its transmission, yet they can also be boiled down to the aforementioned categories. We can further divide these two categories by how the information is expressed, and how it is received. \n\nKano did not face much difficulty in expressing himself through speech. Barring his stutter, Kano didn't struggle with speaking his thoughts or comprehending others. His problems lied with texts. While practising reading different literature could slowly alleviate this difficulty, Guy determined that it would be more efficient if he could also address the issue of writing in parallel.\n\nTherefore, for the next book, Guy provided Kano with an additional sheet of paper, with a few questions written on it.\n\n\"After you finish reading this book. I want you to write answers to these questions about the book,\" Guy said.\n\nKano's smile quickly diminished as he grasped the piece of paper.\n\n\"I've drawn lines on the page to indicate how large I want your font to be. I have hung up the additional letter's you moulded, with lines indicating how they need to be drawn, in the classroom. You should write while referring to them for now,\" Guy added. Through his past experience, Guy found that using four-lined notes worked best in training kids on how to write. The central two lines defined the general size of the letters, while the line above and below them indicated how high or low the letters could reach. Although Guy had to tweak the distances between lines to meet the requirements of the common language in this world, the general principles still carried over.\n\n\"I know it will be hard at first. But if you read the questions, you will see that their answers require at most two sentences. It's okay if you make mistakes. If we don't fail, we can never improve!\" Guy said as an encouragement.\n\nKano nodded with a serious expression, took the book, and began reading it. Guy observed as the kid followed the method he taught, by following the word being read with his fingers and sounding the letters out loud.\n\n\"The... buh-ih-guh... big- The big, buh-ah-duh, bad- The big bad woh-oo-luh-fuh, wooluhfuh... wooluf? Ah, wolf! The big, bad wolf!\" Kano muttered along.\n\nGuy smiled endearingly as he observed Kano. Surprisingly, the kid turned out to be a voracious reader. Even though attaching the additional task stifled his pace, Kano did not let out his enthusiasm. At first, it would take him two days to finish the book and answer the questions. Within a week, it was reduced to just a day and a half with a clear reduction in errors and spelling mistakes. Within another week, Kano reduced the duration to just a day. By this time, Guy increased the difficulty of his questions, warranting longer answers.\n\nGradually, Kano's reading level began rising. Within a month, Kano managed to raise his proficiency to a first-grade level. His writing had improved as well! He wasn't fast, but his spelling and grammatic accuracy had risen to a stable 70%, which was much higher than Guy expected to achieve within the time frame.\n\n\"Maybe the kid's some kind of a hidden genius?\" Guy said to himself as he finished drawing the final number on the steps leading up to the orphanage, using white chalk.\n\nAlthough Kano's literary skills were catching up to his peers, he was still behind in other fields. Especially arithmetics. While most of the villagers had menial jobs, having a good grasp of basic arithmetics was a dire necessity. It was the only way these folk could avoid getting cheated off of their rightful earnings following their sales.\n\nMost of the kids in the village had a basic grasp on the subject, however, Kano was still behind. Guy felt that it was about time to bring the boy up to speed. Yet, Guy realised that this could also act as an opportunity to accomplish something that was gravely lacking in Kano's life - companionship.\n\nSure, Kano had his twin sister, Markus, Grace, and the elder sister Marie, however, that was not enough. Kano's biggest problem was his self-consciousness. His feeling of inadequacy, borne of the bullying from his peers, was a constant thorn in his psyche. And as long as that thorn remained in his heart, Kano would never be able to advance beyond a certain point. Guy also posited that the kid's stuttering could also be reduced by improving his interpersonal relationships.\n\nAs an adult, Guy couldn't force kids to become friends. Yet, he could nudge them in that direction. Social dynamics in children was generally easier to manoeuvre around. Teenagers, though... that was a whole other ball game. Those hormone-fueled monsters were the worst!\n\nGuy chuckled as he straightened his back and sighed in relief. The preparation for the upcoming task was painstaking. He had to wake up early in the morning and begin counting the number of steps leading to the orphanage. After that, he had to individually write numbers, in order, from the bottom all the way to the top, all the while walking hunched.\n\nRight as he finished, he heard Kano coming down the steps with an exciting spring.\n\n\"T-T-Teacher Larks,\" the boy called out. \"I've finished the b-b-book, and answered the questions,\" he said as he handed a book and a filled-in sheet of paper to Guy.\n\n\"Good job! You finished early?\"\n\nKano smiled wryly and answered, \"I read through the night.\"\n\nGuy frowned and warned Kano, \"I've told you many times not to do that! It will ruin your eyes.\"\n\nKano bit his tongue apologetically, \"I'm sorry. It's just, the s-s-story was very compelling.\"\n\nGuy sighed, \"Forget it! I'm not going to keep telling you this anymore. If not for your own good, at least think about your sister. She's complaining around that you aren't letting her sleep with all the loud mumbling as you read!\"\n\nKano scratched his head in embarrassment. Just as he was about to reply, he heard the voice of a few children approaching them.\n\n\"Teacher Larks, you called us here today?\" A jovial and outgoing boy, around Kano's age, shouted out while jogging. Behind him, there was a small crowd of children around the same age.\n\n\"Durkas! Good, you brought everyone. Alright, class, settle down,\" Guy said with a stern tone. Unfortunately, his voice was drowned out by the chatter amongst the children. Guy wore a serious expression and clapped his hands in succession.\n\nCLAP! CLAP! CLAP! \"One. Two. Three. Eyes on me!\"\n\nIn unison, everyone stopped talking and directed their gaze towards Guy.\n\n\"Alright everyone, I've called you here today, instead of the classroom, to play a game!\" As he finished the statement, the eyes of the kids sparkled with excitement.\n\n\"A game?\" Durkas asked elatedly.\n\n\"That's right! But before we start, I want everyone to get into a team of two,\" Guy instructed. Right as he said so, the kids in the crowd split up and formed duos. Almost coincidentally Durkas was left without a partner.\n\n\"Umm, Teach. Who do I partner with?\" Durkas asked.\n\nGuy rubbed his chin and feigned contemplation. Then he snapped his fingers dramatically and suggested, \"Why don't you partner up with Kano?\"\n\nDurkas frowned and looked at Kano, who was hiding behind Guy.\n\n\"Him? What's he doing here?\" Durkas snorted.\n\n\"I completely forgot! From today onwards, Kano will be joining our class. Why don't you all welcome him?\" Guy declared softly while pushing Kano forward.\n\nKano inched up with a lowered head. Right as he stood before Guy, Durkas commented, \"Why's this idiot back in our group?\" causing Kano to visibly flinch.\n\nGuy's smile faded, and his expression turned stern.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-071]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":149,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 069 - Kano Reva","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy and Kano returned in the afternoon, following a filling lunch, in high spirits. Guy moved the prepared clay and a few other resources to his set up teaching area and called Kano to take a seat. Kano felt a little apprehensive in facing the blackboard once again, he never had any positive memories associated with it after all.\n\n\"Alright, Kano. It's time we got down to business! I wanted to talk to you about the problem you're facing in your studies,\" Guy began.\n\n\"After discussing with your previous tutor, as well as through my own observations, I was able to determine that you have a learning disability known as dyslexia.\"\n\nKano tilted his head in confusion. \"Dyslexia?\"\n\n\"Yes. It isn't a rare problem, a lot of children suffer from it. Basically, it makes it harder for you to do certain things that other kids your age find easy. You should already have some idea of what I'm talking about.\"\n\nKano nodded sorrowfully.\n\nGuy smiled and continued, \"Although that is the case, it doesn't mean that we cannot do anything to remedy the situation. You were born with it and, for better or worse, you have to live with it. I believe that every child must have equal opportunities in life. You were just dealt a different hand, and it is my job to help you get to a point where you can match up with others.\"\n\nGuy then wore a serious expression and pointed out, \"All of that is just my intention. I am prepared to go through this process and help you out. However, it still depends on whether you are willing to take the step forward with me. So, are you willing?\"\n\nKano bit his lips and lowered his head. He was feeling conflicted in trying to answer that question. It wasn't that Kano was unwilling to work with Teacher Larks. If anything, he was extremely enthusiastic. If what Teacher Larks said was true, then there was a way out for Kano from his current misery. But that was also what held him back from affirming the decision\n\n'What if it doesn't work out? What if I'm just stupid, and all the work Teacher Larks puts in goes to waste?' That was a question plaguing Kano's sensitive heart.\n\nOf course, Guy could glean all of this from Kano's expressions. This wasn't his first rodeo; he had worked with many kids just like Kano in his past life. Even the most mischievous of kids wanted to succeed in life. They just acted out because they were lacking attention, or were trying to cover up their insecurities with a tough facade.\n\n\"I can promise you that I can help you succeed. You aren't the first kids that I've worked with that suffers from dyslexia,\" Guy said soothingly.\n\nHearing that guarantee improved Kano's impression.\n\n\"O-Okay, I am willing!\" Kano said in a low yet resolute tone. Guy smiled and clapped his hand in elation. \"Wonderful!\"\n\nAnd with that, Guy walked up to one of the containers with the prepared clay and brought it close to Kano's desk.\n\n\"Alright! One of the problems you're facing is understanding what the letters of the language mean and sound like. It is easy to draw them from memory, but do you truly understand their significance?\" Guy asked rhetorically.\n\nHe pulled out a clump of clay and started kneading it between his hands. \"Thus, we will begin by going through the basic alphabets, once again. But this time, I want you to focus on what each letter sounds like, and what it looks like. Okay?\"\n\nGuy then place the clump in Kano's hands and walked up to the chalkboard. He raised the writing utensil and inscribed the first letter in upper and lower case with large font size.\n\n\"Aa. This letter has the sound 'Aa'. I want you to repeat after me, Aa,\" Guy said.\n\nKano answered with a low mutter, \"Aa...\"\n\n\"I can't hear you! Aa!\"\n\n\"Aa...\"\n\n\"Again, Aa!\"\n\nKano took a deep breath and exclaimed, \"Aa!\"\n\n\"Awesome! Now I want you to make this letter using the clay in your hand. Make sure it is large enough for you to see it from a short distance.\"\n\nKano nodded with seriousness and got busy with the soft clay. His hands worked the substance familiarly. He first rolled it between his open palms to elongate it. He then twisted and shaped the snaking clay into the upper case form of the letter within the minute.\n\n\"I want you to pronounce the letter's sound when you finish making it.\"\n\n\"Aa!\" Kano said as he smoothened the joints.\n\n\"Now I also want you to inscribe an arrow on the letter to show which direction it must be read and draw,\" Guy instructed, to which Kano readily complied.\n\nThe two then moved on to the lower case form, which was finished with equal ease.\n\n\"The next letter we will study is 'Buh'.\"\n\n\"Buh!\"\n\n\"Great! We will now do the same.\"\n\nThe duo continued their lesson into the early evening. Guy slowly took Kano through the individual letters and their sounds while repeating them loudly. In between, Guy would interrupt Kano and ask him what a letter he had made previously sounded like. As expected, Kano managed to answer all the questions, albeit after a long pause to recollect the answer. Guy didn't sweat Kano over that, he knew that the results were never immediate. He had to be patient and proceed one step at a time. As the sun began to set, Kano managed to complete the alphabets in their entirety. Guy sent the kid back after that and got down to his own work. He had a huge surprise planned out for Kano, the next day!\n\n____\n\nThe following morning, when Kano arrived at the class, he saw the letter's he had made the day before, yet they were a little different. Unlike yesterday, they seemed to have hardened greatly and had a significantly different feel to them. On top of that, there was also an intricate, circular design drawn on all of them that Kano had never seen before. He was immediately attracted to the drawings, they appealed to his sense of aesthetics.\n\n\"You're here early,\" Guy said with a smile as he walked over.\n\n\"After you left, I treated your models and added something special to them. I think you're going to like it!\"\n\nGuy went over to Kano and took the letter the boy was holding in his hands.\n\n\"What sound does this letter have?\" Guy asked.\n\nKano scratched his head and struggled to recollect the sound. After half a minute, the boy lowered his head dejectedly and said, \"Sorry, Teacher... I forgot.\"\n\nGuy patted the boy's head and said, \"Watch.\"\n\nHe placed the letter in Kano's hand and then channelled some mana into the spell circle he'd drawn on the letter. Right on queue, the circle lit up and a sound echoed in the duo's heads, \"Tuh.\"\n\nKano's eyes widened in excitement, \"Wow!\"\n\n\"Voice transmission through magic,\" Guy stated. Recently, Guy had stumbled upon a certain application of magic that he had seen many times in Eastern Fantasy web novels in his past life. The ability to transmit your voice directly to other people, without having to open your mouth - purely through magic. As expected, the ability existed in this world as well! The limit to voice transmission depended on the mage's mana domain, that is, you could only transmit your voice to people that were within your domain and were open to your mana signature.\n\nThe transmission ability was technically classified as a cantrip, so Guy found some difficulty in emulating it as a spell circle. It was analogous to overcomplicating the process of walking. Yet he was able to accomplish it nonetheless. Guy achieved it by equating voice transmission to how standard radio worked back on Earth. He figured out a way to convolute mental signals corresponding to voice, into mana. It involved another session of heavy research to accomplish it though, but Guy wasn't the least bit disappointed. This was because using his discovery, he was able to store his voice transmission inside the spell circle, and could have it activate anytime just by channelling an infinitesimally small quantity of mana.\n\nGuy reached into his jacket pocket and retrieved a moderately sized mana crystal he had saved up.\n\n\"Each of the letters here has this spell circle drawn on them. To activate it, you need to channel some mana into it. Since you aren't a mage, it will be hard for you to activate it using your own capacity. Therefore, you will need to use this mana crystal. I am going to show you how to activate it now.\"\n\nGuy then spent the first half of the day training Kano to sense his internal mana and send a short signal to the spell circles. Once he did that, the mana crystal would take over and handle the rest. Although it was Kano's first time, the boy was quick to grasp the nuances of basic mana control. Unlike literature, the boy was a natural in controlling his inherent mana, which came as a huge surprise for Guy.\n\nAfter that, Guy took out an illustrated children's book he had printed out the previous night and handed it to Kano.\n\n\"This book contains many short stories. I want you to try and read the very first one by tomorrow afternoon. You are allowed to use the letters you made to help you out if you don't know how to pronounce them. Tomorrow, I will ask you questions about details in the story to see how much you understood it. Okay?\"\n\nKano nodded and excitedly flipped open the book to begin reading.\n\nWhile the boy was doing that, Guy seamlessly escaped into the RoK and was greeted with the sight of Mast picking up the scattered kindergarten and pre-school level books.\n\n'It's great that I was finally able to use those. They were just burning a hole in the RoK.'\n\n(At the very least you could have returned them to the shelf after you were done with them,) Mast grumbled as he bent over.\n\n(Oh, by the way,) he said. (The RoK has recognised that you've earned a second student.)\n\n'Really?' Guy asked in surprise. 'Is it Kano?'\n\n(That appears to be the case. Congratulations! Three more before the next section opens up,) Mast added with a monotonous tone and resumed his cleaning.\n\nGuy helped him out a little bit and exited the RoK. Till sunset, Guy continued helping Kano understand the text and explaining the meaning of words he had never heard before. \n\nThankfully, the common language spoken in this world was unlike English in its complexity. Each letter had a specific and constant sound. And if a letter was used in a word, it was always pronounced. \n\nSilent letters, special vowel combinations, special consonant combinations, and so on, didn't exist in the common tongue. This made teaching literature to Kano infinitely easy.\n\nIn fact, as an educator, Guy despised his mother tongue, English, as it made his time teaching kids with learning disabilities immensely difficult. However, mastering the skill in \"hard mode\" made it much easier for Guy to adapt to teaching different languages to similarly afflicted kids, such as Kano.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-070]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":150,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 068 - Clowning Around","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nKano sat up and stretched his body while unleashing a loud yawn. He had never had such a pleasant sleep in his entire life. As he was enjoying the after-effects of his slumber, a hard pillow struck him from behind.\n\n\"Shut up, Kano! I'm trying to sleep,\" Dora cried out in a tired voice.\n\n\"S-Sorry,\" Kano replied as he bit his tongue.\n\n\"Why're you up so early?\" She added.\n\n\"T-T-Teacher Larks is working on a p-p-project, and he need m-m-my help,\" Kano answered with anticipation.\n\nHearing the man's name, Dora sprang up and declared, \"What are you helping him for? Don't you know that Matron dislikes that man! I forbid you from helping him!\"\n\nKano frowned and said, \"He isn't a b-b-bad person. You should try t-t-talking to him!\"\n\nDora pouted and responded, \"If I see you talking to him, then I'll- I'll never speak to you again!\"\n\nShe then turned around and curled back into her bed.\n\n\"Dora...\" Kano implored. \"D-D-Don't be so unreasonable!\"\n\nDora snorted in response and refused to answer. Kano sighed and stood up. As he left his room, he contemplated on his decision. In truth, he wanted to see what Teacher Larks had planned for the day. Although he was barely awake during his trip back home, he still remembered everything Teacher Larks said. And those words were nothing short of revelationary for Kano. His whole life, Kano felt that he was inadequate, stupid, doomed to be illiterate.\n\nEveryone kept telling him to try harder. Yet no matter how hard he tried, he kept failing in doing things that others found infinitely easy.\n\n'Am I not trying hard enough?' He would constantly ask himself. And each time, he'd push himself harder, and harder, only to fall flat on his bottom in the most spectacular manner.\n\n'Maybe I am stupid, like everyone says,' was the thought that nearly cemented itself within his psyche. That was until yesterday.\n\n\"I'm special,\" Kano muttered to himself with a resolute expression. \"Teacher Larks said so!\"\n\n____\n\nOnce Guy returned to the orphanage, he walked back to where he had stored his haul from yesterday.\n\nAlthough Guy wasn't a trained psychologist in his past life, he had learned through years of experience how to teach kids with dyslexia. Unlike other kids, those with dyslexia find it hard to decode language.\n\nAs an example, when an average child hears the word \"apple\", they are able to picture the image of the red fruit in their head. Those with dyslexia are unable to make that connection quickly. Adding on to that, after an average child reads the word \"apple\" they can easily catch that word the next time they see it in a text. They associate the sound of the word, with the written form of the word and the mental image of the word. This is also difficult for dyslexic kids.\n\nThese are just the issues faced within the literature, some dyslexic kids also find it difficult to process complex mathematical concepts that seem trivial or straightforward. An average child can process addition in its abstract state after understanding what the concept means. Unless a dyslexic child is properly taught to make the jump from literal addition to abstract addition, they can never process the operation in their heads.\n\nSo altogether, teaching a dyslexic child is impossible if the pedagogy style employed is the same as those without dyslexia - at least in the beginning stages anyway. Guy's current aim was to get Kano to a point where he could start coping with the kids of his own age. And without any magical potions or spells to \"cure\" dyslexia, Guy resorted to the only means he knew to help Kano get over his current roadblock and learn to live with his disorder.\n\nThat was why Guy had recruited Kano and Markus to collect a large quantity of clay yesterday. Through his travels in his past life, Guy had learned to become more resourceful. Without a controlled learning environment available, Guy was often faced with many challenges when he wanted to help kids with learning disorders. After stumbling along a few times, Guy drafted a solid set of solutions that could be implemented in any place.\n\nThankfully, the orphanage was in a location that wasn't so out of the way or isolated as some villages he had previously visited. There was a lot of natural vegetation, a plentiful spring, and even a large stretch of steps for him to work with.\n\nThe first move of his teaching plan was to process the clay and make it workable. As he beheld that large mound of unprocessed clay in front of him, he exhaled loudly in anticipation.\n\n\"Time to get to work!\" But right as he was about to get down and dirty, a low voice called out to him.\n\n\"W-Wait for me!\"\n\nGuy turned around noticed Kano running up to him. \"Kano! What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Y-Y-You said you needed m-m-my help for the project. I c-c-came to help!\"\n\nGuy laughed mirthfully and added, \"It's good that you're here. I hope you don't mind getting dirty?\"\n\nKano shook his head seriously and awaited instructions.\n\nAnd with that, the two began. Guy first added water to the clay and let it reach a viscous state. Through using magic, he could easily skip the process of retrieving water from the spring. As he activated a |Water Ball| spell, Kano exclaimed with an agape mouth and wonder in his eyes, \"Wow!\"\n\nGuy smiled and ruffled the boy's hair, \"Do you want to learn how to do this?\"\n\nKano nodded his head like a chicken pecking at grains.\n\nGuy held his chin to mimic contemplation and said, \"Hmmm, I guess I can teach you. But this depends on how well you do in my project. Can you do that?\"\n\nKano nodded much harder and narrowed his gaze with immense seriousness.\n\n\"Good boy!\"\n\nOnce Guy wet the clay mixture, he used another customised spell by disseminating his mana through the mixture. He identified the clay particles in the slurry and began transferring them carefully into a large container, carefully separating impurities and unwanted residues such as pebbles, roots, and sometimes small insects! Kano retrieved additional containers from storage when he found the current one filling up.\n\nAfter Guy was satisfied with the separation, he then used another spell to separate the water from the mixture. As the clay became drier and drier, his mana consumption increased significantly. Guy wasn't planning to completely dry the clay, he only wanted to get it to a point where it was still kneadable and could hold itself together, but wasn't too gooey.\n\nWith that finished, Guy added a bit of clean sand by eyeballing the quantity.\n\n\"Time to mix it all in,\" Guy said to Kano, and the two began kneading the clay and sand mixture. As Guy worked the mass in his container, he chuckled over how easy the earlier bit was. Usually, all of this would have taken him half the day or longer. But with magic, everything became as easy as one-two-three. Guy could have very easily magicked the mixing process too. But he wanted to leave something for Kano, to give the kid a sense of accomplishment and ownership.\n\nThe two worked their containers, taking frequent breaks to massage their aching arms. After Guy was satisfied, he let the clay settle by wrapping up the container.\n\nThey then went to have lunch.\n\n____\n\n\"Dora, where's Kano?\" Grace asked with concern.\n\n\"Hmph! He's off playing with that man! 'Helping him on some project,' he said!\" Dora answered with a pout.\n\nGrace frowned and asked, \"What kind of project?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He took Kano and Markus out to the spring yesterday and the three brought back a lot of mud.\"\n\n\"Mud?\" Grace asked in a low mutter. She wouldn't be lying if she admitted that she disliked that man, Guy Larks. From the very first day she met him, she got this awkward vibe from him. It was the way he looked at her and talked to her.\n\n'It's just like them!' The moment those faces flashed into her mind, her legs threatened to buckle. But she quickly caught herself. She glanced at Dora and sighed in relief when she saw the girl running up to some flower along the side of the path.\n\n'But it isn't \"exactly\" like them,' she mentally added. There was a desire in the man's eyes, but there was also regret, and a third emotion she had never seen before. It felt warm and wholesome, completely unlike 'them'. They only had desire, a lot of desire, and maliciousness!\n\nGrace quickly shook off those images from her mind and picked up her pace. Once she approached the orphanage, she walked around to the back to see what the man was up to.\n\n\"Ouch, that h-h-hurts!\" Kano's voice exclaimed.\n\nGrace entered a heightened state of alertness as she frantically searched around for some sort of weapon. She grasped at a broken broom leaning against the wall and rushed towards the sound.\n\n\"I know. Why don't you let me finish instead?\" The man's voice responded, causing Grace to slow her pace.\n\n\"No! Teacher Larks, I p-p-promised I would help you with the p-p-project!\" Kano retorted anxiously.\n\n\"I know you did. But you won't be of any help if you're aching all over, right? Let me take it from here.\"\n\nShe then heard a resolute denial from Kano followed by the sound of rushing steps.\n\n\"Hey! Wait for me!\" The man said with a chuckle mixed with a sense of defeat.\n\nShe carefully approached the corner and looked around, only to be greeted by a funny sight of the two covered in mud and smiling like idiots!\n\n'What the hell are they doing?'\n\nHer question was answered by Kano, \"H-H-How much longer do we need to work the c-c-clay?\"\n\nGuy rubbed his chin subconsciously as he pondered on the question, \"A few more minutes, that's all.\"\n\nHis answer was met with a light chuckle from Kano.\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\nKano covered his mouth with his hands and pointed at Guy's chins. Guy looked at a puddle nearby and realised that he had smeared the clay on his chin. He then looked at Kano and laughed harder.\n\nKano stared back blankly, to which Guy pointed at Kano's mouth. By reflex, Kano licked his lips only to catch a swatch of clay.\n\n\"Ptoo! Ptoo!\" He spat out amidst the roaring laughter from the man. Grace wanted to walk over and knock Guy's head, but then the man quickly cast some spell and conjured water to clean Kano's face.\n\nGrace grunted in satisfaction and decided to leave the two to their devices. \"They're just playing around,\" she added to assuage herself.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-069]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":151,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 067 - Inevitabilities","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nGuy wasn't the least bit surprised in learning that dyslexia existed in this magical new world. It was common back on Earth, and Guy figured that since base humans had evolved to a similar stage in this world, certain neurological conditions, developmental disorders, and mental illnesses should also be equally present. What did surprise him, though, was that there were little to no remedies or treatments to those problems in this world? After all, given how magic and mana was commonplace here, it wouldn't be a stretch to expect that there were equally magical treatments for these conditions, disorders, and illnesses.\n\nAnd yet, reality proved otherwise, because Guy just couldn't glean any solutions through his search. Of course, he was limited to the village and his search would obviously be biased in that sense. Guy really wished that he had access to a library or a repository of some sort catering to medical experts. However, he also realised that without any recommendation or backing, he couldn't access them.\n\n\"I haven't heard of such illnesses through my travels,\" Krish said while tilting his head in trying to recollect information.\n\nAnother discovery that surprised Guy, was in finding out that Krish Nara, the man who secured Guy his job as a local tutor, happened to be a veritable powerhouse when it came to information of any kind. No matter how obscure or out-of-the-way the question may be, Krish would have an answer to it. If not, he would provide a suitable direction for research that could lead to a greater understanding of the topic. During his time here, Guy had managed to build rapport with this mysterious man and had formed a certain friendship.\n\nHowever, 'Friendship' would be a twisted way to put it. The two were friendly and courteous with each other, but under the surface, they were both digging into each other's background and trying to suss out their true purpose.\n\nGuy wanted to know the reason why Krish helped him out earlier. Nothing came for free, and things that usually did had conditions imposed in tiny writing behind a flap of some kind that could easily be overlooked. Was this man related to the original Guy in some way? Did this man have any ulterior motives? Many such questions were circling Guy's head that he wanted immediate answers to. But Guy knew that no good would come with barraging them at Krish. Best case scenario: the man would feel miffed at the intrusion and summarily close himself off. Worst case scenario: the man would rain destruction so terrible that it would wipe this entire village out of the face of this planet. Guy didn't know what kind of backing or power this seemingly weak old man had, and he wasn't looking to experiencing it first hand either. Hence, Guy employed the gentle approach and formed a surface friendship with Krish.\n\nKrish, on the other hand, wanted to know why his Heavenly Eye was telling him that Guy was dead? He wanted to know why the fortune of this village underwent a 180-degree shift within a day? He wanted to know if the two details were related in some way, or if they were all coincidental? Maybe this was a sign that Krish's end was approaching causing his power to fluctuate and act out? Whatever the case may be, the only solution would be to personally investigate the situation. However, he couldn't just tie up Guy and physically squeeze the information out of him!\n\n'I don't do that anymore,' he chuckled internally. His personality had become tempered through his millennium of experience. He had learned that when it came to mortals, it was often the gentle and systematic approach that offered the greatest rewards. Like the old saying went, \"One shouldn't use a |Flamestrike| to grill pork.\" It was best to match the means to the target.\n\n\"Really? There have to be some records on this topic. I refuse to believe that no one has ever experienced or seen such problems before!\" Guy commented in response.\n\nKrish exhaled loudly through his nose and spoke in ponderance, \"I do recollect a case along the same vein. Have you heard of The Soaring Sword Sect?\"\n\nGuy shook his head, \"I don't think I have.\"\n\n\"During my travels, I once stayed over there. Really wonderful folk, not like most other sects I've been to. They were deep into cultivation of Sword Intent, do you know what that is?\"\n\nGuy shook his head again.\n\n\"Anyone can wield a sword. It's not a hard thing to do. But it is hard to wield it without hurting yourself. Those that can accomplish that often train for years to become experts in swordsmanship. Amongst those swordsmen, those with potential for magic can train in a series of skills that complement their swordsmanship called Sword Arts. These extend the mortal swordsmanship styles by imbuing and manipulating mana in some particular way. Mages that have mastered multiple Sword Arts, and choose to cultivate their sword skills more deeply, pursue an elusive concept often known as Sword Intent. A mage that can manifest Sword Intent is said to have reached a realm where they become one with the sword and can perform their Sword Arts without needing a physical sword to channel the power. Manifesting Sword Intent is often the step-off point into higher realms in cultivating swordsmanship. And that is exactly what mages in The Soaring Sword Sect pursue with immense fervour. They are so involved in this pursuit that they often seclude themselves from the world for years on end.\"\n\nKrish paused before continuing, \"I say they were wonderful because they seldom interfered in the mortal world unless certain events blatantly offended a set of codes established by their sect ancestors. So anyway, there was this kid, the Sect Leader's latest direct disciples, that had to go on an extermination mission raised by a township that neighboured the sect. With his position and reputation, the kid was extremely arrogant and entitled. He felt that he was above everyone just because the Sect Leader chose him out of 1000 others. He thought the extermination mission was easy and beneath him, yet the Sect Leader pushed him to take it in hopes of tempering the boy's mentality. As you would have guessed, the mission wasn't as easy as the boy figured it to be. He had to confront a large bandit group led by a mage in the same realm as him. The boy went in without planning and peacocked his affiliation. The entire camp attacked him together. Once the minions softened him up, the leader came in for the killing blow.\n\n\"But the Sect Leader was keeping an eye the entire time, so he interfered and handled the matter. The boy, though, was thoroughly affected. Coming face to face with his mortality and his inadequacy did a number on him. It completely shattered his ego, developing Inner Demons in the process. The following time he attempted a breakthrough, he suffered a serious backlash and crippled his cultivation.\"\n\n\"Inner Demons?\" Guy mimicked.\n\nKrish affirmed with a hum and added, \"He became reclusive and started to second guess everything. He was easily irritated, started to drink excessively, constantly exuded an aura of hopelessness, and was always checked out. The Sect Leader didn't know what to do. The boy happened to have a special physique that made him more perceptive to Sword Intent. He was meant to soar the skies as the youngest mage to ever manifest the Sword Intent. In many ways, the Sect Leader felt responsible for how things turned out.\"\n\n\"Wasn't he, though?\" Guy asked with a hint of surety, to which Krish denied, \"It was a foregone conclusion. An inevitability, if you will. The boy was born with great fortune, but he was doomed to never realise it.\"\n\n\"You must have already seen that, right?\"\n\n\"I did. And when the Sect Leader asked me about the boy's fortune, I told him about it. It was for that reason that the Sect Leader sent the boy on the mission in the first place! To temper the kid and help him unleash his full potential.\"\n\n\"You must have also seen the boy's descent following his failure.\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"And you didn't warn the Sect Leader?\"\n\nKrish smiled mysteriously and answered, \"He didn't ask. Mages think that just because they can cultivate beyond mortality and exceed their limits, they can go against their fortune and fate. The reality is far from that. In many ways, the Sect Leader was equally as arrogant as the boy. He thought that just because he had an insight into the future, he could change it. He believed that with his unparalleled strength and wisdom, he could play as a Deity.\"\n\nGuy smiled bitterly and commented, \"It's ironic. There is this saying, 'One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.'\"\n\nKrish nodded enthusiastically and said, \"That is exactly it! I could tell you your entire future and you could do everything in your power to remedy it. Yet you will still end up in the same place. Life is filled with inevitabilities. It is not our place to mitigate them. All we can do is anticipate them and cushion ourselves as best as we can.\"\n\nWith some hesitation, Guy asked, \"So is there really no other way to go against destiny?\"\n\n\"There is,\" Krish said in an elongated tone. \"You cannot change your own destiny. Only the person who can peer into your destiny can personally step in and change it. But this is dangerous for both yourself and the person.\" \n\nAfter a much longer pause, Krish continued, \"There is another way, apparently. But it is much, much rarer and till sometime back, was considered impossible.\"\n\n\"And that is?\" Guy asked expectantly.\n\nKrish simply smiled and answered, \"I don't know yet.\"\n\nGuy's eyebrows twitched at that. He slowly stood up and said, \"Kano should be waking up any time now. I should get going.\"\n\nKrish smiled and walked Guy out. As Guy turned the corner, he started to ponder about his next course of action.\n\n\"Since this world offers no solution, I guess I must revert to what I'm familiar with,\" he muttered and began walking up the steps to the orphanage.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-068]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":152,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 066 - To Be Special","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\"So you're saying that there are particles smaller than an atom? That doesn't make sense. I thought the atom was the smallest possible division of matter,\" Markus commented.\n\n\"You are right. Atom is the smallest division of 'matter'. The particles that make up the atom, or subatomic particles, give the atom its specific properties. They don't have any material properties if that makes any sense. They are usually defined by their quantum states, which is a probabilistic measurement as we cannot know for sure what their state will be at any given time,\" Guy clarified.\n\nMarkus furrowed his brows and pondered on the revelation. \"I just can't get my head around it. I was already finding it difficult to imagine what an atom would look like, and now you're saying that there's something even smaller than that?\"\n\nGuy shrugged his shoulders and replied, \"I can feel your frustration. Much of what exists around us is just the way it is. To comprehend them, we must shift our thought paradigm to accommodate it.\"\n\n\"I guess so...\"\n\nGuy sighed and concluded, \"Why don't you spend some more time on it. Read through that workbook I gave you last time once again. Maybe that might lead to a breakthrough.\"\n\nMarkus nodded and returned to his room. Guy had set up an open-air classroom near the orphanage to conduct his future lessons for both Markus and for the kids he'd have to teach from the village.\n\n'You know, it would really help if I had access to those high school level textbooks and beyond. I've nearly run out of material, and there is only so much I can teach him from the top of my head.'\n\n(I can't help it. When I programmed the RoK, I hardcoded those restrictions. Unless you can rustle 4 more students, that section will remain locked.)\n\n'But I got more than 10 students just from accepting this teaching job! Why wasn't that recognised?'\n\n(They're recognising you through necessity. It is not a genuine acknowledgement.)\n\n'How can you even tell them apart? I thought you world builders couldn't compute such complex emotions.'\n\n(Well, I have a massive population to cross-reference from back in my world.)\n\nWhile Guy continued his conversation with Mast, Kano walked out from behind the corner of the wall he was peeking off of and approached the chalkboard cautiously.\n\n\"A-A-tm, no! At-, ha! Parlit- parti- no... hmm,\" The boy strained his eyes and tried to make out the words written on the board while reading it out in a hushed tone. He hid so that he could easily occlude himself from Guy's vision, however, as a mage, it wasn't so easy for Guy to miss such an obvious source of sound.\n\nGuy was drawn out from his internal conversation the moment he heard the boy's attempts. He didn't want to interrupt the boy and cause him to feel self-conscious, and so Guy maintained his silence and avoided drawing any attention.\n\n\"Suda- subal- subalomic. That doesn't make any sense...\" The boy plummeted onto his buttocks and covered his face with his palms in defeat.\n\n\"Subatomic,\" Guy interjected.\n\n\"Huh? Ah!\" The boy tried to stand up and make a getaway, however, he slipped and fell back on his buttocks.\n\n\"So-Sorry. I d-d-didn't mean to d-d-disturb you,\" Kano said apologetically.\n\nGuy waved his hands, \"Don't worry about it. Why don't you try reading from a little closer? Maybe that might help?\"\n\nThe boy lowered his head shyly and complied. He walked up to the chalkboard and tried to read its contents once again. Unfortunately, he couldn't fare any better even after bridging the distance.\n\n\"I c-c-can't do it!\" The boy blurted in defeat.\n\n\"Is it that you don't know how to read? Or that you're finding it difficult to read?\" Guy inquired in a flat tone.\n\nKano stared at Guy blankly. Somehow, to him, those questions managed to dig into the root of his problems. Kano knew that he wasn't illiterate. He had been learning with his sister for over a year now. Yet, even though his sister had managed to grasp the concepts and build upon them, he was still stuck where they started.\n\n\"It's difficult,\" Kano answered.\n\n\"Hmm, are the letters moving around or dancing in your eyes?\" Guy added with a smile, to which the boy nodded.\n\nGuy scratched his chin lightly and furrowed his brows. \"I want to try a few tests. Are you busy, Kano?\"\n\nKano shook his head in response. Guy pulled Kano towards a desk and chair and had him sit. Kano followed Guy's instructions and prepared himself for the 'tests' Guy was about to send his way. Surprisingly, these 'tests' turned out to be a series of games that Kano had never seen before.\n\nIt was fun in the beginning, but Kano quickly found it hard to keep up and began losing. He started feeling dejected, but Guy kept encouraging him and pushed him to move forward. Kano's first test was to match a set of cards with words written on them with cards that had pictures of the objects the words referred to. He managed to connect one or two, but he couldn't decipher the rest.\n\nIn the next test, Kano was blindfolded and placed in an empty area. Guy would shout out instructions that Kano had to follow to navigate in the field, such as \"move two steps to the right\", or \"walk back by five steps\".\n\nThere were other games like this, such as writing down dictated words or reading short sentences within a time limit and rewriting it without looking.\n\nKano quickly found himself feeling more and more inadequate with each passing test. Guy was observant of this and always maintained a jovial and encouraging attitude. His intention wasn't to discourage Kano, rather he was trying to confirm his initial diagnosis, that Kano was dyslexic.\n\nGuy had a lot of experience with this learning disability because it wasn't uncommon back on Earth. Quite a handful of kids he'd worked with suffered from this disability and were often victims of excessive bullying. Through the years, Guy had become more perceptive in noticing the details and hints that pointed towards such disabilities and made it a point to rehabilitate these children as soon as possible. The moment Guy noticed Kano struggling to read, his mental radars quickly resounded with Kano's possible bout with dyslexia. In fact, he'd also gleaned some information from the elderly tutor about all the kids he would have under him, and he made a special note to pursue this hypothesis as soon as possible. It was just convenient that he managed to catch Kano so swiftly. \n\nKano sighed in defeat and sunk into the chair, \"S-s-stupid...\"\n\nGuy unleashed a warm smile and started, \"Kano, I want to undertake a large project, and was hoping you could help me out?\"\n\nKano tilted his head and asked, \"Why me?\"\n\n\"Actually, it's something only you can do.\"\n\nKano's eyes sparkled with curiosity; he nodded enthusiastically.\n\n\"Wonderful! Quick, go and get Markus. We might need his assistance to get started!\" Guy instructed eagerly and nudged Kano along.\n\nAs he saw the little boy running away, Guy walked towards the orphanage's storage room and retrieved multiple woven baskets. He then went down the steps into the village and borrowed a few shovels. When he returned to the orphanage, he saw Markus waiting with an anxious Kano.\n\n\"Are you guys ready?\" Guy asked the two kids.\n\n\"What are we going to do, Master?\"\n\nGuy picked up the baskets and handed them to Markus. \"We're going to shovel for clay!\"\n\n____\n\nThe trio worked tirelessly until sunset and shovelled muddy clay from the banks of the spring near the mountain. Kano and Guy would shovel the mud and fill up the baskets, while Markus acted as the mule that shuttled from the spring to the orphanage to deposit the harvested mud. The poor boy was pained all over by the time they finished their work.\n\nOnce they finished, Guy took the two kids a little ways upstream to take a bath and cleanse themselves after a day of hard work. On the way back, he carried the fatigued Kano on his back and let the boy fall asleep.\n\n\"Why were we collecting so much clay, Master?\" Markus asked while massaging his back.\n\n\"It's for your little brother. I'm going to be teaching him,\" Guy answered.\n\nMarkus raised his eyebrows in appreciation, yet added with hesitation, \"I fear it might be difficult. The tutor from the village told me about Kano's problem...\"\n\nGuy ruffled Markus' hair and chimed in, \"Your brother isn't stupid if that's what you're thinking. He's different, he's special! Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. If you judge him with the same criteria that are used to measure everyone else, of course, you'll find that Kano falls short. He may be weak when it comes to things that everyone finds trivial, but have you ever measured the extent of his strengths. I promise you that Kano will leave everyone else in the dust when it comes to that!\"\n\nMarkus nodded with a serious expression and followed along. When they reached the orphanage, Guy carefully lifted Kano and handed him to Markus, and then left to his own bedroom.\n\nAfter he arrived, Guy took off his clothes to prepare to go to bed. When he disrobed his outerwear, though, Guy noticed a large water stain marring the upper-back and shoulder region.\n\n\"Seems that he wasn't completely asleep,\" Guy commented with a smile and left the cloth out to dry.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-067]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":153,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 065 - Too Convenient to be a Happenstance","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\nGuy's timely intervention may have saved Markus, but it unwittingly dropped him into Grace's warpath.\n\n\"You! Fix this!\" She demanded.\n\n\"I can't force him to do anything,\" Guy replied apologetically.\n\n\"Then why are you even here?\"\n\nGuy looked at Markus, who understood the gaze and chimed in, \"I invited Master to stay with us for the time being, since he's out of a job.\"\n\n\"We can't afford to house a lodger!\" Grace denied immediately.\n\nBefore Markus could interject and plead his case, Guy decided to take the initiative and started his piece, \"Actually, I can pay rent. Apart from that, I can also help out with any tasks that may arise. I am also an orphan, so I have some experience handling chores and managing an orphanage.\"\n\nWhen Grace learned that Guy was an orphan, her opinion of him softened a little. However, she didn't let him off the hook just yet.\n\n\"Fine! Since you're so hellbent on your decision, I won't force you anymore,\" She declared as she flung her hands in the air. She then added to Markus, \"Take your Master with you and clean up the storage room at the back. There should be a mattress and a few old pieces of furniture, air it out and clean it. If you need anything else, get it yourself! We'll discuss the specifics of your stay here tomorrow!\"\n\nAfter unloading a tirade filled with warnings and demands, Grace swiftly left the area, leaving Markus and Guy alone.\n\n\"I'm sorry Master. I'll try to convince Matron when she is in a better mood to waive the rent.\"\n\nGuy quickly shook his hands and replied, \"Actually, I'm not as destitute and impoverished as you think. I actually have a decent sum saved up for myself.\"\n\n\"Master you don't have to say all that to soothe me. This is all my fault! I should have written a letter to Matron before coming here uninvited. Or I should have at least waited for my sister to be present. She would know how to calm things down. Worry not, Master. I will go in and clean up your room. Please relax and look around!\"\n\nMarkus rushed inside without a second of pause and got to work.\n\nGuy sighed and then chuckled mirthfully. No matter how hard he tried to convince Markus that he was loaded, the boy just refused to believe it. 'I don't know if I should feel fortunate or offended that my student thinks of me this way...'\n\nGuy decided to survey the area while Markus was busy with his task. It was his first time travelling after arriving in this world, and he was feeling intoxicated with the spirit of adventure. One of the reasons why Guy felt so enamoured with pursuing charity work in his past life was because he truly enjoyed the idea of visiting different places and immersing himself in the myriad of cultures.\n\nBut he realised quite early that with the advancements in technology, it would be quite difficult to feel the rush of exploring uncharted territories and indulging in unknown and untouched cultures. However, in this world, everything was new to him. He was feeling giddy just thinking about his future travels.\n\nHe wanted to visit the village at the base of the mountain, however, before that, he wanted to thoroughly familiarise himself with the region around the orphanage. Although it was snugly fit along the sides of the mountain, the area was surprisingly flat and even. It was as if someone had carved out a region and reshaped the mountainside to specifically house this orphanage. The orphanage itself looked peculiar at a closer viewing. Through delving into the old Guy's memory, Guy knew for a fact that not all orphanages had such planned and purposeful design.\n\nUsually, those buildings would match the area around them. In this case, the orphanage should look like the houses and buildings constructed in the village. And yet it had a more intricate and artistic construction, though the years had definitely stripped away its elegance.\n\n'There's a story behind this building,' Guy surmised. He planned to dig into it in the future, once he solidified his relationship with Grace.\n\nAs he circled the building, Guy happened to notice two tails following him. He decided to entertain himself and indulged the two followers. After he turned the nearest corner, Guy hid himself flush into the wall and waited for the duo to follow.\n\n\"Did he turn around there?\"\n\n\"Y-Y-Yes! I saw h-h-him!\"\n\n\"Shhh! Don't make any noise! Don't lose him either. We need to let Matron know what that suspicious-looking man is doing! Mimi told me that there have been cases of kidnappers stealing kids in the middle of the night and selling them to rich masters as slaves!\"\n\nGuy heard the excited voice of a girl and the apprehensive voice of a boy droning and approaching his area. Guy decided to prank the kids and activated a few spells to set up a visual illusion. To any passerby with untrained eyes, they wouldn't notice his presence no matter how hard they looked.\n\n\"Where did he go?!\"\n\n\"I d-d-don't know. He was here a s-s-second ago!\"\n\nA perky little girl hopped around the corner and swivelled her head in distress. Her two ponytails bounced against the side of her head like a rattle drum. Behind her, a thin and timid-looking boy followed and assisted in her search while straining his eyes. As Guy observed them, he found a lot of similarities in their facial structure and appearance. Barring their starkly opposing personalities, the two had many features in common. He knew that they were related in some way.\n\n\"Oh no, Kano! He got away! Quick, we need to find Matron Reva and let her know!\" The girl grabbed the boy's hand and ran feverously.\n\n\"Dora, w-w-wait!\" The boy cried out and disappeared around the corner with his sister.\n\nGuy chuckled as he saw the two tumbling around while running. 'Dora and Kano,' he said to himself in a pensive voice.\n\nAfter finishing his tour of the area, Guy figured that it was time to visit the village and make his acquaintance with the locals. Through experience, he knew that often establishing his presence and building a few connections with the villagers could work wonders for him in the future.\n\nHe carefully descended the steps from the orphanage towards the village, all the while preoccupying himself with the arduous thought of climbing back up.\n\nAs he stepped off of the final step, he noticed a middle-aged man pacing about anxiously. Guy didn't want to interrupt the man's contemplation and decided to circle around him silently. However, the man immediately noticed Guy and approached him with an excited skip.\n\n\"Hey there! Haven't seen you here in these parts before,\" He greeted with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Yes, I just arrived today. The name's Guy Larks, I will be staying up at the orphanage from now on.\"\n\n\"G and L!\" The man muttered. \"You wouldn't happen to be from the city, right?\"\n\n\"I am! How did you know?\" Guy responded with confusion.\n\nThe man overlooked Guy's question and continued, \"Were you working as a teacher there?\"\n\n\"I was! I'm sorry, have we met before?\"\n\n\"Are you looking for a job?\"\n\n\"I am!\"\n\nAs Guy fielded the barrage of highly specific and relevant questions, a sense of discomfort rose from within. He wanted to figure out how the man knew so much about him, yet before he could inquire any further, Guy found himself being led by the man through the village.\n\n\"Excuse me, where are we going?\" Guy asked along the way.\n\n\"Just so happens, there's a job opening for a tutor in this village. My mama will let you know more about it!\" The man replied while picking up his pace with a slight hop in his steps.\n\nA minute later, Guy found himself in front of a quaint home closer to the village centre. Unlike the others, this one happened to have a larger backyard, which was fenced off.\n\n\"Please come in, make yourself at home! Wife, we have another guest!\" The man bellowed while entering his home.\n\nGuy scrunched his eyebrows and followed along apprehensively, 'Everything feels so convenient. Too convenient!'\n\nOnce Guy entered the living area of the small home, he noticed the man who led him here speaking with an elderly woman and an aged yet surprisingly spry looking man.\n\n\"Great master-\"\n\n\"Please just call me Krish. Hearing you address me like that makes me feel so old,\" The elderly man interjected mirthfully.\n\n\"I wouldn't dare!\" The guide retorted. \"Your prediction was right once again, great master! I found a man matching your description who can take over for mother. Here he is!\"\n\nThe guide gestured at Guy Larks and invited him over to take a seat, \"Teacher Larks, this is great master Krish Nara. He was the one who predicted your arrival today.\"\n\nGuy bowed respectfully and sat down.\n\nKrish smiled meaningfully at Guy and continued talking with the elderly woman. \"As I said, after checking the outlook into your future I noticed some grave signs. So I found it imperative to bring it to your attention. Currently, your work as a tutor in this village, while meritorious, has greatly affected your health. I recognise that the job is stressful, especially when you have to handle children that are many generations younger than you. Coincidentally, my future-sight determined the arrival of a suitable and much younger replacement who would arrive here desperately in search of a job.\"\n\nKrish then gazed at Guy and continued, \"Young man. You were laid off from your previous profession as a teacher of magic at the Radiant Academy, correct?\"\n\nGuy nodded incredulously.\n\n\"As you can see, this man is more than qualified to carry the baton forward. In order to qualify as a teaching apprenticeship at the Radiant Academy, one must be knowledgeable in basic subjects after all.\"\n\nThe elderly woman smiled in relief and said, \"Once again, you've saved my life, great master.\" She then turned to Guy and added, \"Young man, I've been teaching the kids in this village for over thirty years now. I am coming of age, and hope to retire and spend the remainder of my life in leisure. However, I can't bear to leave without ensuring that there is someone to carry on in my stead. Since great master Nara is vouching for your accomplishments, I have no reason to hesitate any further. Are you willing to become a tutor for the children of this village?\"\n\nGuy was overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events. Miraculously, everything started to fall into place for him. He now had a job, and a valid reason to continue staying in this village. Grace could no longer ditch him midway!\n\n'It's the work of this man!' Guy also recognised that these conveniences were in a large part, the work of the elderly man who the locals called great master Krish Nara. Guy knew that when things came so easily, there was always a caveat. Yet, he couldn't find anything even after running his mind to the max. Although his mana senses weren't fully polished, a cursory inspection indicated nothing of note in Krish's body either. For all intents and purposes, he appeared to be a regular man.\n\nSo, although it all felt a little suspicious, Guy couldn't find any reason not to acquiesce to the offer. Thus, answered with a respectful bow, \"It would be my honour to carry forward in your stead as a tutor in this village.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-066]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":154,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 064 - All a Coincidence","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nGuy stared incredulously at the visage glaring back at him. The resemblance was eerily uncanny.\n\n'She's exactly like Grace when I first met her!' The myriad of travels he and Grace undertook since their early twenties back on Earth had affected her physically and emotionally. Before they began their venture, she used to have a more cold and fenced off aura that dissuaded others from approaching her. It was only after getting to know her at a personal level that Guy realised the underlying reason for her frigid demeanour.\n\n'If only I had known about it earlier, I could have made so much more progress in our relationship,' Guy lamented. But then he quickly shook off that thought, because standing here in front of him was his second chance!\n\n\"Have you met Miss Grace before, Master?\" Markus inquired.\n\n\"Master? Markus, who's this?\" Grace interjected.\n\n\"You're name's Grace?\" Guy exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes. Who're you?\"\n\n\"This is my Master, Matron Reva,\" Markus clarified.\n\n\"Reva? Are you... you're a mother?\" Guy asked hesitantly while gesturing between Markus and Grace.\n\n\"What? No! Again, who are you? Who is this, Markus?\"\n\n\"No, Master. Since we're all orphans, we decided to take Matron Reva's last name as a sign of solidarity. And Matron, this is Master.\"\n\n\"I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME!\" Grace exploded. She released a long exhale and let the silence settle.\n\n\"Now, one at a time,\" she pointed at Markus and reiterated. \"Markus, who is this person? And please, don't tell me he's your Master again!\"\n\n\"This is my Master, Teacher- I mean Mister Guy Larks. He's the teaching apprentice I was learning under.\"\n\n\"Great! Next question, what are you doing back so early? We weren't expecting you for another year,\" Grace replied with visible confusion.\n\n\"That? I... I dropped out...\" Markus replied in a low voice.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Grace raised her eyebrows in disbelief. She craned her neck closer and narrowed her eyes.\n\n\"I dropped out of the Academy,\" Markus confessed in a shaky tone.\n\n\"Why? Did something happen?\" Grace asked with concern. She placed the basket in her hand on the ground and walked up to Markus and embraced him gently.\n\n\"It's alright. Everything is going to be ok. It's fine even if you couldn't become a mage, we can find something else for you. OK?\" She said in a soothing voice while patting the back of Markus' head.\n\nMarkus wiggled out of her embrace while blushing in embarrassment. \"That's not it! I didn't fail in becoming a mage.\"\n\nHe pulled out his magic wand and cast a massive |Fireball| directed towards the sky.\n\nGrace huddled back in fear as she beheld the |Fireball| hurtling skywards. Her face contorted with an expression of unimaginable terror. Her legs started to shake and give way, but she quickly stabilised herself and began to breathe measuredly. While she was doing so, Guy rushed forward immediately and snatched the wand from Markus.\n\n\"What are you doing?!\" Guy reprimanded. In response, Markus lowered his head and retreated his head into his neck.\n\n\"Sorry, Master. I... wasn't thinking straight.\"\n\n\"Damn right you weren't! I'm confiscating this! You will get it back once you've properly contemplated your actions. I've taught you better than this, Markus. I'm extremely disappointed in you,\" Guy continued.\n\nWhile the Master was disciplining his Disciple, Grace finally managed to calm herself and steadied her breathing. She coughed loudly to attract the duo's attention.\n\n\"Since you've become a mage as you've wanted, why did you drop out?\"\n\n\"I dropped out because they fired Master,\" Markus answered righteously while avoiding Guy's eyes.\n\nGrace gazed blankly at Markus. A stale silence hung in the air.\n\n\"WHAT?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!\" Grace finally burst in anger and exclaimed animatedly.\n\n\"Do you have any idea what your sister and I had to go through to get you admitted into that Academy? In fact, I was against it from the very beginning, it was she who convinced me in the end. And what did you do with her efforts? You dumped it into the mud and trampled all over it! Even now, she's out travelling with some caravan and scrounging money just to send it to you! You, who dropped out of Academy! And for what? Because they fired this clown?\" She added while pointing aggressively at Guy.\n\n\"Matron, please don't insult my Master like that!\" Markus interrupted.\n\n\"MASTER? He's your Master?\" She commented in disbelief. \"Who even are you?\"\n\nGuy walked forward and politely answered, \"Hello, I am Guy Larks.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you Guy Larks. Could you please do me the honour of introducing yourself?\" Grace responded sarcastically.\n\n\"I'm an unemployed teaching apprentice,\" Guy responded with a chuckle. This banter reminded him of his conversations with Grace back on Earth. At that time, everyone hated Grace for her snarky sarcasm. Not Guy though. He loved to play into it because he knew that she never had a comeback. And coincidentally, this Grace was also stumped at Guy's shameless retort.\n\n\"You think this is funny?!\" Grace screamed as she marched closer to Guy. \"I don't know what you did to fool this boy so well. But if you have an ounce of integrity in your heart, you will convince him to go back! Get him back into the Academy. Beg if you have to!\"\n\n\"No, Matron! I'm not going back there again,\" Markus denied vehemently.\n\n\"You don't get to say anything, you stupid boy!\"\n\n\"But Matron, you have no idea how-\"\n\nAnd then the two entered a back and forth that started to barrel out of control. Markus fervently denied even considering returning to the Academy, while Grace pushed at him harder and harder to do the opposite. Guy observed the situation with longing eyes as he reminisced about another similar occurrence from his past life.\n\nAt that time, Grace got into an intense argument with an 8-year-old orphan boy who had recently lost his family due to a drought. He was so closed off from everyone that he refused to utter a single word or eat another bite of food. Somehow Grace got through. She managed to grasp at something that peeved that boy so furiously that he completely forgot about his oath of silence and debated with her with unwavering conviction. In between, Grace casually handed an opened can of biscuits into his hands, which the boy then nibbled at while haranguing at her. Guy thought that Grace was ingenious to skillfully break through the boy's barriers and get through to him. But it was only at a later date that he learned from her that she was actually serious when she argued with that boy!\n\n'They're just so similar... Mast, what's happening?' Guy asked internally.\n\n(What are you talking about?)\n\n'Why is she here? Why is Grace here? Is she also a transmigrant?' Guy added with some anticipation.\n\n(Hmm. No. She's a native,) Mast answered casually.\n\n'But, how? They both look the same. They both have the same name. They both even have the same personalities! This is far too convenient to be a coincidence!'\n\n(And yet, that is exactly what it is,) Mast answered monotonously.\n\n'But that doesn't make any sense! The probabilities have to line up so perfectly for everything to match up to such an extent.'\n\n(And yet, that is exactly what happened.)\n\n'You're joking! Are you hiding something from me, Mast?' Guy interrogated.\n\nMast sighed and answered casually, (No, I am not. Believe it or not, this is really all a coincidence. That woman has nothing to do with the woman with the same name that was acquainted with you in your past life.)\n\n'Then... was this fate?' Guy commented. No matter how many times he tried to convince himself before his death, Guy managed to overcome his greatest regret of not being able to follow through after confessing to the love of his life. Even after being handed a second chance, he was finding it hard to open himself to the experience of falling in love again and pursuing another woman. Maybe it was because Grace was his first love, and was someone who was so deeply implanted into his heart, that he couldn't get over her. And yet, in his second chance, Guy was given another shot at pursuing Grace! Maybe the universe was finally being generous with him. After dumping all over him in his past life, was it making it up to him now?\n\nBut Mast summarily burst Guy's bubble by saying, (Don't flatter yourself. The world doesn't revolve around you. This is all just a coincidence. The result of numbers lining up in the same order for the second time. Neither I nor any other agent had any hand in this.)\n\n'You say that. But think about it! You just coincidentally happened to drop me into the body of this man, who just so happened to be close to this woman. If that is not fate, then I don't know what is!'\n\n(Who knows. Maybe you are right! Maybe this is all fate and I'm just another chess piece in the game of someone stronger and greater than I.) Mast then emulated a mechanical chuckle and followed up, (That was my attempt at sarcasm. I think I'm getting a hang of it.)\n\nGuy grumbled internally as he returned to himself in the present. He felt an excess of excitement as he began to formulate a plan to pursue Grace once again. But he was immediately distracted by the sorry sight of Grace pinching Markus' ear and giving him a thorough spanking with the other hand.\n\n\"Everyone, please! Let's take a second to calm down and talk things out,\" Guy suggested. To which he was greeted by an accusatory gaze from Grace.\n\n\"You! You're the reason for this mess!\" She started.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-065]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":155,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 063 - Reversal of Fortune","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\"Oh no! I'm so screwed!\" Krish exclaimed in fear.\n\nWhat could cause an invincible powerhouse in the Tesseract Transformation realm to shiver in their boots?\n\nAn immensely auspicious golden aura had enveloped the village, a large portion of the mountain range containing Mount Tai, as well as the forest in its immediate vicinity!\n\nAs a reference, the brighter the aura appears through the Heavenly Eye, the greater the fortune. And the golden aura hanging over the area was so bright Krish was having difficulty keeping his attention on it.\n\nCompared to its greyish state yesterday, it was a reversal of unimaginable proportions - something Krish had only seen a handful of times in his lifetime. And in all those occasions it was because of his intervention. He had employed his Heavenly Eye and shifted the flow of destiny in a way that overturned the fortune of an entire sect.\n\n\"Oh no! I'm dead! I'm so- so dead!\" Krish cried as he began to inspect every part of his body.\n\n\"How did this happen?\" While still fumbling around, Krish immediately narrowed and heightened his senses within his mana field to cover the area blanketed in the auspicious golden aura. He inspected every single individual, every beast, every object down to the particles floating in the atmosphere, in search of the cause.\n\n\"But- I just offered some advice! I didn't even use my eye. How did this happen?\" He darted his attention around.\n\nFinally, he stopped on three particular individuals. Amongst them, two were twins, and the third was a teen girl.\n\nWhat fascinated him was that just yesterday, those three were a greyish-black shade through his Heavenly Eye. They were slated to perish soon. But now, they shone just as bright as the area around them.\n\nKrish just couldn't figure out what he had done to cause such a change. Worst yet, he was shivering over the impending destruction his body was going to face. Without knowing where the deviation was, he could never feel safe. Sure, he could always just level this village and cancel out the fortune the old-fashion way. But he simply couldn't get himself to do it.\n\n\"I'm dying anyway, what's the point?\"\n\nThus, Krish decided to extend his stay and observe the situation.\n\nHe waited for a week, yet nothing odd occurred. His body was fine, which meant that it was probably not a result of his interference. This shocked him further because people's fortunes are generally written in stone the moment they are born. It is possible to change it, but it requires insight into the flow of fortune, which in turn requires someone to be learned in a cultivation method such as The Heavenly Eye. There do exist cultivation methods in the world like it, but none of them are as effective as Krish's own. That is, those other powers cannot cause such a massive reversal.\n\nThis could only mean one thing: there was someone else equally powerful manipulating the field.\n\n\"But why this village, and why those three kids?\" Krish pondered.\n\nHe couldn't find the answer even after staying for a month. At that point, the mother-in-law of his host had arrived and he no longer had a place to live. So, Krish commissioned the village chief and a few men to help build him a house near the stairways that lead to the orphanage.\n\nOnce he settled there Krish continued his surveillance. \n\nHalf a year later, Krish saw a series of images in the golden cloud. Generally, he could observe these images all the time when gazing into other's fortunes. However, whenever a change occurred due to his intervention, the images would disappear and it would take some time for the new visions to emerge as the altered fortunes solidified.\n\nIn these choppy visions, Krish finally saw the sign he was so desperate for in the past 1000 years.\n\n\"Someone is fated here!\"\n\nNot just anyone can cultivate The Heavenly Eye, they need to be part of the universe's design. While it sounded nonsensical, if one really considered it, it would make complete sense. A cultivator of The Heavenly Eye was technically an individual divergent from the regular timeline. One could liken them to film projectionists.\n\nThe film reel is analogous to the expected flow of fortune. The projectionists that handle these reels can observe a rough outline of this trajectory through glancing at this reel. Additionally, they also have the power to splice out frames from the reel and add others in its place.\n\nHowever, while just about anyone can qualify to become a projectionist after training, it is not the same for cultivators of The Heavenly Eye. These individuals need to be fated and must be written into the natural flow of fortune. In other words, they need to be chosen by the universe itself.\n\nIf Krish decided to take in a random person and train them with this method, he would face a massive backlash from the universe.\n\nThe prospect of finally gaining a disciple greatly livened Krish. He decided to settle down, and wait for his disciple to pass through, or at least until the images in the cloud stabilised.\n\nWith that in mind, he waited. All the while he kept his senses trained on the three kids. The eldest had left a few days after his arrival. But her travels did not extend beyond the range of his mana field.\n\nAfter another half a year, something odd occurred. Two individuals entered his senses. One of them had the same golden hue as the cloud hanging over the village, which had greatly solidified from its earlier misty form, while the other was a shade of black so deep that the man appeared 2-dimensional.\n\nThis stumped Krish. He had seen such a form before, but that was when he faced the minions of a cultivator specialising in reanimation techniques. Only a dead being had such a void-black shade because they had no future.\n\nSurprisingly, this man who had a zombie's fortune, was not a walking corpse. He was very much alive!\n\nHis regular senses clearly indicated that the man was alive, yet his Heavenly Eye blared that the man was dead.\n\n\"That's... odd...\"\n\nTruly, this entire village was odd. Nonetheless, Krish was excited because he knew that this reversal had to do with this man. With a prospective disciple waiting for him around the horizon, he decided to extend his wait and observe how things progressed.\n\n____\n\nThe moment Guy saw the face of the woman who exited the orphanage, he was thrown back to a time before he transmigrated into this world.\n\nThe hospital's VIP room's door burst open and a woman who appeared to be in her mid-twenties charged in. Her eyes were red, indicating that she had cried earlier, yet her face exuded unbridled rage and anger.\n\nAs she walked, her arms flailed by her side and her body bounced in harmony. She had a short stature, yet her appearance radiated with maturity. She wasn't a classical beauty - her only appealing features were her emotive and piercing chestnut brown eyes - yet for Guy, she was dazzling in every way. Because Guy didn't like her for the way she looked, he was attracted to her soul.\n\n\"GUY! Why did I hear that you are rejecting the treatment?\" The woman didn't waste any time and got right to the point.\n\nGuy turned his head with some difficulty. He was laying on the hospital bed, set at a comfortable incline. His face looked pale and radiated a sense of weakness. He was completely bald, a side-effect of his past treatments, and his appearance was vastly emaciated.\n\n\"~Grace~\" Guy spoke in a raspy voice but with a sing-song intonation.\n\n\"Don't '~Grace~' me! Tell me, are you?\"\n\nGuy smiled bitterly and nodded in response. Grace furrowed her brows and pulled over a seat next to his bedside.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nGuy sighed and replied, \"I'm done, Grace. I feel pain every day, and there's no end in sight. The doctors say that my chances are bleak. I can't take it anymore.\"\n\n\"But there's still some hope, right?\" Grace responded pleadingly.\n\n\"Hope? This isn't living, Grace-\"\n\nBut Grace quickly interrupted, \"But what about your family? What about all those kids you've worked with? Why are you being so... selfish?!\"\n\nGuy exhaled and retorted, \"All my life, I've been giving and giving. I think I deserve to be selfish one last time?\"\n\n\"But... What about me?\" Grace added in a lowered voice. As she spoke her eyes began to water once again.\n\n\"Hey,\" Guy grasped Grace's hands and gently patted them. With a chuckle he spoke, \"Look at this! All this time, I'd been trying my darnedest to get you to open yourself up to me. Not once have I managed to break through your impenetrable barrier of ice. If I'd known that all it took to make a breakthrough was an imminent threat of death, I'd have gotten myself shot a few times back when we toured through Syria!\"\n\nGrace knocked Guy's shoulder with her fist and reprimanded him, \"How could you say that?!\"\n\nGuy laughed, but he was interjected by a furious fit of coughing, \"Ouch, that kinda hurt!\"\n\n\"Right!\" Guy remembered something and leaned towards the bedside table and opened the drawer. He retrieved a small, simple yet elegant box and handed it to Grace.\n\n\"I wanted to give this to you under better circumstances. But I don't think that's going to happen, so I want you to have this. I don't have many regrets in my life. Only one, and it was that I didn't have the courage or confidence to give this to you earlier. I was scared you would reject me. But now that I think about it, who cares if you had rejected me? You miss 100% of the shots you don't take, right?\"\n\nGrace carefully held the box and opened it up. As she did, she was greeted by a beautiful diamond ring. It had a small, yet intricately cut diamond, and a plain band that perfectly matched her style.\n\n\"Guy... this,\" Grace got choked up as she absorbed everything before her.\n\n\"Don't overthink things. I bought it way back and held on to it all this time. I am not expecting anything from you. I just want you to know how I feel about you from my mouth, and not from a third-person after my passing.\"\n\nGrace lost control of her emotions and started bawling. She covered her face and ran out of the room, leaving Guy alone by himself once again.\n\n\"Sigh... She still can't stand expressing her emotions in front of me. If only I had a little more time...\"\n\n____\n\n\"Grace...\" Back in present, Guy spoke audibly in a voice filled with a myriad of emotions.\n\nThe woman standing before him frowned, narrowed her chestnut brown eyes and asked, \"Yes? Have we met before?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-064]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":156,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 062 - Travelling Soothsayer","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nWhat is immortality? Is it to transcend mortality as an idea - an unwavering will and resolve? Or is it to literally transcend the bonds of mortality, and live for an eternity?\n\nBoth concepts are achievable in this world of magic. A mage can immortalise their sense of existence as an abstract thought through Ascension, or become unaging and eternal by reaching the Tesseract Transformation realm.\n\nThe Tesseract Transformation realm is the pinnacle achieved by any mage on their paths. To reach it, they need to advance through Foundation Establishment into Core Formation, then to Core Condensation, which leads into Tesseract Transformation. In reaching the realm, the mage essentially transcends the bounds of their mortal coils and are immortalised. This is because they fuse their souls, their tether to their mortal self, into their will, becoming one with their cultivated path.\n\nYet, this does not mean that the mage is truly free from death. To maintain their immortality, the mage must periodically absorb new insights and keep their soul from stagnating. Because what difference is there between an idle soul and a corpse? Those that fail to maintain a dynamic soul slowly cease to exist and disperse. The mage may also voluntarily Ascend, and immortalise their will into an artefact known as inheritance artefacts. Once they go through with that irreversible process, though, their soul and cultivation solidify and become eternal.\n\nKrish Nara was at that crossroads in his life. He had lived for over 2000 years and had personally witnessed the world move past him. Every year, he could feel his soul dimming by a smidgen as he failed to ignite a spark of inspiration. He knew that maybe in 5 more years, he would cease to exist.\n\nThus, after drowning his sorrows and regrets in strong alcohol, of which he had to consume multiple barrels due to his superior constitution as a Tesseract Transformation mage, he decided that it was time for him to Ascend.\n\n'Maybe my cultivation could be of use to someone else?' He thought.\n\nHis master before him had also Ascended and left him with a single cowrie shell, an inheritance artefact. In fact, his master had also suffered from the same problem as he himself was facing. Lack of stimulation!\n\nFortunately, his master found some stimulation in training a disciple and eked out an additional 1000 years in the process. Unfortunately, Krish was unable to benefit from this as he had thoroughly failed to find a suitable disciple in the last 1000 years.\n\nThat's right! He could not find a single suitable soul to carry forward his school's legacy in the last 10 mortal lifetimes.\n\nWith no other solution left, Krish decided to travel the world one last time by foot, like a mortal, and absorb the sights for one final time.\n\nThis was easier said than done because over the years he had overlooked the fact that he had a crippled right leg.\n\nOne must wonder: \"How can a Tesseract Transformation mage be a cripple?\"\n\nTrue. How could a being at the pinnacle of existence have such an idiotic deficiency? The answer to that was closely attached to Krish's cultivation method and unique skill that was derived from it.\n\nKrish Nara was the last student from an ancient school of cultivation called \"The Heavenly Eye\". The cultivation method did not offer any martial benefits, it was purely auxiliary. Yet, the potential it possessed trumped all the powers in the world. Because a cultivator of The Heavenly Eye had insight into one of the most elusive and abstract aspects in existence - Fortune!\n\nFortune, or luck, is a condition inherent to all things. Even non-sentient and inanimate objects have luck attached to them. Many may argue this, but The Heavenly Eye school affirm that the entire world is held together by this key metric. Once a mage is sufficiently advanced in The Heavenly Eye, they gain a special power that allows them to observe the fortune around them and predict future outcomes through extrapolation.\n\nOne can already imagine the sheer magnitude of such a power. To be able to predict the future! That is invariably the single most common wish of any mortal.\n\nHowever, the world is fair. Everything has a consequence, and so does the use of such a power. A person has a natural and predetermined trajectory in their life. If someone moves them off that trajectory after observing what lies ahead, they are interfering with the natural flow of time and they must bear the consequences. Yet, if they can offset the shift by taking something from the subject that creates a ripple of equal magnitude, then the balance can be restored.\n\nBack on Earth, this behaviour is known as karma offsetting.\n\nKrish learned of these consequences the hard way. When he started off, he still held connections to the mortal world in the form of his family. After using his powers to save his family from a few crises, he began to bear the scars of his actions, ergo his crippled right leg.\n\nThere is no way to treat these damages, no amount of elixirs or forbidden magic can alleviate them. Therefore, Krish was forced to limp his way around the world, like a common hobo. Quite literally! His appearance had solidified to resemble an old man with long facial hair following his breakthrough into Core Formation. It was another side-effect of his cultivation...\n\nThrough his travels, he'd been wearing the same set of clothes and had inevitably worn them down significantly. His entire ensemble truly had a wanderer's aura: with a long and uneven walking stick to support him and a worn-out sack sagging over his back.\n\nHis travels brought him to a village secluded in the Green-Sky Forests, and under the purview of one of the taller mountains in the Serrated-Peaks Mountain Range.\n\nIt was a quaint old place, Twilight Village it was called. To him though, it didn't appear any different from all the other villages he'd passed in his lifetime. Mortals going about their daily trivial lives: waking up, going to work, eating, sleeping, rinse, repeat.\n\nAfter glancing through his Heavenly Eyes, he observed that this particular place was shrouded in a greyish cloud. Danger lurked in the distant future. Nothing he'd have to worry about though - he'd be long gone by then.\n\n\"'scuse me, can I help ya?\" A local called out to him with an accented drawl.\n\n\"Good day! I'm a travelling soothsayer; is there a place of lodging in this village?\" Krish asked courteously.\n\nThe local scratched his head and narrowed his eyes with suspicion, \"A soothsayer...?\"\n\nHis vigilance was warranted, of course. Even though magic made a lot of impossible things possible, one could never be too cautious against conmen and huxters. Krish recognised this from looking at the local's eyes and added, \"I highly advise that you take greater care of your health in the upcoming days. Avoid unnecessary travels after dark, especially into the woods. Your pregnant wife will need a lot of support from you, after all.\"\n\nThe local's eyes widened in surprise, \"How... How did you-?\"\n\n\"Aren't you a lucky one! Twins - A son and a daughter!\" Krish didn't let the man finish his question. He rattled on with a monotonous tone, yet held a tranquil and inviting gaze.\n\n\"Great master!\" The local exclaimed and hopped over excitedly. \"The village doesn't have an inn, but there is an additional room at our house. My mother-in-law will be arriving in a few days though.\"\n\nKrish waved his hand and assuaged him, \"Don't worry. I'll be gone by then. You should probably remind your mother-in-law to bring in some of those seasonal fruits from their town. Nourishment is important for a pregnant woman.\"\n\nThe local nodded vigorously and carefully led the limping Krish towards his house. Along the way, a few of the neighbours called out and inquired about Krish, and the local respectfully introduced him to the villagers. The village was fairly small in size, and so the ambience was like a large family. Neighbours knew what was going on in other's houses, so it would have been impossible to hide Krish's existence.\n\nUnavoidably, Krish's identity as a soothsayer sparked a lot of interest from the crowd, which led to him fielding a range of questions.\n\n\"Great master, do you think my harvest this year will be good?\"\n\n\"Great master, my daughter is coming of age soon. Will I be able to find a nice husband for her?\"\n\n\"Great master.... I... ummm... My husband and I have been... trying regularly. But we aren't facing any... success...\"\n\nKrish was used to this. In fact, he was undertaking such an arduous trip for this very purpose. Over the last 1000 years, he found that he had become estranged from the mortal world. Having transcended the limits of his species, he had become numb to worldly affairs. This travel was his attempt to connect once again with his species before his passing.\n\n\"Everyone, please calm down. I will take a short rest and set up by the village centre. I can answer your questions at that time.\"\n\nThe crowd dispersed after Krish's assurance.\n\n____\n\nThe local was quick to act. After Krish had his rest, the man quickly prepared a desk and seat near the large tree at the village centre.\n\nKrish assumed his position and unloaded his tools from his sack. He first laid a clean mat over the table to protect his items, he then took out a few almanacks listing historic heavenly body states, and then he retrieved his container of cowrie shells.\n\nOnce he was ready, the villagers filed in one at a time.\n\nOne thing Krish found over his travels amongst average mortals, that is those without an obsession with power, was that their preoccupations seldom required him to exercise his cultivation.\n\nThe first person to meet him was a woman struggling to get pregnant. She had tried many folk alternatives to improve her chance, yet failed at all turns. To this, Krish didn't need to activate his powers. A cursory inspection with his magic provided more than enough information regarding her condition. He reached into his sack, which happened to be a space artefact, and pulled out a pot of herbs.\n\n\"Water this plant once every two days with exactly one cup of lukewarm water. After lunch, pluck one leaf and boil it in water and drink the concoction. Don't worry, there are a lot of kids in your future. You just need to be patient, and remain stressfree,\" Krish instructed calmly.\n\nThe woman burst into tears and held Krish's hands in gratitude, \"Thank you so much, great master. I'll try...\"\n\nHe patted the back of her palms and spoke in a gentle tone, \"It's your mother-in-law, isn't it?\"\n\nThe woman nodded along and explained her woes in great detail while sobbing. Krish was conscientious of this and had already set up a noise-cancelling barrier around them to occlude her voice.\n\nA large portion of the consultations he'd had to take on during his travels was like this. To most people, these problems appeared mundane, yet for these folk, they were monumental and insurmountable. Why? It was all because they had to suffer through it in silence, without support.\n\nFor this woman, overcoming her tyrannical mother-in-law was an impossible task. That stress in and of itself had eaten away at her psyche. How could she expect to get pregnant under such pressure? Even if she did, wouldn't she just damage her body further once she conceived?\n\nIn fact, the woman was already a week along into her pregnancy, she just didn't know it yet. Once she realised it, she would have regained her confidence, yet she would have ultimately accumulated a lot of emotional trauma through stress and would suffer in the future.\n\nKrish didn't need an all-seeing eye to predict her future. So his intervention right now, to help her vent and regain her frame of mind, wouldn't return to bite him back. However, the woman didn't skimp out in showing her gratitude. She gifted him with a basket of fruits as she left in a jolly manner.\n\nAfter she left, the next person in line walked in and unloaded his own problems.\n\nKrish happily went along with the set-up and met every single person in line. The villagers were grateful and respectful and didn't push their luck. Most of their questions could easily be solved through his inspection and a few deductions. Others, that required a bit of prediction could be determined through the use of his cowrie shells and by referencing his almanacks. Not once did Krish have to activate his Heavenly Eye.\n\nAt sunset, Krish stood up from his seat and walked back to his host's house. The man had reserved the room that was slightly detached from the house for him; it was supposed to be for his mother-in-law who was travelling in to support her pregnant daughter.\n\nAs a Tesseract Transformation realm mage, Krish didn't need sleep. As usual, he entered a deep meditative state and let time progress.\n\nHis meditation was interrupted by the sound of a rooster's crow, which indicated dawn break. Krish exhaled deeply and opened his eyes. Following his usual routine, he activated his Heavenly Eye and initiated his daily cultivation.\n\nUnexpectedly, the moment he looked through the Heavenly Eye, his eyes widened in shock and nearly popped out of their sockets. If not for the fact that his body didn't produce any waste, Krish feared he would have soiled his trousers too!\n\n\"What the heck just happened?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-063]]","n":0.021}}},{"i":157,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 061 - (Interlude) A Child's Eye","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n\"I'm sorry, Marie. But I can't tutor them anymore!\"\n\n\"Please, Miss. You're the only teacher in this village. You know just as well as I, the value of literacy in this world. Can you please do it for me, your oldest student?\" Marie Reva responded while enlarging her eyes to appear pitiful.\n\nThe aged woman before her sighed and responded, \"Look. It's not that I don't want to teach those twins. It's just that... How can I put this lightly... maybe the path of literacy isn't in their fates?\"\n\nMarie lowered her gaze dejectedly and turned towards the subjects of the discussion. Hiding behind her, were two fraternal twins, both of them at 6-years of age. Due to their young ages, they appeared as split images of each other; both had piercing blue eyes and curly brown hair. Yet, their distinctive characters separated them.\n\nThe boy guiltily slithered behind his bolder sister and shrunk his body. The girl puffed her chest and put on a brave and adamant front. She would appear cute, if not for the many bruises and scrapes along her arm and legs, as well as her dirtied clothes.\n\n\"Kano tries. He really does. I've seen him read the practice texts again and again, yet he faces difficulty each and every time. He ended up memorising the whole text in the end, but he still couldn't read it. Writing was even worse! Look at this page,\" the woman retrieved a scrap paper and displayed it in front of Marie.\n\n\"Here, look at this! He wrote the same letter in three different ways within the same sentence. I made him write it ten times as practice, and he corrected it. But when he had to write another word with those letters, it's the same story all over again!\"\n\n\"And he barely talks! How can he get rid of his stutter if he doesn't talk out loud? He murmurs all the time, and his sister has to broadcast it for him.\"\n\nWith an exasperated grunt, the woman continued, \"Don't get me started with Dora! That girl can't focus, at all! Look at her!\"\n\nThe woman pointed at the culprit, who was crouching down and playing with a few ants crawling in front of her. The girl jolted her head in attention and retorted, \"It's not my fault!\" She exclaimed without thought.\n\n\"See? She doesn't even know what we were talking about. What's worse is that she doesn't think twice before going up in arms. Sometimes I can't tell if she's a boy or a girl!\"\n\n\"I didn't do it for no reason!\" The little girl explained. \"They were making fun of Kano. I couldn't just do nothing!\"\n\n\"Girl! It's his fight, he must handle it. If you're always the one to bail him out, how can he grow?\" The woman retaliated.\n\n\"But...\" yet before Dora could respond, Marie grasped her by her shoulders and gently applied pressure. Dora took the hint and kept mum.\n\n\"Is there really no other way?\" Marie pleaded once again.\n\n\"No. There are so many other kids in this village depending on me to teach them. I can't afford to give them special attention. Besides, I'm doubtful whether it will even work,\" The woman resolutely denied Marie. \"I think they might find more success in pursuing different avenues. Now please leave! Gramie said that there's a powerful travelling soothsayer set-up near the village centre!\"\n\nMarie sighed and left. She grasped the hands of both the kids and left the woman's house, which also worked as a makeshift school in Twilight Village.\n\nAs the trio walked back to the orphanage, Dora spoke up in a quiet voice, \"Sis, I'm sorry.\"\n\nMarie patted the girls head and consoled her with a firm tone, \"Don't apologise! You did the right thing. No one messes with our family! I would've given those brats a few hits myself if you hadn't.\"\n\nThe little girl chuckled in response, but this only sent the boy into a deeper spiral, \"It's all m-m-my fault.\"\n\nBefore Marie could say anything, the boy rubbed his teary eyes and rushed up the stairs leading to the orphanage.\n\n\"Sigh. This kid... I should let the matron know...\" Marie muttered to herself.\n\n\"Sis, when do you think big bro Markus will come back? I really miss him,\" Dora asked.\n\n\"He just left a few months ago, right? We have to be patient, Dora. He's trying to follow his dream, and we should support him. If I'm being honest, I'm actually a little jealous of that brat. I wish I could become a mage,\" Marie replied.\n\n\"Why don't you?\"\n\n\"Are you kidding? I'm so old!\"\n\nThe Dora counted something out in her little fingers and spoke up, \"But you're only... two years older than him.\"\n\nMarie responded with a factual and sorrowful tone, \"They say that the older you are when you start learning magic, the harder it becomes to advance. Markus was at the right age, I missed my chance. It would have been a waste of money if I-\"\n\n\"Are you leaving us again?\" Dora interrupted Marie with another question.\n\n\"Huh? Yes. I'm planning to take another trip. The Maynard's Merchant Caravan offered me a finance manager's position for their upcoming lap. This one is much longer than the last job - a year.\"\n\n\"You're going to be gone for so long?\" Dora exclaimed with a pout.\n\n\"Now, now! We barely managed to cover Markus' admission. What about the upcoming fees? I have to do this,\" Marie instructed right as they arrived at the orphanage. She then squatted in front of Dora and continued, \"I need you to be more vigilant! It will just be you, your brother and the matron. Don't trouble her too much, OK?\"\n\nDora nodded obediently. Marie smiled and added, \"Now, let me go find you brother...\" while walking away.\n\nDora waited until Marie was out of her line of sight and then swivelled her head in place cautiously. Once she made sure that no one was around, she tip-toed towards the woods behind the orphanage while carefully holding her bag.\n\nShe travelled deeper until she arrived at a clearing. Like a bountiful oasis in the middle of a desert, the clearing stood out like a sore thumb amidst the dark and towering forestry. There was a single tree in the middle of a pleasant and bright-green coat of grass dotted with a plethora of colourful flowers and herbs.\n\nUnlike the other trees in the forest, this one was special. For those with trypophobia, the sight of its trunk, which was decorated with irregularly sized holes, would induce severe aversion and disgust. In fact, the trunk itself was hollow.\n\nDora skipped up to the tree and called out, \"Fancy!\"\n\nThrough one of the holes on the tree, an elegant insect, with a thorax the size of an adult palm, gracefully fluttered out. The insect, Fancy, looked much like the swallowtail butterflies from Earth, except the pattern on its wings were more colourful, intricate and fluid.\n\nFancy skipped through the air, like a leaf in the wind, and landed in front of Dora.\n\n\"Look what I brought!\" Dora started and carefully reached into her back. She retrieved a large box from with and placed that on the ground. She reached in and pulled out a flower with large orange petals, with its roots intact.\n\n\"I found this today near the village, and it reminded me of you,\" She used her hands to dig into the soil and proceeded to plant the flower.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe what happened today. Durkas called Kano an idiot in front of everyone, just because he couldn't read a paragraph out loud. I was so angry that I nearly picked up my bag and threw it at him. But then I remembered that I had the flower inside. So, I took Kano's bag and threw it at him. But who knew that Kano had a bottle of ink inside it? The bottle blew up when the bag hit Durkas and he was completely covered in black!\" Dora chortled out loud as she carefully tapped the dirt around the flower's stem.\n\n\"There, done!\" She then inched back and looked at Fancy expectantly. \"Do you like it?\"\n\nFancy fluttered her wings as if expressing an affirmation and fluttered over the flower. As she moved, a fine powder sprinkled from her wings around the flower. As the powder settled, the flower started to bloom brighter as if it was injected with a direct dose of vitality.\n\nDora clapped her hands and then lay down in front of the flower on her stomach. She supported her head on her hands while taking a deep breath.\n\n\"Haaa. Marie is leaving in a few days. Soon it's just gonna be me and Kano, all alone. Just like before...\"\n\nFancy landed on another flower next to Dora. Surprisingly, the flower didn't bend under her weight.\n\n\"I miss Markus. You know big bro Markus, right? He went to Radiant City to become a mage. Do you know any mages?\" Dora gazed at Fancy, expecting an answer.\n\n\"That so? Why do they attack you on sight?\"\n\n\"I guess... Then do you know any strong beasts in the forest? Markus said that he wants to become a mage to protect us. Here's what I'm thinking. What if we become friends with some strong beasts in the forest? They could protect everyone at the orphanage, and the Markus wouldn't need to leave?\"\n\n\"What do you mean they're dangerous?\"\n\nDora scrunched her face in disgust, \"Ewwww! That's disgusting! Wait a minute, why haven't I seen any monsters around here?\"\n\n\"What's mana scarcity?\"\n\n\"But I remember you saying that there was an overabundance of mana in this clearing. Shouldn't this attract more monsters?\"\n\n\"Woah! You're that strong?\"\n\nDora giggled and continued talking to Fancy.\n\nAs the sun started to set, Dora bid Fancy farewell and skipped out of the clearing. Once she exited the boundary, the area began to flicker as a fog of power rose up from the soil. As the fog thickened, the scenery changed to match the rest of the forest. It was almost as if the peaceful and tranquil clearing never existed.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-062]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":158,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 060 - Change of Scenery","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\"It seems that I can no longer work as a teacher in this world,\" Guy lamented as he cautiously plopped down on the bed in his room.\n\nHe had only just used his magic to expel the dust that was caked on all the furniture in the room. Unwittingly, he had collapsed a few of them in the process as they were on their last limbs.\n\n(You could try again in another state?) Mast suggested with some uncertainty.\n\n'That won't work. I've been blacklisted! Even if I occlude by identity, they'll figure it out sooner or later and then I'll have to face the music for it,' Guy responded while shaking his head.\n\n'I guess I'll have to find employment somewhere else,' Guy posited. 'There's always The Burning Forge!'\n\nGuy slowly lay down on the mattress and pondered on the idea, 'Karmin did offer me a job the last time. Maybe I could work towards becoming an enchanter for his business. I'll have to redeem my Smithing Practitioner's License and apply for the Enchanting path, but that's okay! I have all the time in the world, after all.'\n\n(Are you going to be content with that?) Mast interrupted Guy's \"ambitious\" plans.\n\n'Why wouldn't I?' Guy retorted.\n\n(I thought that you wanted to continue in the teaching profession...)\n\n'Well...' Guy dragged the syllable with some longing hidden in his tone. 'It's fine. On the bright side, enchanting is a lucrative occupation. To top it all off, I don't have to worry about money now, seeing as I have a crapload of it in the bank already!'\n\nGuy quickly changed the topic of discussion with a segue, 'Speaking of money, I can't believe I have to stay in such a decrepit place even though I'm filthy rich! It doesn't make any sense!'\n\nIn actuality, Guy didn't have much of a choice. All the available inns, motels and temporary housing establishments were booked in Radiant City. The scarcity of lodging stretched out even towards the nearest village. Guy was actually quite lucky to have found a place to stay within the city.\n\nThe reason for this could be attributed to the ongoing Beast Taming Guild's 2-star assessment.\n\nUnlike with most other guild assessments, Beast Taming required heavier preparations, in readying the specific beasts for the process and isolating the environment to standardise the testing conditions.\n\nA lot of these behind-the-scenes arrangements took significant effort and thus restricted the frequency as well as the ubiquity of the assessment.\n\nWhile most other assessments could be undertaken in any guild branch around the world, the higher starred tests for the Beast Taming guild could only occur in specific branches. In Radiant City, it only took place once every three years.\n\nSo it wasn't technically out of the blue that all available lodging was occupied by foreigners and visitors, as nearly all of them were preoccupied with the ongoing assessment. It was only unfortunate that Guy happened to be homeless at an inopportune moment.\n\nGuy sighed once again, 'I've contacted a broker to find a room up for rent. Hopefully, he'll come back with some offers tomorrow.'\n\nAs Guy made plans for the next day, a series of knocks from his room door interrupted his thoughts.\n\n'Who could it be?' Guy cautiously approached the door and pressed his ears against the surface. He knew that this locale was rife with crime, as he was nearly assaulted on two different occasions while approaching this inn.\n\nWith some difficulty, Guy was only able to make out the sound of someone panting. Clearly, the person on the other side was exhausted, and impatient because another set of knocks followed not long after.\n\nGuy opened the door by a crack and peered through the aperture.\n\n\"Master!\" A familiar voice called out from the other side.\n\n\"Markus? What are you doing here?\"\n\nMarkus pushed open the door and rushed inside the room, panting heavily. He was wearing a burly backpack that bulged out as if it were stuffed full.\n\n\"Did you know how difficult it was to find you, Master?\" Markus exclaimed with a wronged expression.\n\nHe then swivelled his head around and observed his surroundings. This entire time, he'd been focusing intensely on following a trail of breadcrumbs left by his Master and had finally found his temporary domicile. As he trudged through the grimy streets of this district, Markus' heart ached in distress.\n\n'Master has been forced into such an awful state. He's without a job and savings. On top of that, he had to spend a fortune in purchasing that potion for me.'\n\nHis resolve only grew stronger after that. And the near ramshackle state of the room cemented it in place.\n\nGuy stared at the spectacle before him in disbelief. \"What are you doing here? And what's with the massive luggage?\"\n\nMarkus shook his head and wore a serious expression. \"Master, I've dropped out of the Academy. I'm leaving with you!\"\n\n\"You did what?!\" Guy screamed in shock.\n\n\"If the Academy isn't having you, then I don't want to study there,\" Markus declared.\n\nGuy massaged his forehead and plopped down onto a chair. \"You... I've told you many times to be so impulsive when making life-changing decisions. And why are you still calling me Master?\"\n\nMarkus dropped his bag and fished into it in search of something. He pulled out an envelope and returned it to Guy. \"I haven't read what's inside, therefore I don't agree with anything that may or may not have been conveyed through it.\"\n\nGuy stared blankly at the blatantly resealed envelope in his hand and chuckled wryly, \"Markus... I'm doing this-\"\n\n\"I don't agree!\" Markus declared and interrupted Guy.\n\nGuy sighed audibly and leaned back into the chair.\n\n\"Markus. You yourself told me that your siblings back at the orphanage were the ones that supported you and got you into the Academy. If you do this, you'd be letting them down,\" He reminded Markus.\n\n\"I... Since the day I became your disciple, my future was sealed. My place is to be next to you, Master. Where you go, I'll go!\"\n\nGuy scratched his forehead in irritation and retorted, \"Where CAN we go? Have you thought about that?\"\n\nUpon hearing that, Markus was stumped.\n\n'That's right!' His Master didn't have any money to his name, nor did he have any strong backing. He was unemployed and had no prospects for the future.\n\n'What to do?' Markus contemplated possible solutions.\n\nWhile he was doing so, Guy had begun reevaluating his plans. 'It doesn't look like Markus will change his mind. But he's still a child and needs to be properly educated. Maybe I can enrol him into a vocational school, or another non-magical educational institution. I know that civil positions are generally stable and well-paying.'\n\nGuy wasn't worried about money, nor was he concerned about backing. He had both, thanks to Karmin. Guy could essentially retire right now and still live a content life!\n\nWhile the Master was worrying about his Disciple's future, the Disciple came up with a solution, \"Master! Why don't you come with me?\"\n\n\"Come with you, where?\"\n\n\"Back to my village. You can wind down and relax there while you search for a new job. Besides, I know that a lot of merchant caravans pass through the village near ours. You could even work as a teacher there!\" Markus rattled on enthusiastically.\n\n\"On top of that, the Matron will also appreciate an additional helping hand. You wouldn't have to pay excessive rent either.\"\n\nGuy was stumped by Markus' elated ravings.\n\n'Why would I live in a village if I can rent a house in the city?' He thought. He didn't quite understand Markus' line of reasoning in suggesting that.\n\n'Wait a minute. He doesn't know that I'm loaded!' He realised that he hadn't disclosed his relationship with Karmin Zola to Markus yet. No wonder the boy was so distressed about him.\n\nGuy wanted to explain to Markus that everything was fine, and to not worry about the future. But then he held his tongue in the last minute.\n\n'Maybe...' He thought. His life would be set if he decided to remain in the city and pursued a career as an enchanter. There wouldn't be any surprises, and he could earn and live comfortably.\n\n'That... doesn't sound like fun.' Guy felt that chasing such a life, while safe, was exceedingly lonely and boring.\n\n'This is my second chance, damn it! Why should I tie myself in one place when I have a whole world to explore?'\n\nGuy smiled contentedly and responded, \"Sure. Let's do that!\"\n\nMarkus responded with an even brighter smile, free of burden and shame.\n\nHis biggest woe was that he felt responsible for his Master's current predicament. His reasoning behind this suggestion was that he wanted to make it up to his Master in any way possible. This could only be achieved if he remained close to his Master.\n\n____\n\nA few days later, Guy and Markus departed from Radiant City in high spirits. Markus voluntarily took on the responsibility of the preparations and travel itinerary.\n\nSince the boy was still blind to his Master's financial endowment, he devised the travel in a way as to minimise expenditure.\n\nThrough some investigation, he found a merchant's caravan that was set to pass through a village close to his own. He intended to hitchhike a ride from that village to the orphanage.\n\nGuy didn't know why Markus was so excited about the travel plans. In the end, he just shrugged it off and decided to roll with the flow.\n\n____\n\n\"Good lord, my butt hurts!\" Guy cried as he massaged his rear end.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Master. That was the most affordable ride I could find,\" Markus said apologetically.\n\nGuy groaned while stretching his body, \"Oh my back! I feel like I've aged by a decade in the last week itself.\"\n\nHe patted Markus' slumped shoulders and added, \"Don't worry about the money, Markus. It's not worth losing your vitality if we're only saving a few coins.\"\n\nMarkus nodded in embarrassment and walked forward, \"It's this way!\"\n\nThe duo trudged along for an hour along an uneven and unkempt path, that wound through the dense shrubbery. The trek reminded Guy of his experiences back on Earth. This wasn't his first time hiking through forests to get to a village. Back on Earth, many villages he'd been to were still isolated from sprawling civilisation.\n\nThe path they were on veered in the direction of the Serrated-Peaks Mountain Range, towards its northern section. It was a geological feature that neighboured Radiant City and was made of towering and interconnected mountains, with its highest peaks at the ends of the mountain range.\n\nThe mountain range formed a crescent moon arcing from the north of Radiant City and extended to the southeast. The forest actually extended from within the arc to without, however, they were labelled with two different names. The inner forest was known as the Green-Sky Forest and the woods on the other side were called the Whispering-Trees Forest. A small opening in the mountain range, right at its centre, acted as a throughway and was a prosperous trade route.\n\nTheir destination was a village at the northern end of the mountain range. While the mountain the village was next to towered the highest, the forestry next to it was less dense. Furthermore, a small spring, originating from the mountain range, flowed near the village and into the denser forests.\n\nGuy thought they would following the path which curved away from the large mountain and into the village centre, yet a narrower pathway moved towards the mountain at an upwards gradient. Markus took the narrower path and explained, \"Our village is called the Twilight Village, because when the sun rises, the mountain range covers it well and makes it look like its still twilight when its well into the morning.\"\n\n\"Our orphanage is right up this path. There are steps carved into the mountain that lead into our orphanage from our village, however, for that you'd have to go into the village centre first. Besides, going up an incline is much easier than walking up steps.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes, Guy beheld the orphanage Markus was gushing about. It had a respectable look, much like a courtyard dwelling from the villages. It was built on a small, flat expanse on the sloping mountainside. And just as Markus had told him, there were steps leading down into the village right next to the orphanage.\n\nGuy approached the sign in front of the orphanage and read it out loud, \"Mount Tai Orphanage?\"\n\nMarkus walked up to Guy and clarified, \"Our Matron came up with the name. It's named after the mountain.\"\n\nGuy turned and faced the majestic peak leading up from the orphanage and sighed loudly, \"Right... I had eyes, but couldn't recognise it...\"\n\n\"Markus? Is that you?\" Guy heard a pleasant, yet somehow familiar voice emanating from within the dwelling.\n\nWith furrowed brows, he turned towards the sound, and his eyes burst open in shock.\n\n\"It's... you?!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-061]]","n":0.022}}},{"i":159,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 059 - Defeat","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nMarkus woke up from his coma groggily.\n\n\"What... happened?\" He uttered with difficulty.\n\n\"Boss!\" Four familiar voices greeted him loudly. Markus supported himself and sat up against the bed's backboard.\n\n\"Where am I?\"\n\n\"You're in the infirmary, Boss!\"\n\n\"Take it easy. I'll go call the nurse.\"\n\nMarkus rubbed his eyes and looked around. After localising himself, he realised that he was currently in the Academy's infirmary. This wasn't his first time here after all - the four individuals next to him had sent him here one too many times before...\n\nAfter stabilising himself, Markus evaluated his condition.\n\n'Wow! I'm... perfectly fine?' He was a little confused. He clearly remembered breaking many bones and injuring a lot of his internal organs.\n\nA realisation struck him, causing him to panic. \"How long was I out for?\"\n\nOne of the F4 shrugged and answered, \"Barely four hours.\"\n\n\"But...\" Markus inspected himself once again in incredulity.\n\n\"Don't worry, Boss. The nurse said that thanks to the Vitality and Regeneration Potion, all of the damage was attended to immediately. There is no after-effect or long-lasting damage done!\" The boy said while flashing a smile and a thumbs-up.\n\n\"A Vitality and Regeneration Potion?\" Markus was dumbfounded. He knew for a fact that the particular potion was extremely expensive in the market as it was able to completely regenerate any damage done to the body regardless of its severity. It was often advertised as being able to even regenerate limbs!\n\nAfter perusing through his memory with some difficulty, Markus vaguely remembered being fed a liquid right as he lost his consciousness after the fight.\n\n\"Was it Master?\" He muttered. The thought caused Markus to tear up involuntarily.\n\n'Master spent so much money, just for me!' He quickly dabbed up the tears threatening to burst forth and centred himself.\n\n\"Oh right! Almost forgot,\" one of the F4 opened the drawers at Markus' bedside and pulled out a letter. \"Teacher Way told us to give you this letter when you woke up. He came over to recruit you half an hour ago, but since you were still in a coma, he left this with us. Not only that, but a few other teachers also stopped by to check on your condition. I think they're also planning to take you under them!\"\n\nAnother member of the F4 spoke with excitement, \"You're so lucky! Did you know, Teacher Way was automatically promoted from apprentice to teacher after the match? Apparently, it was already in the works and the Headmaster was waiting until there was a guarantee that he would pass the apprentice tournament. He even got a bigger office and a bunch of additional resource allocations...\"\n\nMarkus shook his head and interrupted the boys before they started their own tirade, \"Right! Where's Mas- I mean Teaching Apprentice Larks?\"\n\nThe four boys stared at each other in confusion, \"Who?\"\n\nMarkus gritted his teeth and spoke up with irritation oozing in his voice, \"The person who brought me here!\"\n\nThe four were intimidated by Markus' sudden change in temperament and scratched their heads in unison in recollection.\n\n\"Oh, I remember! The man who brought you here left a letter with us before he left. Where was it again?\"\n\nThey began to look around until one of them reached into the trash can and fished out a crumpled envelope.\n\nHe bit his tongue in apology and handed it to Markus, \"He didn't look like much so we thought he was being presumptuous by scouting you, Boss...\"\n\nMarkus snatched the envelope and screamed, \"GET OUT! NOW!\"\n\nThe four scrambled out in fear. Markus didn't notice this, but his standing in their hearts had risen by miles. Before, they respected him for his superior intellect as well as his ingenuity. But after they saw him stand toe to toe with a monster like Gaige, and nearly win, they began to worship Markus.\n\nMarkus carefully flattened the envelope and opened it up.\n\nAs he read the contents of the letter, his eyes reddened and his eyebrows furrowed in distress.\n\n____\n\nDear Markus,\n\nI'm sorry that I had to leave you like this, but I couldn't bear to part with you face-to-face.\n\nI am so proud of you, Markus! Teaching you has been the greatest pleasure of my life, and I will always cherish that memory.\n\nWhen I saw you perform in the arena, I was so impressed by how far you had reached since we first met. But I wasn't surprised. I always knew you had a lot of potential and would amount to something great. I want you to always remember that! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nAnd don't fret about the loss. It wasn't your fault. You performed beyond my expectations, and I am extremely proud of your accomplishment. Sometimes in life, you are forced to face inevitabilities that you can do nothing about. Your opponent today happened to be one. No matter how much you prepared for this confrontation, I don't think you could have predicted the match to go the way it did. Such is life.\n\nSo, treat this as a learning opportunity for the future, and don't get hung up on the defeat. Your main focus should be to improve yourself and push yourself beyond your limits. If you get engrossed in trying to compete against others and going against the inevitabilities that are blocking your way, your obsession will only eat you alive. Remember, magic cannot solve all your life's problems.\n\nUnfortunately, I can no longer continue as your teacher. I cannot stress this enough, but this isn't your fault. Don't think that you are responsible for my unemployment! I never placed that burden on your shoulders. What transpired was an inevitability in my life, and there was nothing you could have done about it.\n\nWorry not, I've already discussed with Teacher Jeeves about taking you in as his student, and he agreed. Don't misunderstand, this wasn't because I didn't believe that you would win. It's just that there are many factors involved and luck is rarely on my side. I just couldn't bear leaving you out to dry without any backup should the worst-case scenario transpire.\n\nFinally, it is time to address the elephant in the room. I know you consider me as your Master. However, I am not confident that I can support you and nurture you to the level you deserve. When I accepted you as my disciple, I was pretty excited. I was looking forward to working with you and growing together. But I realise that I was being selfish. I had no right, nor did I have the qualification, to become your Master. So, from here on, I step down as your Master. You deserve better!\n\nGood luck! I am looking forward to the many achievements in your future.\n\nYour loving friend,\n\nGuy Larks\n\n____\n\nMarkus lowered the letter and covered his face with his sleeves. His emotions were erupting uncontrollably; like the opening of floodgates after a heavy storm, he began bawling.\n\nIn truth, no matter how much Guy tried to dissuade him, Markus subconsciously felt responsible for Guy's dismissal.\n\n'If only I had pushed harder instead of holding back my attacks.'\n\n'If only I had prepared additional ingredients with greater power.'\n\n'If only...'\n\nHe exhausted himself by formulating a list of regrets - errors that he could have avoided or alleviated in order to win his match.\n\nAlas, they would remain hypothetical. He had screwed it all up, and he hated himself for it!\n\nHe whimpered and wailed, screamed and flailed. His emotions had completely overpowered his body - he was unable to contain himself.\n\n\"Master...\" he sighed through his sadness.\n\nFor Markus, the previous year had been the highlight of his entire life. He had never felt happier, or more satisfied. For once in his life, he didn't feel worthless.\n\nAll of it was thanks to his Master, Guy Larks. His Master had helped him achieve something that was deemed impossible by everyone in this world. His Master had guided him and raised him in record time. His Master had placed his entire career on the line, for Markus' sake. Yet, Markus took that trust and squandered it!\n\nSlowly, Markus' self-deprecation overpowered his psyche and threatened to pull him back into the well Guy had tried so hard to pull him out of.\n\nBut before Markus lost himself into the darkness, a corporeal string of light brightened and attached to him. It wasn't a metaphorical string, a literal string of light fastened itself on Markus' nascent cultivation and extended out into the world. It extended through the open infirmary windows and moved towards the city.\n\nIt passed through the commercial district, weaving through the crowd and buildings. It extended towards the dankest corner of the city, a place for the low-class folk.\n\nThe area was near the outskirts of Radiant City and was filled with aged housing. The string zig-zagged through the area and approached a run-down inn near the centre of this district.\n\nThe string extended through the window of an inn, and finally stopped. Abruptly, the slack string tightened and became taut. \n\nWhat was weird about this connection was that it somehow felt as if it was already in existence. As if both sides of the string were already tethered in place, yet the string hadn't fully solidified. But now, it gained visibility due to a hitherto unknown condition being met.\n\nBack at the infirmary, Markus suddenly reached an epiphany. His gaze sharpened, and his expression darkened. He picked up the letter written by his Master and carefully folded it back into the envelope. He then picked up the letter from Jo Way, crumpled it and tossed it into the trash. He cleaned himself up and rushed out of the infirmary door with a firm resolve.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-060]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":160,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 058 - Apprentice Tournament (Part Three)","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nGuy Larks cursed his bad luck the moment the referee declared the match-up.\n\n'I'm up against Jo Way, right off the bat? Why?'\n\nNo matter how hard Guy tried to distance himself from the agent of misfortune, he'd always end up getting drawn into the man's path of destruction.\n\n'It's as if the whole world is revolving around him!'\n\n(It's all a coincidence...) Mast would often reiterate in his mind.\n\n'I'd agree with you if it was the one time. But this? This whole thing reeks, I tell ya!'\n\n(But it really is a coincidence...)\n\nAnyways, Guy wasn't optimistic about the match-up. In all his experience reading those formulaic web novels from his old world, not once had a native from the world triumphed over a transmigrator. Even if there was a victory, they'd end up losing out miserably in the long run.\n\nGuy didn't overlook the fact that he too was a foreigner in this world.\n\n'I'm only a transmigrator in name. I don't have any boosts or cheats like Jo Way,' Guy sighed frequently.\n\n(Again with you and your cheats!)\n\nMany times, Guy had reassessed his decision to work as a teacher of magic because, in a lot of ways, this occupation was antithetical to his beliefs. Take this match for example! Introducing tweens to violence and subjecting them to pain at such an early age was a recipe for creating emotionless monsters.\n\nBecause of that, Guy had spent a lot of time grooming Markus and appealing to his humanity. Guy didn't want him to become a psychopathic murder-hobo who would unleash his rage on all those that fronted him in the past.\n\nSeemingly, Guy's teachings had been effective, because Markus was exceedingly careful in his confrontation against Gaige.\n\nGuy knew for a fact that Markus was nerfing his spellcasting lethality. He could have very easily overpowered Gaige and maimed him, but he chose not to do that. Markus even repeatedly urged Gaige to surrender because he was averse to inflicting unnecessary pain on his peer.\n\nWas it admirable, or foolish? Was it brave, or cowardly? Guy couldn't be the judge of that.\n\nIn all honesty, Guy would have done the same thing if he was in Markus' shoes. He couldn't just flip a switch in his head and accept the fact that he had to hurt someone so excessively.\n\nBut his contemplation came to a sudden halt when Gaige unleashed a roar filled with an aura of intense suppression. It was at that moment that Guy nearly overturned his entire outlook on life and concluded that, 'Yep! Markus should have finished him when he had the chance...'\n\nMarkus pushed Gaige to the edge. He suppressed him with his superior skills and spellcasting, and sent him into a pit of despair. Gaige was on the verge of defeat. But someone with a template of the MC wouldn't succumb to such as outcome so easily.\n\nAs Gaige's roar resonated, a blanket of darkness emanated from him and covered the entire arena. The white in Gaige's eyes turned pure and marbly, while the bluish hue in his pupils deepened in colour. His blistering skin started to peel off as scales black as the abyss burst out and covered his torso and lower body. The scales encroached into and enveloped his appendages, revealing sharp and stark-black claws.\n\nThe scales reached up to his chin and halted their progression. Instead, his canines elongated by a few centimetres.\n\nGuy gaped in disbelief as he heard Jo Way's hushed explanation of what transpired, \"Perfected resonance? That's just great...\"\n\nMortals in the Late stage of Mana Condensation realms are technically able to advance into the Foundation Establishment realm. However, most don't do it straight away. This is because they wait to achieve what is known as perfected resonance. This is a state achieved by mortals that have perfectly assimilated the fundamentals of their cultivation method and have reached the optimal point to lay their foundations into the path of magehood. For many, this may take years after achieving Late stage Mana Condensation. Generally, if a mortal human is unable to achieve perfected resonance before they reach their 30s, they resolve to just advance without it at the cost of not being able to advance any further.\n\nMany criteria contribute to achieving perfected resonance. Ultimately, it all relies on the mortal's accumulation of pertinent insights into themselves and their cultivation. Having a Specialised cultivation method definitely helps in that regard. For Gaige, he managed to achieve perfected resonance after he understood the true power that lay within his bloodline. And what was his special bloodline?\n\nIt was the Abyssal Wyrm!\n\nGuy had read about it in a book owned by Al Jeeves. The Abyssal Wyrm was a remnant from before the Age of Isolation. The reptilian species known as the Draconids were endemic to the Fel realm, known for their immense power and strong affinity to mana.\n\nDuring the times were the realms were connected, many Draconid species migrated from the Fel realm in search of unconquered lands. The Wyrm were a class of Draconids that were known for their snake-like appearance. They lacked appendages but had a lengthy body with immense strength. Wyrms were parametrically the largest species of Draconids in existence.\n\nThe Abyssal Wyrm was the strongest subspecies of its kind. Its strength came from its inherent affinity to a very rare kind of mana - darkness. Many mages had tried to build an affinity to this mana, and only a few had succeeded. Those that failed suffered death so brutal, that it discouraged others from following in their footsteps.\n\nThe blanket of darkness unleashed its power immediately after it stabilised. Markus quickly collapsed into a prone position, as if the weight of the entire world was dumped on him.\n\nMarkus raised his wand and cast a spell through familiarity. However, the fire that burst out from the spell circle was sucked into the blanket of darkness, leaving no trace.\n\nGaige remained stationary in his original position, but he directed his gaze on Markus and roared harder. In response, the pressure on Markus intensified. He found it harder to breathe.\n\nSlowly, he found that he could no longer raise his arms or legs.\n\nGuy started to fidget in place. He wanted to throw in the towel on behalf of Markus, but he held himself back with great difficulty. He couldn't make that move and demotivate Markus. This was a fight Markus had to overcome by himself, and Guy couldn't interfere no matter how much his conscience screamed for him to do so.\n\nThe referee observed the fight with unwavering focus. He couldn't afford to make any mistakes, lest a student loses their life during his watch...\n\nHe trained his attention on Markus and observed for an opportunity to intervene.\n\nMarkus didn't let out! He gritted his teeth and held on to dear life.\n\n'Can't lose...' He repeated in his mind. If he gave up now, then he will have ruined his Master's only chance to become a teacher!\n\nMarkus' lungs begin to collapse under the increasing pressure. But Markus was unwilling to let out. He measured his breath and tried his hardest to maintain consciousness.\n\n'Any... second! He can't maintain this enraged state for long,' he surmised.\n\nAnd true to his assumptions, the blanket started to recede into Gaige - he had run out of steam.\n\nGaige wheezed as he tried to maintain his position; he was so exhausted that a light breeze could topple him. His scales and deformations started to recede as well, however, his chest and torso remained the same.\n\nMarkus pressed his hand against the floor and tried to raise himself. His right hand grasped the wand and began to materialise a spell circle.\n\nGaige's eyes widened in shock, 'This is it...'\n\nAs he braced himself for an attack, he suddenly heard a loud thud.\n\nHe squinted and looked ahead, only to see the slumped body of his opponent - unconscious.\n\n\"The victory goes to Number 32!\" The referee exclaimed.\n\nRight as his voice pierced through the silence, Guy rushed on stage and carefully turned Markus and lay him on his back. He then raised the boy's head and poured a potion into his mouth. After he made sure that the potion was consumed, he picked the boy in his arms and rushed off stage.\n\n\"I won...\" Gaige muttered in elation. \"I WON!\" He screamed with gusto.\n\nThe audience didn't chime in with cheers, though. They were still shellshocked by the events that transpired.\n\n\"You did it! Good job!\" Jo Way praised as he rushed over and supported the weak Gaige. \"Let's get you fixed up, hmm?\"\n\n\"I did it, teacher! We did it!\" The boy muttered in a low voice as he trailed along while slumped onto Jo Way's shoulders.\n\nWei Zao smiled at Gaige's face, but when the boy diverted his attention, the smile regressed into a thoughtful frown.\n\nMany details stood out and gnawed at Wei Zao during the match.\n\nGaige's cultivation with the Insight into the Abyss had tailored his body to match the Abyssal Wyrm as closely as possible. This allowed the boy to uncover the truths of the bloodline and had managed to achieve perfected resonance. The fact that Gaige had achieved it so early - at the age of 13 - was both a boon and a curse for Wei Zao. Gaige definitely wasn't an outlier; many other extraordinary talents had managed to achieve perfected resonance near his current age. However, many powerful sects, clans, organisations and empires collected such extraordinary talents at all costs. If word got out, he'd have to contest with these powerhouses to keep Gaige. With his own strength being only at the Base stage of Foundation Establishment, his chances weren't promising. \n\nBut that wasn't Wei Zao's biggest concern.\n\n\"Unknown cultivation method?\" Wei Zao muttered in disbelief. This was the first time that his Omniscient Library had thrown such a value at him.\n\nFurthermore, it even failed to discern the spells that were cast by Markus. Not even a hint!\n\nThis automatically triggered red flags in Wei Zao's head. If his system, which labelled itself as omniscient, had gaps in its knowledge, then there were definitely higher powers at work.\n\nHe realised that he had been a bit too lax by placing his complete trust in the system. He was simply a pawn in the games played by those that managed these infinite worlds. Maybe, the system was a tag placed on him to keep him under their control.\n\n'Is Markus also a transmigrated soul?' Wei Zao asked his system with some suspicion.\n\nAnnoyingly enough, he was received by silence, {...}\n\n'Stupid system!' He cursed. After a moment of contemplation, he formulated a plan.\n\n\"There's only one way to get to the bottom of this!\" He had to probe directly at the source - Markus Reva!\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-059]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":161,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 057 - Apprentice Tournament (Part Two)","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nThe moment the referee signalled the start of the match, Gaige slashed his sword and projected a wave of fire. The wave propagated vigorously and threatened to envelop Markus.\n\nIn response, Markus waved his wand and summoned a spell circle. The flames approaching him collided against an opposition of air and was summarily extinguished.\n\nGaige used the wave as a distraction to cover the distance between himself and Markus. Unfortunately, he never expected Markus to dissipate the flames so quickly. He was three leaps away when the flames cleared. Markus waved his wand once again and summoned another spell circle.\n\nGaige had never seen such a spell before; the circle appeared much, much simpler in design, yet it also had an indescribable intricacy to it.\n\nHis instincts blared in earnest as the spell approached completion. Gaige quickly halted his momentum and dodged backwards. It was a good thing that he did because a mini-explosion bloomed in the place he was supposed to be.\n\nA bead of sweat dripped down his back as he processed the turn of events.\n\n\"What was that spell?\" His thoughts were voiced by the audience.\n\n\"I've... never seen that before. It has to be some kind of a finishing spell, right?\" A student chimed in.\n\nWei Zao furrowed his brows. He had never seen that spell before either. Even after using his vast accumulation of knowledge, he wasn't able to pinpoint its origin. He then concentrated his gaze on Markus until a book with the boy's name materialised in the Omniscient Library.\n\nIn reading the details, Wei Zao's frown deepened.\n\n____\n\nName: Markus Reva\n\n...\n\nCultivation Method: Unknown\n\n____\n\n'Unknown? Not None, but Unknown? How can it be unknown, you're supposed to be Omniscient?!' He asked in exasperation.\n\n{...}\n\nBut he didn't have the time to interrogate his system further, because Markus didn't let out. He waved his wand once again and flicked it towards Gaige while producing the very same spell circle.\n\nGaige's eyes widened in shock, 'Damn it!'\n\nHe dodged and narrowly avoided the explosion. Before he could take a breath, Markus cast the spell once again!\n\nGaige was forced to dodge and weave continuously through intuition. Fortunately, he wasn't forced to contend with the explosion spell all the time. Based on observation, Gaige found out that Markus only cast that spell when he crossed a 5-meter boundary centred on Markus.\n\nThis suggested that Markus was weak in close combat, which happened to be Gaige's strength.\n\nBeyond that boundary, Gaige only had to face basic |Fireball|, |Earth Spike|, |Water Jet|, |Wind Blade| and so on.\n\nMarkus cast these spells at a staggering pace. He had forced Gaige to enter a defensive stance with dodging and blocking those attacks while interspersing warding spells to shield against the projectiles. Gaige figured that this was Markus' strategy: to finish the fight as quickly as possible by overpowering Gaige early with a barrage of attacks.\n\nFortunately, Gaige had figured it out! All he had to do was wait out Markus, that is, till Markus runs out of mana.\n\nWith that in mind, Gaige focused on the spells and implemented the most efficient manoeuvres to dodge them.\n\n\"Ha...\" One of the teaching apprentices in the audience sighed. \"It looks like Gaige figured it out. He's playing an attrition strategy to outlast Markus.\"\n\nThe other apprentices nodded in agreement and internally placed their bets on Gaige. The students followed suit and began to cheer for him. Only the F4 maintained silence and smirked in disdain at the other students.\n\nWei Zao hadn't relaxed one bit. Since he was already in the Foundation Establishment realm, he had a greater insight into Markus' current condition. He could clearly see that the boy was barely breaking a sweat. He had cast over 50 spells without pause, yet there was barely any lag in his casting.\n\n'He's not tiring out? But how?'\n\nHe perused the entry on Markus once again and searched for any details that stood out. It indicated that Markus had a below-average to non-existent aptitude for cultivation. There were no hidden bloodlines or special physiques that offered any advantages. His enchanted artefacts were fairly basic and didn't offer boosted mana capacity.\n\n\"How is he doing this?\" Wei Zao muttered while scratching his head in confusion.\n\n\"It must be the spells!\" Wei Zao concluded out loud, attracting the attention of his neighbours.\n\nWei Zao focused intensely on the spells circles summoned by Markus. Books pertaining to those spells materialised in his Omniscient Library, but they were all empty.\n\n\"What the hell! Why are they empty?\"\n\nIn response to his aggressive inquiry, the system maintained silence.\n\n{...}\n\nWei Zao cursed the system internally and ran through possible theories in his mind.\n\n'Wait! Maybe the boy is also a transmigrant with a system!'\n\n{Negative.} The system finally responded.\n\nWei Zao scoffed and rechecked the boy's registered teaching apprentice, Guy Larks.\n\nThe book that was already present in the Omniscient Library with Guy Larks didn't change and displayed the same information.\n\n'But... How?' Wei Zao exclaimed in defeat.\n\nWhile Wei Zao was undergoing an internal conflict, Gaige was bearing with the unending onslaught of spells from Markus. His initial confidence quickly began wavering as he found that there didn't appear to be any fluctuation in Markus' fervour.\n\n'How isn't he enervating himself?'\n\nEven the members of the audience caught on to the problem. The man who preemptively declared Gaige's victory swallowed his words and slinked back into the crowd.\n\nGaige realised that this couldn't go on any longer. Instead of his opponent, he was the one getting tired. His stamina was running out, and his mana pool was draining at a rapid rate in trying to ward out spells he couldn't dodge!\n\nHe recalled Markus' weakness in close combat and rushed forward. As he proceeded, he prepared the third sword stance under the first set of techniques complementing Insight into the Abyss.\n\nHe weaved through the approaching |Fireball| and the subsequent |Earth Spike|, and quickly passed the 5-metre safety boundary.\n\nRight on queue, Markus activated the explosion spell and directed it towards Gaige. In response, Gaige released the sword stance and produced the wave of darkness. Right as the explosion initiated, the darkness enveloped it and doused it with a barely audible puff.\n\nGaige smiled and rushed forward with renewed vigour.\n\n'Now!'\n\nRight as he passed the 3-metre boundary, Gaige knew that he was safe. Markus wouldn't initiate an explosion this close, lest he hurt himself. Therefore, Gaige prepared to contend against the basic spells that might block his path.\n\nTo his surprise, Markus activated a different spell circle. This looked nothing like the altered basic spells or the explosion spells Gaige had experienced earlier in this fight.\n\nInstead, a visible mist started to form and block his path. Gaige's instinct screamed and urged him to stop, however, his momentum was beyond his control. He had pledged his all in this gambit, there was no chance to stop!\n\nHe subconsciously closed his eyes and plunged through the mist.\n\n\"AAAAAA!\" A scream broke through the centre of the mist causing everyone to hold their breath.\n\nAs the mist subsided they saw Markus running out and assuming a position on the other side of the field.\n\nIn his original place, writhing on the floor in pain, was Gaige. Steam emanated from the boy's skin, and holes began forming in his outfit. When Wei Zao looked at Gaige's face closely, he could see light yellowish patches and some swelling.\n\n'Acid!' That was the only answer he could think of. He gritted his teeth and directed his attention once again at Markus' pouch. To his surprise, he didn't find anything out of the ordinary. There were no offensive items in there!\n\n\"Do you surrender?\" Markus said, loud enough so that Gaige could hear.\n\n\"What was that attack?\" A teaching apprentice blurted.\n\n\"Referee! This... Has to be cheating!\" One of the students screamed.\n\nThe referee furrowed his brows and spoke in a morose tone, \"We did not see any illegal moves or unregistered items being used. Please do not make false calls and besmirch the integrity of our process.\"\n\nAlthough he appeared composed on the surface, deep down he was extremely perplexed. He was supposed to intervene should the students suffer fatal or grave injuries. However, his scans right as the acid mist spell was cast indicated that there was no lethality to it. \n\nThis was confirmed after he observed Gaige who passed through the mist. The damage was only on the skin and could easily be treated through cheap regenerative ointments. The pain came from the extremely distributed nature of the attack. The small mist particles attacked from many points, making it hard for a Mana Condensation mage to brace for the damage.\n\nEveryone shut their mouths and retrained their attention into the arena.\n\n\"Do you surrender?\" Markus bellowed once again.\n\n\"NO!\" Gaige screamed, as he stood back up with visible strain, his eyes glazing over in rage.\n\nHe readied his sword once again and rushed forward haphazardly.\n\nMarkus sighed and performed the same sequence of defensive manoeuvres as before. Just like the last time, his explosion spell was absorbed.\n\nThis time, Gaige tried to extend the wave of darkness a bit further to absorb the acid mist as well. However, Markus anticipated this and pulled back the mist in advance, just outside the coverage of the wave.\n\nGaige ended up suffering the same injury and bellowed in pain as he struggled to stand up. The pain was excruciating, and his nerves were screaming in agony.\n\nHe tried once again, and failed spectacularly, incurring additional burns in the process.\n\n\"Do you surrender?!\" Markus shouted, with a demanding tone and a slight frown. He wasn't taking any pleasure in this, he just wanted to subdue Gaige as quickly as possible.\n\n'Suppress! Consume! I am the endless void!'\n\nGaige closed his palm into a tight fist and screamed, \"NOOOOOO!\"\n\nAs his primal shout reverberated, a blanket of darkness burst out from him and enveloped the entirety of the arena and a little beyond.\n\nWei Zao used his mana sense to inspect Gaige, and his eyeballs nearly burst out of their sockets in shock, \"It's... It's perfected resonance!\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-058]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":162,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 056 - Apprentice Tournament (Part One)","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nMany found it counterintuitive to pit students against each other when the assessment was focusing primarily on their instructors - the teaching apprentices. Why not just have the apprentices duke it out?\n\nIt was exactly because the evaluation was centred on the apprentices that the current format was employed. The tournament worked to gauge the capacity of a teaching apprentice apart from their cultivation. It looked at their ability to scout student talent, unearth it, and nurture it. It acted as an indicator of how effective the apprentices would be as instructors in the future.\n\nOf course, there was always the element of luck involved. Sometimes, an apprentice may hit the jackpot with an extremely talented student. Other times, the opposite combination may apply. But it was never truly possible to level the playing field so that everyone had a fair shot.\n\nGaige traversed through the Academy hallways, towards the site of his very first match. For the preliminary stages, four matches were set to occur at the same time. Each of them would take place in one of the repurposed practising fields.\n\nThe students weren't told who they were competing against. They were only provided with a tablet prescribing their own number allocation, and a field they were supposed to congregate to for their match. This blind match-up method was used to reduce the influence of psychological stress and other external factors that may influence the mental stability of the competitors.\n\nGaige wasn't the least bit worried about this match. He was confident in his skill, and Teacher Way's tutelage. He had stably reached the Late stage of the Mana Condensation realm and had practised and perfected all of his spellcasting and swordsmanship skills to their limits. This tournament would act as a platform for Gaige. A lot was riding on his success. He had to redeem his teacher's reputation and he had to prove his prowess to his father and his clan.\n\nAs he and his teacher arrived at the field, he cast his attention around and observed his competition. He never really cared much about others, so all the faces appeared unfamiliar to him.\n\n\"Woah! Who's that hunk?\"\n\n\"That's teaching apprentice Jo Way. Don't you know? He's the only teaching apprentice at the Foundation Establishment realm in Radiant Academy.\"\n\nHushed conversations started to erupt in the audience following their arrival.\n\n\"That's amazing! He looks so hot! And his student looks so striking too.\"\n\n\"That's Gaige Bori. He used to be the trashy Third Young Master from the Bori Clan, but recently his cultivation skyrocketed and he managed to trump Caine Jonas!\"\n\n\"Isn't Caine from the year above? He's that strong? Now that you mention it, he really does look striking. He has that cold, devil-may-care, external appearance.\"\n\nAs the irrelevant discussions propagated, a series of loud cheers and greetings broke through the din.\n\n\"Hey, Boss! What's up?\"\n\n\"Yeah, are you ready for your match today!\"\n\n\"Of course he's ready. What kind of question is that?\"\n\n\"Boss, good luck!\"\n\nFour large and pudgy boys trudged along with excited grins plastered across their faces. Their enthusiastic tones grabbed everyone's attention.\n\n\"Who're those four?\"\n\n\"You don't know them? They're the F4!\"\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"F4! Fatty 4! They're the biggest bullies of our batch.\"\n\n\"If they're the bullies, who're they calling Boss?\"\n\n\"Shh! Don't let them hear you calling them fatties!\"\n\n\"I didn't... Hey, why are you hiding behind me!\"\n\nGaige tuned out the mob chatter and honed in on the so-called F4. They walked up to a boy at the other end of the field and greeted him with a subtle hint of respect and reverence.\n\n\"Hey, what are you four doing here?\" The boy asked nonchalantly.\n\n\"We're allocated to this field as well!\" One of the F4 winked and nudged his neighbour with his elbows.\n\n\"Yeah! There was a... mistake... in the chart. So we just courteously asked the representative to smoothen things out,\" his neighbour added while rubbing his index and thumb finger together. Through connotation, Gaige understood that money changed hands.\n\nGaige frowned and tried to focus harder on the conversation. However, his attempt was interrupted by the chatter between the characters next to him.\n\n\"Why're you shivering? Are you scared?\"\n\n\"You've no idea how horrible those guys are! Before, they used to bully me by taking my lunch money or playing practical jokes on me. But in the past year, they've changed their methods! They caught me one day and strung me up by a tree. They then quizzed me on different subjects like cultivation, alchemy and whatnot. Whenever I got the wrong answer, they would use a branch to spank me!\"\n\n\"They spanked you in public? But... But you're a girl!\"\n\n\"I KNOW! uwuuu,\" the girl bawled.\n\nGaige gritted his teeth. \"Those scoundrels!\" he muttered under his breath.\n\n\"Boss, did you get a new enchanted artefact?\" One of the F4 exclaimed while pointing at the grimoire in the boy's hand.\n\n\"Oh, this? This was a gift,\" the boy clarified.\n\n\"Wow, that's a spatial enchantment!\" A random bloke next to the boy chimed in.\n\n\"HEY! Who do you think you are, disturbing our Boss?\" The first F4 member retorted.\n\n\"Yeah, stop eyeing our Boss' stuff! Or do you want me to fix your eyes?\" Another F4 member added while cracking his knuckles.\n\n\"Now, now, boys. Let's keep it civil, hmm?\" Their boss quickly interjected, causing the enraged F4 to slink back.\n\n\"Oh my goodness! He can control those fatties? Who is that boy?\"\n\n\"I remember now! That's Markus Reva. He's the genius from my friend's class.\"\n\n\"How come I've never heard of him before?\"\n\n\"Apparently he's very hidden. Everyone thought that he was just some orphan from the frontiers. But recently, he's been walking around with a very intricate enchanted artefact. One of my friends tried to steal it from him, but those F4 caught him and really did a number on him.\"\n\n\"That makes sense! Those rich fatties wouldn't become his followers for no reason. Look! He even has another enchanted artefact on him.\"\n\n\"Damn! Rich people sure have it easy...\"\n\nBefore the rumour mill could snowball out of control, an authoritative voice interjected, \"All participants please approach the bench.\"\n\nAll the students quieted down and walked over to the bench next to the combat arena. On it, there was a large box with a hole cut on its top. The referee standing next to the box took the tokens in each student's hand and dropped them into the box one at a time.\n\n\"We shall now decide on the match-ups,\" the referee declared once all the tokens were inside. He reached in and pulled out two tokens.\n\n\"First match: Number 32 vs. Number 41!\" He bellowed.\n\nTwo individuals stepped forth from the crowd and walked forward. Everyone gasped as they saw who the combatants were.\n\n\"It's Gaige and Markus!\" Someone exclaimed.\n\n\"Yeah, Boss! You can do it! Beat his ass!\" The F4 cheered in unison.\n\nThe referee waved his hands to stop the clamour and rattled, \"In order to keep things fair, the combatants are only allowed one offensive weapon of choice. Be it enchanted or unenchanted. Combatants, declare your weapons!\"\n\nIn response, Gaige unsheathed his sword.\n\n\"That's a Brionium sword!\"\n\n\"No way! Brionium is supposed to be one of the rarest and most expensive metals. How did Gaige get his hands on a sword like that?\"\n\n\"The Bori clan probably commissioned it.\"\n\nWhile the hushed chatter resurfaced, the referee turned his gaze towards Markus. In response, the boy unsheathed the wand and paraded it around for inspection. The referee frowned and nudged his chin towards the belt satchel. Markus smiled and opened it up for inspection as well. The referee directed his senses into the satchel and frowned harder.\n\nHe saw a bunch of useless materials inside. Coal, sulfur, a few liquids in phials. It didn't make any sense to him. But since there weren't any potions or boosting drugs hidden inside, he was satisfied. After that, he nudged his chin towards the grimoire in Markus' hand.\n\nMarkus handed the book in while saying, \"Am I not allowed to carry a book for reference?\"\n\n\"During a fight?\" The referee retorted while thoroughly checking the enchantment. \n\nHe then flipped through the pages to inspect if anything was hidden inside. All he saw were a bunch of uninterpretable scribbles and nonsensical spell circles. With a disdainful frown, he declared, \"It's your choice,\" while handing the book back.\n\n\"There's no offensive capabilities in this book!\" The referee bellowed for the record.\n\nThe two combatants then walked into the centre of the field. Once there, Markus extended his hands as a sign of sportsmanship and said with a neutral expression, \"Good luck!\"\n\nGaige snorted and reciprocated but with a visible frown on his face.\n\nMarkus didn't understand why Gaige was so averse to his gesture. He didn't know that Gaige had categorised Markus as a bully after seeing that he was involved with the F4. He thought that Markus was just being facetious with his act of goodwill.\n\nWithout pause, Gaige returned to a position away from the centre and entered a prepared stance with his sword at the ready.\n\nMarkus did the same and pulled out his wand. He then activated the grimoire in his hands, causing it to float to his side while opening up to a specific page.\n\nThe audience quieted down as the air became increasingly tense.\n\nThe referee assumed his position next to the arena. He was prepared to intercept the fight in case one of the combatants was about to suffer from a mortal injury. He activated the ritual formation around the arena, causing a translucent shield to materialise. This would ensure that the audience wouldn't get caught in the line of fire and suffer unwanted injuries.\n\nAfter making a thorough check for the final time, the referee raised a flag, and shouted, \"BEGIN!\".\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-057]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":163,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 055 - The Night Before","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nMarkus sprang up from his bed again and rushed over to the desk in his room. He wanted to check his belt satchel once more, to make sure that everything he had prepared was in place. After shuffling through its contents and inspecting the satchel's integrity, he sighed in relief and returned to lay down on his bed.\n\nHe closed his eyes and tried to relax his mind, in search of sleep. Tomorrow would be the first day of the apprentice tournament, and Markus was in a state of panic and excitement.\n\nIt had been exactly two semesters since he entered the tutelage of Master Larks. During this time, Markus had maintained his diligence in both practising magic, pushing his cultivation forward, and keeping a steady grade in his studies.\n\nOf those goals, he had managed to reach the Late stage of the Mana Condensation realm and had broadened his knowledge base with regards to basic magic, as well as the novel modular spellmaking his Master had developed. Concerning the latter, Markus had become proficient in cooking up different spells at a moment's notice through intuition. He still faced difficulty in recollecting the appropriate targetting and ranged subroutines, however, his Master suggested that he carry along a cheat sheet to glean off of during the fight. Markus was concerned about the practicality of holding a piece of paper during combat, but he didn't have a better solution for his predicament.\n\nFinally, with regards to his grades. Markus had surprisingly risen above the ranks and entered the upper leagues of academia. Usually, his grades floundered in the 50th percentile amongst his cohorts. But in the recent assessments, he had managed to clinch a few high scores and stabilised his position in the upper 95th percentiles.\n\nThe boost came as a surprise at first, 'Was I always this capable?' He would constantly ask himself.\n\nMaybe he was. Most of the time, he had to worry about escaping the clutches of his dedicated bullies. On top of that, there was always a subconscious bug at the back of his mind gnawing at him and making him feel inadequate.\n\nApart from all of that, he also found that recently his mental faculties had improved quite significantly. Things that he found hard to memorise had become trivial. His thought process had also shifted such that he was now able to rationalise concepts that made no sense to him before. Markus wondered if this was his latent talent blossoming after he had unburdened himself.\n\nThis was because after studying under Master Larks, a lot of his worries had diminished almost magically. He could now cast Tier-1 spells and stand his ground against his bullies! That was all theoretical, though. His Master taught him that it was never a good idea to retaliate against bullies using their own medicine. Violence and despair was a neverending cycle; he may triumph through force now, but it would only come back to bite him in the future.\n\nThe bullies may be subdued through his superior strength, however, they would remain discontent and persistently try to sabotage him in every turn. Markus then posited whether it would be better to thoroughly crush them with immense power.\n\n\"What good would that do? It will only make everyone fear you,\" Master Larks retorted at that time.\n\nBut that was also good! Isn't it better to be feared than loved?\n\n\"Respect built purely through fear is like a well filled with highly poisonous water. And respect built solely on love is like a well with very sweet and nurturing water. In the first case, no one would mess with you, but you will always remain lonely and isolated. In the latter, you have the entire village depending on you. But if you run out, the same villagers wouldn't think twice before shutting you down and forgetting all about you.\"\n\nThat profoundly confused Markus. If both had their weaknesses, what was he supposed to do?\n\nTeacher Jeeves clarified by elaborating on that metaphor, saying, \"You become the poison and the antidote. By that, I mean you should become a well that contains water that is sweet and nurturing, but at the same time is a poison to those that drink it. The moment they stop consuming the water, they all die.\"\n\nAlthough morbid, it made sense to Markus. He took these teachings to heart and attempted a different strategy in handling his bullies. \n\nMarkus leveraged his superior learning capacity and offered free tutoring and support to his bullies. He didn't bring this idea up straight to their faces, though. Through ingenious subliminal suggestion, he ingrained this thought into their minds. With his changed aura and presence, it didn't take long for the bullies to succumb. Sure, he had to get beaten up a few times, but it was all worth it in the end!\n\nAnd then, through a steady carrot-and-stick process, he altered the implicit food chain and moved up the hierarchy. After tasting the praise from their parents following their improved grades, his bullies became dependent on Markus.\n\nAfter that, it was all smooth sailing. Markus made sure to not reach beyond his limits; he was satisfied in maintaining the status quo. He was confident that he could subdue more people through this method, but he recollected his Master's teachings.\n\n\"A tree that grows above the forest's canopy has to weather the capricious storms by itself. It's good to be outstanding, but you must always be wary of your own limits, and the limits of your surrounding.\"\n\nMarkus realised that if he persisted and ended up becoming the de facto \"boss\" of his cohort, it would just add more problems to his plate. It was best to remain low-key and focus on achieving his goals.\n\nAnd his greatest goal was to achieve an outstanding victory in the apprentice tournament, which was starting tomorrow. A lot was riding on his performance, and to maximise his physical, and mental state, Markus had decided to go to bed early. However, his turbulent thoughts had made it difficult to find peace.\n\nKNOCK KNOCK\n\nA flat series of knocks interrupted his distraction. Markus sat up in his bed and called out audibly, \"Who is it?\"\n\n\"It's us, Guy Larks and Teacher Jeeves!\" A familiar voice answered.\n\nMarkus' eyes widened in excitement. He jumped up and rushed to open the door.\n\n\"Master! Teacher Jeeves! What brings you here so late?\" He asked while guiding them into his room. He cleared up the chair next to his desk and brought it closer to his bed.\n\n\"Late? You do realise that it's only 6 o'clock in the evening, right?\" Al chuckled as he sat down on the chair. Guy assumed his seat on the mattress and added, \"Did you have dinner? And sit down.\"\n\nMarkus nodded and respectfully sat down on his bed, midway between his Master and Teacher Jeeves.\n\n\"I ate an early dinner. I was planning to go to bed early so that I'm fresh and ready tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Hahaha! Don't be so stressed, my boy!\" Al said mirthfully. \"For your Master to remain in this academy, and have a future in the teaching profession, all you need to do is win the first match.\"\n\nHe added the last bit to assuage some of Markus' stress. Al continued, \"Speaking of the matches - there will be a few changes in the format. Due to the large number of students involved in the tournament, they've decided to run the preliminary matches parallelly in order to finish all of them on the same day tomorrow. The winners from the preliminary matches will move on to the quarter-finals the next day. The semi-finals will be held the day after and in the end the finals will be held after a day's break. They are going to release the match-ups tomorrow morning, including the field where it will be held.\"\n\n\"Al's right, Markus. You shouldn't pressure yourself over this match. We've both worked our best. You just have to apply yourself to a level that satisfies you. You must also try your best to showcase your skills and capabilities. Don't hold yourself back! Who knows, maybe you'll catch the attention of a famous teacher in the audience and enter their tutelage?\" Guy chimed in.\n\nMarkus vigorously shook his head and retorted, \"No matter who takes an interest in me, Master, I will never leave your side!\"\n\nGuy smiled bitterly and waved his hand, \"Now, now. Let's not make sweeping statements this early. If better opportunities come your way, you HAVE to take them.\"\n\nThe atmosphere was getting a little depressing, so Al changed the topic of discussion, \"Oh right! The reason I dragged your teacher here today was to give you this.\"\n\nAl reached into his satchel and retrieved a hardcover book. It was leatherbound with a metallic frame and had a vibrant blue mana gem at the centre of both sides.\n\nHe handed the book to Markus and explained, \"It's an enchanted artefact I made - it's called a grimoire. Think of it as an early congratulatory gift! All mages own grimoires like this, except this one has special enchantments. It is enchanted with spatial magic. So you can feed it as much paper as you want, and you can retrieve it by flipping through the book while recollecting key details from the page. If multiple pages have content similar to what you envisioned while flipping through it, then it will pull all of them out.\"\n\nMarkus quickly returned the grimoire towards Al while saying, \"This... This is too expensive, Sir. I can't accept this.\"\n\nAl pushed the grimoire back into Markus' hands. \"I made it especially for you; I insist that you take it. Consider it an early congratulatory present! I was hoping to spectate your matches in person, but my 2-star Beast Taming qualification examination is next week. I've handed a recording artefact to your Master so that I can watch your matches after I return.\"\n\nMarkus caressed the grimoire in his hands and retorted apprehensively, \"But isn't it a little premature?\"\n\n\"It's a foregone conclusion. I've seen how capable you are. I wouldn't have done this if I wasn't confident in your success. Even your Master thinks so, right Guy?\"\n\n\"That is correct. I believe in you, Markus. So don't work yourself up too much.\" Guy supported.\n\nThe three chatted for a few more minutes before Al and Guy stood up to leave.\n\n\"Alright then. Good night, Markus!\" Guy greeted as he stepped out the door.\n\nMarkus hugged the grimoire and shrunk into his mattress. He closed his eyes once again and waited for sleep to wash over him.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-056]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":164,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 054 - Training Montage","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Wrong! Gaige, you're losing control in your swing. In order to complement your swordsmanship with your cultivation method, your technique needs to be more fluid and must also exhibit an aura of suppression. For that, you need to time the release of your dark-infused mana with each sword form,\" Wei Zao instructed from the side-lines.\n\nThe teacher-student duo was currently situated in an empty training ground, courtesy of Gaige Bori's father. Although Wei Zao wasn't able to purchase a suitable weapon for Gaige from The Burning Forge, his father was quick on the uptake and provided an alternative of superior quality almost immediately. Apparently, the Bori Clan had made a huge windfall in the market after a successful bout against their biggest competitor. Wei Zao didn't put much thought into that matter, his main focus was on training Gaige for the tournament.\n\n\"But Teacher Way, I'm finding it difficult to manifest the dark mana...\" Gaige said in an exhausted voice. Even though he had been diligently practising the cultivation method provided by Wei Zao, which he now called Insight into the Abyss, he hadn't been able to make a breakthrough in moulding and controlling darkness mana, which was supposed to be a bloodline trait of an Abyssal Wyrm.\n\nWei Zao worried about this problem for a very long time. It was something even the Omniscient Library was unable to solve. However, this was within Wei Zao's expectations. Mages weren't technically supposed to have the ability to leverage their bloodline traits before breaking through to Foundation Establishment. Although Wei Zao was able to accelerate the activation in Gaige, it would be asking too much of the kid to become proficient in it while he was still in the Middle-stage of Mana Condensation realm.\n\nGaige shook his head to clear his mind once again and entered a concentrated state. He assumed the first stance in the sword techniques supplementing the Insight into the Abyss. He exhaled deeply and started to circulate his mana based on the instructions he recollected from the manual.\n\n'Unending Strike!' He recounted internally while shifting between the stages in the first stance. His movements were fluid and connected. Each stroke matched up with the next as if it were an elegant dance.\n\nWith a jerk, he then switched to the second stance, 'Suppressing Force!'\n\nThe motion maintained its fluidity, however, an aura of suppression manifested following each strike and slash. Every time the blade jerked and shifted direction, a wave of invisible force propagated a short distance. Any regular mortal would be unable to register this with their senses. However, Wei Zao could track these forces with his enhanced senses as a Foundation Establishment Mage.\n\nThat's right! He had only recently managed to break through from the Mana Condensation realm and stepped into the true world of Magehood. With the assistance of the Omniscient Library, he was able to optimise his own cultivation method, and through a rigorous process of assimilating and merging other cultivation methods, he managed to optimise it further and developed the Omniscient Path method of cultivation.\n\nIt was so phenomenal that it even amplified his mana capacity and physical strength beyond the limits of another mage in the same level. Therefore, Wei Zao was confident that he could go toe-to-toe, which mages in the Internal stage of the Foundation Establishment realm with ease.\n\nWith his improved senses and perception, Wei Zao zeroed in on Gaige's technique as the boy transitioned into the final stance in the first set of sword techniques associated with the Insight into the Abyss, 'Into the Void!'\n\nThese techniques were devised by borrowing and modifying existing sword styles and tailoring them to Gaige's cultivation. Of course, this was all done in the Omniscient Library, so there weren't any issues with it. Since Wei Zao only had access to the basic sword forms, the book he compiled for Gaige could only support him till he broke through into Foundation Establishment. By which time Wei Zao hoped to get his hands on a few more books and develop more advanced forms.\n\nThe last stance in the first set was where Gaige usually stumbled. He had to infuse darkness into his circulating mana and expel it through his sword at the same time as he transitioned through the steps.\n\nGaige concentrated to the max as he channelled his mana through his core and attempted to infuse darkness into it. He recited the mantras affiliated with his cultivation in his head to enter the perfect state of mind to achieve this.\n\nHe raised the sword above his head and prepared himself. With a forceful motion, the sword descended. As it separated the air during its descent, a void-black streak formed in its wake and extended forward as a growing crescent before fizzling out immediately.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" Wei Zao exclaimed and approached Gaige, who collapsed into a puddle of his own sweat. The entire process had drained his mana and left him \n\n\"I... did... it...\" Gaige repeated through heavy breaths.\n\n\"Yes, you did! Yes. You. Did.\" Wei Zao said with a bright smile plastered across his face. He then noticed the deflated body of Gaige panting on the ground and added with a chuckle, \"Just don't use it right at the beginning.\"\n\n____\n\n\"Master. Can you take a look at this?\" Markus asked as he brought over a book to Guy, who was once again chatting with Al in his office.\n\n\"What happened to your book? It looks like it died and came back to life,\" Al commented as he leaned over to take a peak.\n\nMarkus didn't bring the workbook Guy had \"printed out\" for him before, this was his own personal writing book. And Al's description perfectly described its current state.\n\nOne must know that owning a copybook was a luxury in this world. The process of making and binding them required a lot of manpower and man-hours, and so they were expensive to purchase. Furthermore, since this world lacked a proper printing press, a decent publication was even more costly since trained scribes were required to copy and typeset them.\n\nTherefore most students would often purchase unbound hardback covers and sheets of paper separately. When needed, they would bind additional empty sheets into the hardback covers using a length of binding thread. Once the hardback cover was filled, they would purchase another one and start the process anew.\n\nThis method was economical and was the general trend amongst students of all social standings.\n\nAs an orphan without much to his name, Markus had to come up with alternative strategies. Since he couldn't even purchase hardback covers, he had to find defective ones from second-hand bins or the garbage from book stores. Furthermore, he couldn't afford the purchase of sheet packages, and thus he had to source scrap paper from disposed of books and make full use of them. To that end, he even shrunk his handwriting to a near indiscernible size just to cram in as much information into the page as possible.\n\nThe worst part was that due to the lack of sufficient hardback covers, he had to shove in more sheets than capacity into his last one, which itself was in a state of ruin.\n\nMarkus dropped his head in embarrassment. Al noticed this and quickly realised his faux pas. Right as Markus was about to retrieve his book, Guy exclaimed, \"Did you figure out a way to modularise the targeting and ranged components from spells?\"\n\nMarkus nodded and explained, \"Right! I was going through those spells once again and found that I could isolate the modules that governed the ranged aspects of spellcasting into a separate subroutine. So then in practice, I cast this subroutine using the wand and cast the main sequence using my own capacity, I can reduce the mana consumption by half!\"\n\nAs Markus spoke excitedly, he completely forgot about his earlier embarrassment. Al turned to Guy and mouthed 'Thank you,' to which Guy reciprocated with a slight nod and a smile.\n\n\"That's amazing!\" Guy chimed in when Markus finished. He then turned the page and found a similar spell circle, except with some variations in it.\n\n\"What's this?\" He asked,\n\n\"Oh. Even though I was able to create those subroutines, I couldn't apply them to all the cases. In situations where the subroutine wasn't applicable, I had to make a new one. I tried to generalise them into one standard general subroutine, however, the final result was a little beyond my ability at the moment,\" Markus declared while carefully turning the pages to another section containing multiple smaller spell circles.\n\nAl nodded in acknowledgement and chimed in with his opinion, \"It seems that the generalised subroutine to tackle the ranged components of spellcasting requires you to cast up to three different spell circles at once. It should be beyond your limit as a Mana Condensation mage, but I think once you breakthrough, it should become possible.\"\n\nMarkus nodded solemnly and retrieved his copybook.\n\n\"On that note. I just noticed something. Did you break through to the Middle stage?\" Al asked with elation sparkling in its eyes.\n\nMarkus smacked his forehead and unleased a smile capable of brightening up the room three times over. \"I just broke through last night! I was going to tell Master right away, but today when I woke up, I got a burst of inspiration on this generalised subroutine...\" he finished with some embarrassment.\n\nGuy chuckled and patted Markus' shoulder, \"That's great! I'm so proud of you.\"\n\nUpon hearing the praise Markus' eyes started to tear up, \"Umm... I should probably go practise...\" he muttered and ran out of the room.\n\nThe two people remaining in the room smiled wholeheartedly as they observed the boy's receding figure.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-055]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":165,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 053 - Mana Economy","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"What is this?\" Al said while holding the wand in his hand and inspecting it. \"It's kind of... cute,\" he commented with a chuckle.\n\nGuy smiled wryly and responded, \"It's a wand. I made it to assist Markus during spell casting.\"\n\nAl nodded and added, \"Yeah, I was expecting this when you set out.\"\n\nHe then reached into his pocket and touched his storage plate and channelled his mana into it, \"Here, take a look!\"\n\nA staff with a massive gem at its tip materialised in his free hand. It had a weaving design that sort of resembled a stereotypical magical staff from the fantasy movies back on Earth.\n\n\"This staff is enchanted to be able to cast a large |Fireball|.\"\n\nThe corner of Guy's mouth twitched as he held the staff in his hand in defeat.\n\n\"So you're saying that you had the answer to my problems all along? Why didn't you tell me from the beginning?\" Guy asked in exasperation. \"Do you know how long I spent just to end up with this?\"\n\nAl smiled an innocent smile and replied apologetically, \"I'm sorry. It's been a really long time since I've had to guide others. I only recollected the application of magical staves after you left my office. I was going to inform you the next time we met, however you never came back after that day...\"\n\nGuy closed his hands into a fist and exhaled loudly through his nose to calm himself, \"It's fine... What matters is that I did it...\"\n\n\"But why is your... staff... so small? Won't it shatter under the stress of casting such large spells?\"\n\nGuy quickly corrected Al, \"First off, it's a wand. And two, it's not the size, but how you use it that matters.\" \n\nGuy coughed to cover up his inadvertent double entendre and continued, \"I don't plan on using it to support the weight of an entire spell. It will only be used as a supplement to reinforce ranged spellcasting.\"\n\nAl hummed in appreciation. \"Let's test it out!\" He then declared.\n\nWithout waiting for Guy's response, Al activated a |Teleportation| spell and displaced Guy to his own testing ground.\n\nGuy found himself in a familiar room; it was the same place where Al demonstrated the difference between the two types of enchanted swords. Just like last time, there were two intact training dummies prepared to bear the onslaught of Al's spells.\n\nAl grasped the wand by its grip and pointed its tip towards one of the dummies.\n\n\"So, how does it work?\" He asked in anticipation.\n\n\"You need to manifest the spell circle for the spell and impose it onto the gem on the wand. Then, you channel your mana through the spell circle like normal AND activate the gem at the same time.\"\n\n\"Got it!\" Al affirmed and immediately began to form the design for a modular |Fireball| spell. Al had familiarised himself with Guy's modular spellmaking techniques and had become proficient in forming a myriad of simple spells.\n\nHe had also figured out a way to only rely on his mana to fuel a fire. While it was inefficient and required a large amount, Al found that the consumption was still lower than a regular |Fireball| spell.\n\nWithin a span of half a second, the spell circle materialised in a plane normal to the vector the wand was pointing towards, and a spinning fireball took shape.\n\nAl flicked his wrist through intuition and the fireball propelled itself at a high speed and collided with one of the training dummies. The impacted dummy exploded magnificently, leaving only a wooden stump in its place.\n\n\"My word!\" Al exclaimed. \"It barely used any mana!\"\n\nWithout taking a pause, Al started to repeat the process at a much higher frequency. A continuous stream of fireballs began to shoot out from the tip of the wand - it was as if a machine gun was firing balls of hot, burning gas instead of bullets.\n\nAnd without a target, the fireballs collided against the farthest wall in the training area, leaving a scorched mark and a growing crack after each impact.\n\nGuy slowly distanced himself from Al, who was wearing a manic smile and bellowed with a crazed expression.\n\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Al cackled as the fireballs boomed in the room unceasingly.\n\nAfter the impact from the 300th fireball, by Guy's rough estimate, Al stopped and took inventory of his mana levels.\n\n\"This is amazing, Guy! I used little to no mana. And the mana gem replenishes faster than it is being depleted to propel the fireball!\" Al said while raining his praise on Guy.\n\n\"What's the wand's condition?\" Guy asked in concern. Al quickly ran an |Inspect| cantrip on the wand in his grasp and conducted a thorough search for any physical or magical problems.\n\n\"No effects as far as I can see,\" he assuaged, and then shifted the topic, \"Honestly, I'm impressed by your inscription technique. I have never seen anything like this before, but somehow it feels familiar.\"\n\n\"It's something I came up with. I took inspiration from 'Journal of Maine Baxter - Incomplete Tests and Theories' in their entry on the variable enchantment.\"\n\nAl snapped his finger in recollection and chimed in, \"That's right! I was also planning to recommend that book to you after explaining about magical staves.\" And then in a low voice, he muttered, \"Damn! If only you had visited me once again after our meeting, I could have saved you so much time...\"\n\n\"Anyways, I just can't get over how well your enchantment works in conjunction with the modular spellmaking method. By offloading the contribution for the ranged component of the spells to the mana gem, the stress on the caster is lowered significantly. The best part is that it appears as if the mana contributed by the gem is at the breakeven point and matches the rate of repletion.\"\n\nAl paused for dramatic effect and evoked with gusto, \"You've developed a way to cast spells for free!\"\n\n\"That's a bit of an exaggeration! |Fireball| is a pretty basic Tier-1 ranged spell. I don't think the mana required to sustain a fireball would be excessive,\" Guy retorted. Deep down, he was also quite excited. When he tested the wand earlier, he took note of this peculiarity as well, however, he wanted to get confirmation from someone more experienced first.\n\n\"Let's not split hairs about the specificity of the claims! Markus can effectively cut down on mana consumption by using physical fuel as a source. If he relies on mana just as a catalyst to facilitate the combustion reaction, he can cast as many fireballs as he wants as long as he doesn't run out of fuel. And then, he will still have enough mana to cast 100 other spells! Do you understand just how absurd that sounds? If someone told me that a Middle or Late-stage Mana Condensation mage could cast 300 spells consecutively, I would cut open their skulls and check to see if their brain was intact!\"\n\nAnd then, with a serious expression, Al asked, \"Are you sure you want to hand this to Markus?\"\n\nRight as he finished, Al summoned the |Teleportation| spell circles and whisked himself and Guy back to his office.\n\nGuy wasn't distracted by the sudden shift in scenery, he was preoccupied with the intricacies of Al's seemingly simple question.\n\n'Right! Should I give this to Markus?'\n\nGuy was reminded of his earlier conversation with Al in this very office. After months of diligent research and effort, he had created an item - a tool - that was a boon to someone like Markus, who was magically challenged. However, it was only after testing the tool that he realised its propensity as a weapon. And a devastating one at that!\n\nSure, the wand only presented its advantages at the lower Tiers of magic. It wouldn't offer similar ease when casting higher-tiered spells such as |Earth-Shatter|, |Flamestrike|, and so on. But he couldn't discount the dangers of a rogue and unfettered |Fireball|. While mages would still be able to contend against it, it wasn't the case for regular mortals.\n\nUltimately, this was a question of ethics. However, Guy recognised that he couldn't apply the same standards of ethics from back on Earth when analysing the situation. So in the end, he relied on his gut.\n\n\"Yes,\" Guy declared confidently.\n\nAl raised his eyebrows, \"How are you so sure?\"\n\nGuy shook his head, \"I'm confident with myself,\"\n\n\"What does that have to do with anything?\" Al retorted in confusion\n\nAlmost on queue, a series of knocks interrupted their conversation, \"Teacher Jeeves, Master Larks? It's me, Markus.\"\n\nA familiar voice resounded from the other side of the door. Al waved his hands and the door swung open slowly.\n\nMarkus walked in with a bright smile and bowed respectfully at the two occupants.\n\n\"It's my responsibility to properly train my students and teach them to respect and value their powers. If they cannot do something so simple, they shouldn't be allowed to train as a mage. I am confident that I've taught Markus well,\" Guy said to Al in a voice only the two of them could hear and picked up the wand placed on the table.\n\n\"Let's go, Markus! I have a gift for you,\" Guy exclaimed cheerfully while guiding Markus by the shoulder.\n\nAl was left alone in the room. The man sighed out loud and chuckled with a trace of bitterness mixed in. His eyes glazed over as he reminisced about his past with his first student, Ziva Lune.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-054]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":166,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 052 - Swish and Flick!","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nThe inscription Guy had applied on the mana gem was special, in that it did not require the enchanter to forge a special body to contain it. This meant that Guy had more leeway in choosing the item to embed the gem into.\n\nHowever, this did not make things any easier, because having too many choices can sometimes become a massive headache.\n\nGuy brainstormed many possibilities while scanning his eyes around the storage room. He wondered whether he should embed the gem into an edged single- or two-handed weapon such as a sword, sabre, axe, spear and so on. That way, if Markus happens to enter a stressful scenario and is unable to form any spell circles, he can resolve to use the weapon itself to do substantial damage.\n\nIt was a viable option, but Guy dropped the idea because there was a high likelihood of Markus hurting himself by mishandling the edged weapon. Without proper techniques and martial-arts to complement the weapon, it would be like handing a writing utensil to a baby. And since Guy was from a world that had advanced to an era of ranged warfare with hot weapons, and had never dabbled in fencing or weapon-based martial arts, he was seriously lacking in that department and wasn't confident in teaching Markus.\n\nThe other alternative would be to use a blunt weapon that dealt damage through bludgeoning and impact, such as a hammer, bat, staff and so on. Those were generally friendlier to newbies, although they weren't totally safe. So Guy felt more comfortable with this option, but his conscience still felt uneasy.\n\nHe was just a simple teacher after all! Even after observing various atrocities in his old world, he wasn't someone who would willingly hand weapons that could wreak havoc and potentially harm the user, to his own students. He did recognise the irony in his thought process. He had essentially created ammunition capable of unleashing damage of unimaginable proportions for his student, but now he was being apprehensive about sourcing a weapon to hold it, just because it felt unethical.\n\n\"Why is that, though?\" Guy pondered out loud.\n\nIt was after a brief moment of contemplation, that Guy recognised the cause for his present dilemma! He was fine with handing the enchantment to his student, even though it held power beyond Markus' limits. That was because Guy was confident in tempering Markus and training him to respect the power it withheld. However, Guy was apprehensive about handing a cold weapon to Markus because Guy couldn't guarantee that he could train Markus with equal stringency.\n\nThis conclusion greatly narrowed Guy's search. He didn't want to use a body that was beyond his own limits. This straightaway crossed out all metal-based solutions.\n\nThus, Guy drew his attention to the wide assortment of woods stored in the inventory. Wooden weapons were commonplace in academies and sects as they were optimal for training purposes. Logically, it was safer to teach students using a non-lethal replica of a weapon as opposed to the real deal. After all, it would be shameful if a student lost a few fingers or appendages accidentally during training.\n\nIn addition to that, wood wasn't a scarce or expensive resource. It was possible to mass-produce training weapons made of wood, but the same could not be said for their metal counterparts.\n\nGuy inspected his choices available in the storage room and tried to cross-reference them with the data stored in the RoK. Just like back on Earth, there was an abundance of choices of wood in this world. Actually, with the addition of mana, there were even more options to choose between. Some wood types were more receptive to specific types of mana and enchantments, just like with mana metals.\n\nRather than floundering between choices, Guy decided that it was best to solidify his purpose and then decide on the wood. Seeing as his enchantment wasn't type-specific, the wood choice had to be neutral in its receptivity to mana of different types. What mattered the most to Guy was the body's ability to conduct the flow of mana. He wanted to ensure that there was no resistance when Markus channelled his mana through the body into the mana gem, and when the mana flowed from the mana gem to the body.\n\nWith some filters to narrow his search, Guy was able to find two suitable solutions: Menryl tree, and the Illuminescent Banyan tree.\n\nThe wood from the Menryl tree was distinct as it had a pleasant bluish-cyan hue. It was the first time Guy had observed such a pigment in a tree. Through some cursory reading, Guy realised that this shade was a result of dense mana channels running parallel to the wood's grains. Usually, the Menryl tree is found above dense mana deposits and is used as a marker when searching for mana crystal mines. The tree has a symbiotic relationship with those mines in that it absorbs tainted mana from the atmosphere, extracts the impurities for its own growth, and shoves the refined environmental mana into the soil, which in turn solidifies in the mines. The wood itself is exceedingly strong and opposed to bending.\n\nThe Illuminescent Banyan tree is different from the Menryl tree in many ways, but also similar. Unlike the Menryl trees, the Illuminescent Banyan is solitary. In actuality, the Illuminescent Banyan refers to the smaller trees that take root in the trunk of a much, much larger host tree and form offshoots and grow. The entire structure is often labelled as the Banyan since they can't be fully separated until it is cut down and processed.\n\nOnce processed, the primary tree is generally discarded as it does nothing apart from acting as a channel for sustenance to the offshoots. The secondary trees, however, are most functional as they produce succulent, mana-rich fruits, robust vines to assist in cloth-making, and syrupy sap that has a wide range of uses in alchemy.\n\nIn many ways, a live Illuminescent Banyan is more valuable than a dead one.\n\nHowever, once chopped up and processed, the sinews produced from the wood of the secondary trees have many uses in weapon and armoursmithing. As its name suggests, the Illuminescent Banyan has a bright bluish glow. This glow stems from the rich mana channels present in the secondary trees' trunks.\n\nGuy quickly thought of an idea and fetched a handful of Illuminescent Banyan sinews and a length of Menryl wood. To materialise his idea, he didn't require an excessive quantity of the two materials, and so he picked them up from the scraps container to remain economical.\n\nAfter setting up in the workshop once again, he retrieved a few wood-working tools and began his work. Back on Earth, Guy had travelled to many villages and secluded locales that thrived on native craftsmanship. Most of the time, these products were made by hand using the natural resources available in the vicinity. Through that, Guy had picked up a lot of such mundane skills. Woodworking and wicker crafting were a few such techniques Guy was familiar with.\n\nSlowly, Guy because to carve the Menryl wood to form a cylindrical, thin body of tapering thickness. At its base, it had a radius of half a centimetre, and at the tip, it was around a quarter. Without standardised measuring tools, Guy eye-balled those parameters when carving. After spending additional time sanding out any unevenness, Guy was left with a smooth bluish-cyan tapering rod.\n\nGuy then used another tool to carve through-holes at set intervals. With Menryl's robustness, the holes didn't detract much from its stability.\n\nWith that done, Guy retrieved the sinews and worked them till they were uniform. The special property of Illuminescent Banyan was that it maintained a brownish hue till mana ran through the channels within.\n\nHe wound the sinews using his wickering techniques to form an ergonomic handle. During this process, Guy brought in the inscribed gem and used the sinews to fasten it into the base of the handle. He then worked the finer sinews to form a spiralling pattern along the shaft. He wound the sines through the periodic holes to tighten them up.\n\nOnce it reached the tip, Guy used a strong and permanent binding reagent to fasten the windings and coated the shaft in the reagent to affix the design. He then dipped the handle in another lacquer that was smoother once dried.\n\nUsing a few spells, Guy accelerated the treating process.\n\nFinally, Guy beheld the craftsmanship in his hands.\n\nIt was almost the length of his forearm and had a brownish handle. The shaft had a similar brownish hue with a spiralling pattern and infrequent sections that revealed a pleasant blue, corresponding to the Menryl base.\n\n\"What a beautiful Magic Wand!\" Guy exclaimed while exhaling in satisfaction.\n\nWhat he settled for, in the end, was to use a simple magic wand as a body for the enchantment. He derived his inspiration from a series of young-adult modern-fantasy novels from back on Earth that were highly acclaimed.\n\nThe solution was simple and addressed his requirements directly. There was also no fear of Markus accidentally hurting himself, except of course if he pokes his own eyes.\n\nGuy grasped the handle of the wand and prepared a basic fire starting spell in his mind.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Guy flourished the wand and pointed the tip towards a small pile of wood shavings next to him.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-053]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":167,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 051 - Spellcasting in HD","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nGuy applied for leave with the academy's personnel management department with visible apprehension. He was only a teaching apprentice, and he wasn't entitled to many days off till his apprenticeship was completed. However, Guy remembered that he had saved up his vacation days since joining the academy and planned to cash them in. He expected some pushback, but surprisingly his request was accepted without any back and forth.\n\nHe intended to finally create the enchanted item for his student over this break. Thankfully, with the influx of cash from the steel weapon and armour sales, Guy's entire timetable was pulled forward and he was able to check off a lot of boxes on his plan. His initial estimate suggested that he would only have less than a month left till the tournament by the time he'd have finished his project. However, he was now flush with both cash and time, seeing as there was a little over five months till the deadline!\n\nThis was great news, and Guy could barely hold in his excitement. At this point, he had everything prepared and all that was left was to bring it all together.\n\nThe first step in accomplishing this was to inscribe a mana gem with the variable-type enchantment he discovered in his early research.\n\nGuy solicited the use of one of the workspaces in The Burning Forge for this since he found the ambience tranquil and conducive to tasks that required intricate workmanship. Furthermore, Guy wanted to be prepared in case he needed miscellaneous items. He planned to requisition them from the shop's storage. It was one of the underlying benefits Guy gained through his partnership with Karmin.\n\nGuy still held some concerns with regards to the design set to be inscribed into the gem. After rereading the case study on the variable enchantment in the guild's library, he had a greater understanding of the requirements and the subtleties behind the process. And through that, he determined one significant limitation which was that although the inscription could vary, the possible variations that it could assume were limited.\n\nEssentially, the enchanter would have to inscribe a diagram which was the superposition of all the possible spells the variable inscription could assume in the future. This multiplied the difficulty of the inscription the more variations were required from the enchantment.\n\nThis problem stumped Guy in the beginning. He wanted to develop an enchanted item that could accommodate any spell Markus intended to cast using the modular spellmaking strategy. Guy couldn't anticipate all the permutations derived from those modular spells, because there would be near infinite.\n\nOne solution he considered was to simply inject a blob of inscribing ink into the mana gem, and let Markus control the liquid to form the spell constructs he needed. On paper, this sounded logical, however it was impossible to implement in practice. Throwing in a massive blob of inscription ink inside the gem without any foundation caused the enchantment to collapse, turning it into a dud. The best way to visualise this is to think of inscribing as removing parts of a wall. The more you take out, the less stable it becomes.\n\nOvercoming this problem took a week of intense work on Guy's part. Because his application case was so novel, there weren't many existing solutions to address it.\n\nIn the end, the method Guy used took inspiration from modern technology back on Earth - LED displays!\n\nHe started experimenting by drawing the inscriptions as closely spaced dots. Guy had to try multiple times to get the perfect rhythm down so that the inscription process didn't fail, and he had to determine the optimal size of the dots and separation between them so that the enchantment was valid and the mana circuit formed by the mithril in the ink didn't disconnect.\n\nUltimately, he was able to finalise those parameters.\n\nNext, he envisioned the final inscription for the enchanted item as a 2D grid of evenly spaced dots, similar to pixels on a display. He wanted to make it so that when Markus intended to form a construct, he just had to activate the appropriate \"pixels\".\n\nThis idea brought its own set of problems. First off, unlike the flowing inscription from the process journal, this scenario resulted in small pools that were stationary. This meant that the ink used had some functionalities and ingredients that were redundant.\n\nSo through a lot of trials and cross-referencing, Guy was able to optimise the ink constitution to fit his needs. Although he wasn't able to test it out, He was able to confirm that theoretically his intention would be achieved.\n\nOf what remained, the key ingredient of note in the ink was the Slime Residue, which allowed the inscription to become variable. Slimes by nature do not have a solid body. They are a special breed of lifeforms that come into existence with a core already formed. Their closest relatives are wisps.\n\nTheir bodies are made of a liquid substance that is inert, except for its ability to digest biomass at a slow and steady rate. However, when infused with a stream of mana, the liquid substance becomes activated and can be shaped and formed like a non-Newtonian fluid.\n\nThe slime residue in the enchanting ink leverages this property to activate and deactivate specific inscription formations according to how the mage channels their mana. This leaves only the pertinent part activated and everything else deactivated.\n\nUsing Guy's pixel-based inscription method, the separation between dots was sufficient for mana to move through without excessive resistance. Guy posited that the final strategy would be for the user to visualise the spell in their minds, and impose a mana-based projection of that spell onto the gem which in turn would activate the appropriate pixels. Then, the mage simply has to channel their mana through the enchanted item to activate the spell.\n\nWith all of that in mind, Guy got down to business.\n\nHe carefully mixed the ingredients following the prescribed measurements and poured them into his inscribing tool. He then retrieved a vial of molten Mithril from The Burning Forge's inventory and steadily poured the substance into the tool.\n\nWith that done, he began inscribing on his chosen gem. For this project, he resolved to use a medium-large unattuned mana gem because it wouldn't clash or augment with any spells.\n\nHis wrists gyrated in a steady rhythm as his hand translated in a perfect horizontal. Once it reached an estimated end, it quickly reverted and restarted the translation. It reminded Guy of the old dot-matrix printers his parents once showed him at a museum.\n\nHowever, Guy couldn't afford to reminisce on those pleasant memories! He further engrossed himself in the task and maintained his pace as per his practice.\n\nAt a measured rate, a corporeal projection of dots began to materialise before the mana gem. Guy started to strain his eyes so that he wouldn't lose his position or skip a dot.\n\n'I'm gonna need glasses if I even have to do something like this again,' Guy lamented internally as he shifted his buttocks deliberately.\n\nDay turned to night by the time Guy applied the final dot. The moment he separated his inscription tool from the mana gem, the corporeal projection turned brighter and started to shrink.\n\nOnce the inscription concluded, Guy started to massage his neck and followed a set of stretching exercises to loosen his body.\n\n'I'm never doing this. Ever. Again.' Guy declared while trying to work through the pain and stiffness. Since the work was engrossing, he was oblivious to the pain. But without anything to distract him, Guy became fully aware of his own body!\n\nSuppressing his anxiety and excitement over the successful inscription, Guy ran through all of his exercises and thoroughly loosened his body.\n\nFinally, he picked up the gem and inspected it. He checked to see if the dots inside were proper.\n\nAfter five minutes of a thorough once over, Guy exhaled in satisfaction and pumped his fists in the air.\n\n'I did it!' He congratulated himself.\n\n'Now, to see if it works...'\n\nGuy recollected a spell from his memory. He chose a spell that was specifically modular in nature, and included more intricate and smaller shapes. He wanted to stress test his creation to check if it could withstand the worst-case scenarios.\n\nWith another exhale to calm his mind, he imprinted the construct as a mana projection onto the gem. Slowly, the gem started to illuminate.\n\nAs Guy peered at the gem, he saw the pixel inscriptions lighting up together and forming the exact construct he envisioned in his mind.\n\n'Yes!' Guy exclaimed as he deactivated the mana gem. Just as it lit up, the pixels dimmed and turned inert. In total, the activation and deactivation were instant, barring the time taken to form the spell in his mind. This was a promising outcome!\n\n'Next, we embed this into an item,' Guy commented while carefully placing the inscribed gem inside a cushioned box.\n\nHe then walked back into the inventory and beheld the materials before him.\n\n'But what do I embed this on?' Guy pondered.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-015]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":168,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 050 - To Do or Not To Do","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\nGuy was extremely impressed at Karmin's efficiency. Just two weeks after they hashed out their contract, steel weapons and armour started to make an appearance in the market!\n\nGuy didn't know whether the bureaucracy of registering this world's equivalent of a patent was as extensive as back on Earth, but he could make an educated guess.\n\nIn addition to that, Karmin had taken Guy's advice and tested with varying the carbon content in the steel being produced and had also released weapons with higher and lower carbon content to fit the user's needs. Some weapons also contained a mix of both types, which reminded Guy of the katanas from Earth.\n\nOn top of that, Karmin had also begun testing with alloying steel with other kinds of mana metals to create element-aligned and mana reactive weapons and armours. Most of these appeared to be in the testing phase, but the oral advertising in and around The Burning Forge encouraged the crowd to pre-order for a lowered price.\n\nGuy inwardly praised Karmin for his business acumen. The man knew how to work the population like sheep. His marketing strategies could only be defined as textbook examples from Earth!\n\nHowever, unlike most capitalistic businessmen from his old world, Karmin was a man true to his words. Karmin registered Guy's current bank account with Drayden Bank as the deposit point for Guy's share of the profits from the sale of steel weapons. The benefit of being a partner to a massive company with branches in different cities and towns was that the scope of sales was massive. This meant that Guy found himself flush with cash very quickly.\n\nDuring the past four weeks, Guy had been on cloud nine. He was tempted to withdraw the amount from his account, lay it over his mattress and roll around!\n\nThe currency in this world was archaic. Copper coins made up the lowest denomination. A hundred copper coins comprised a silver coin, and a hundred silver coins comprised a gold coin. These currencies primarily applied for the purchase of mortal and low-magic items. For items that were exclusively suited to mages, the common currency was in mana crystals of low-, medium- and high-grade.\n\nA common person could survive a day with 20 copper coins. It would cover their living arrangement in a shabby inn and their sustenance from cheap street food.\n\nWith that as a baseline, an average forged steel weapon was sold at the price of 50 silver coins. An average forged iron weapon is sold slightly lower at 30-40 silver coins. Casted weapons cost a quarter of the amount due to their ease of manufacturability.\n\nSo in essence, Guy was making around 2 to 6 silver coins per sale. Alone it may not sound like much, but considering the scale, it was no coincidence that Guy had to upgrade his bank's package!\n\nAs Guy was returning from the local branch of Drayden Bank, he kept his ears open for the gossip lingering in the streets.\n\n\"Have you heard of the new steel weapons by The Burning Forge?\"\n\n\"Yea... who are you again?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm just a passerby, good citizen of Radiant City.\"\n\n\"Okay...\"\n\n\"Apparently, the steel weapons are exactly like Dwarven metals!\"\n\n\"What? No way! The Burning Forge is probably falsely advertising again. I heard a rumour that they're skimping on-\"\n\n\"Yes way! The Smithing and Enchanting Guild as guaranteed it as so!\"\n\n\"Wow! I bet it costs a lot though...\"\n\n\"No! I heard that it costs almost the same as an iron weapon!\"\n\n\"Really! I need to check that out.\"\n\n\"Yes, good citizen! You should go this afternoon. The Burning Forge is going to do a demonstration in which they will clash a steel sword with the market's alternatives of the same cost. I heard that steel is much, much stronger!\"\n\n\"That's probably a reach. I bet they'll use faulty test weapons to boost their credibility.\"\n\n\"They are also accepting audience participation. If you can bring your own weapon made of metal alloys from a list published in the market's bulletin board, and break The Burning Forge's steel weapon of the same type, then you can qualify for a massive cash reward!\"\n\n\"Wow! I'm going to see if my Kaminite-Orichalcum broadsword qualifies for the test!\"\n\nGuy chuckled at the inconspicuous shill's effectiveness in influencing people. He secretly threw up a thumbs-up and a 'Fighting!' as he passed by.\n\nRadiant City was considered the commerce capital of the Solar Empire. The Maika Clan didn't have many mage powerhouses backing them, but they were so financially endowed that the Emperor had no choice but to respect their Duchy. Their success was in part due to their laxer trade and commerce laws, as well as their willingness to invest in local industries that showed promise.\n\nSince it was their speciality, Radiant City, which was the centre of the Maika Duchy, had a bustling yet well-managed commerce district. It wasn't haphazard like in most other cities. For a business to open a stall in the district they had to go through multiple stages with the city's management to get the permit. The city had planned the commerce district with great detail. Even for a first time visitor to the city, all it would take was an initial visit to understand the layout.\n\nFor instance, Guy was interested in purchasing ingredients for the inscribing ink for enchanting. To get this, he had to visit the section of the district that bordered the weapons and armours, and the alchemy departments. It was an intuitive process.\n\nGuy followed the directions displayed on the signs hanging near the streets and managed to reach the street that corresponded to the shops that catered to both alchemists and enchanters.\n\nThrough word of mouth, Guy knew that only one shop in this street could cater to his needs, and so he scanned the boards hanging in front of the shops for \"Myriad Emporium\".\n\nAs he pushed open the doors of the shop, a pleasant ring echoed and indicated his presence.\n\n\"Good afternoon, customer! Welcome to the Myriad Emporium, home to a myriad of ingredients and materials for your enchanting needs. How may I help you?\"\n\nA smiling woman who appeared to be in her late 20s walked over with a cordial aura around her.\n\n\"Hi, I'm looking to purchase the following ingredients. I was wondering if you have them available?\" Guy responded while handing over a paper listing a bunch of materials.\n\nThe woman took the list with both hands and read through its contents. As her eyes descended downwards, her forehead furrowed incrementally.\n\n\"May I ask what your purpose might be with these ingredients?\" she probed.\n\nGuy frowned, \"Why? You don't have them here?\"\n\nShe quickly shook her head, \"Oh no! We have them with us! It's just that you're asking for two phials of Slime Residue. As you may already know, harvesting Slime Residue is a very time consuming and complicated process. You have to nurture the slimes, feed them with biomatter of the proper type, manage their exposure to the elements, and so on. It's not just us, but even the other stores in this street will tell you the same thing. Hence we require proper verification from our customers who place an order for this material.\"\n\nThe woman followed up, \"Based on the other ingredients, I can posit that this is for making inscribing ink. Can you please produce your enchanting license?\"\n\nGuy smiled bitterly and responded, \"Actually, I'm not an enchanter. I don't have a license.\"\n\nThe woman snorted to that statement, \"Without your license, I cannot sell it to you.\"\n\n\"Is there really no other way?\" Guy pleaded.\n\n\"Ha!\" The woman scoffed. At this point, she was losing her patience. The man was clearly ill-informed and a complete novice. Just looking at the materials on the list, the woman knew that he was reaching beyond his limits. Her arrogance was fell founded, though. She was after all a Practicing Enchanter. Even though she failed her 1-star license test two times in a row, her qualifications placed her above the bumbling idiot before her.\n\n\"If you want to purchase Slime Residue without a license, then you'll have to pay a 50% mark up,\" she commented offhandedly. Slime Residue was already an expensive item worth 1 gold coin per phial, to add a 50% mark up on top of that was daylight robbery! However she didn't care, she just wanted to get rid of him, and possibly flaunt her superiority along the way.\n\nGuy frowned and contemplated on the turn of events. 'What the hell is happening? Is she looking down on me?'\n\nHe already had an estimate of the cost to purchase all the items on the list. It was well within his capacity after his most recent windfall. Even with that 50% mark up, Guy could comfortably make the purchase.\n\n'Wait a minute! This is my chance!' Guy exclaimed internally. 'Finally! After so many months, it is my opportunity to taste the high from a juicy face slap!'\n\nGuy's lips extended into his cheeks to form a sly grin. He reached into his jacket pocket to grasp his new and improved bank account token. He was preparing to pull it out flaunt the luminescent metal indicating his richness.\n\n'Time for this woman to behold this rich young master and his coffer full of gold! Hehehehe.'\n\nHowever, as his hands were about to leave the pocket, they stopped. No matter how hard Guy tried, he just couldn't pull it out and peacock his rich young master-ness.\n\nThe pocket wasn't physically obstructing him, it was something else. Something inside him. Deep inside him, his tranquil puddle of cultivation perceived a tremor. It threatened to send the environment into flux.\n\nBut the disturbance was slowly quenched, step by step, until tranquillity resumed.\n\n'I shouldn't do that... She didn't do anything wrong. It was a misunderstanding after all...' Guy started to rationalise.\n\nFinally, Guy sighed in defeat and retrieved his token, without any additional extravagance.\n\n\"I guess it was my mistake,\" Guy said in an apologetic tone. \"However I really need it, so I can't do anything but it.\"\n\nHe handed the token to the woman and added, \"Please charge it to my account. Thanks!\"\n\nThe woman held the luminescent token with an agape expression. She knew from experience that not everyone was entitled to such a high-end account from Drayden Bank. It was solely awarded to the whales, the high rollers, the nouveau riche!\n\nShe gulped to swallow the disdaining words that were on the tip of her tongue and smiled cordially once again. She was thankful that this young master wasn't vengeful and was willing to forgive her faux-pas.\n\n\"I shall pack things up immediately! Please wait for five minutes. Would you like some beverages or snacks while you wait?\" She added.\n\nGuy shook his head and took a seat inside with a smile.\n\nThe woman quickly rushed inside and returned as promised after five minutes with a wooden box help by both hands.\n\nShe carefully placed it on the table before Guy and retreated with a bow. Guy opened the container and inspected its contents while cross-referencing it against the list. After he was satisfied, he closed the box.\n\nShe then handed an invoice to obtain Guy's signature. Guy observed that on it, she hadn't added the mark up. Guy didn't want to bring it up, because he knew that the woman wanted to scrub those arrogant words from existence.\n\nGuy signed without any hesitation. She then proceeded to stamp the bank token on the invoice to leave a clear and visible imprint.\n\nGuy lifted the box and left the establishment without any further delay. But before he left, he offered his thanks to the woman and smiled politely.\n\nThe woman bowed even lower and directed Guy towards the door as a sign of respect. Once he turned the corner, the woman unwound her stressed self and sighed in relief.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-021]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":169,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 049 - (Interlude) Shady Dealings","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nA series of flat and uniform knocks interrupted the tranquil atmosphere in Goro Lynn's office. He had hoped that today would be a special day for him, free of work. Nonetheless, as the Guild Manager of Radiant City's Smithing and Enchanting Guild he could never truly escape from his responsibilities. \n\n\"Come in,\" Goro declared with a hint of lamentation in his voice.\n\nThe door opened slowly and a familiar man stepped in. Goro had intended to contact Karmin after he heard of the recent trouble the man's company was facing. Even though the two weren't close acquaintances, Goro remembered that Karmin was one of the oldest members registered to the Radiant City's guild office. Furthermore, he was also a 2-starred Smith so Goro was obligated to treat Karmin as his equal.\n\nGoro stood up from his seat and gestured at the chair opposite his desk, \"Please take a seat, Smith Zola.\"\n\nKarmin nodded and obliged.\n\n\"I was planning to contact you, however, I couldn't separate myself from my work. How is your business? I heard that you're facing some troubles. Is there anything I can do to help?\" Goro asked respectfully. While it wasn't the guild's business to interfere in the free market. Goro wanted to do anything within his power to retain Karmin amongst this branch's ranks.\n\nKarmin gently shook his head and picked up a wrapped item he brought in with him, \"I just need you to inspect this weapon for me, Enchanter Lynn.\"\n\nGoro affirmed with a hum and cleared up his desk. Karmin carefully placed the item in front of Goro and untied the string that held the cloth wrapping together. He then slowly peeled off the wrapping to reveal an impeccably crafted shortsword.\n\nGoro smiled and commented, \"I can recognise your craftsmanship! Did you reforge a Dwarven weapon? Congratulations on your success!\"\n\nKarmin interrupted Goro's gushing, \"Please inspect the weapon and its composition.\"\n\nGoro's lips twitched as he was forced to stop midway. It was an involuntary force of habit of his as a guild manager to praise his VIPs. Most enchanters and smiths of a higher rank would melt under Goro's barrage of ego-boosting drivel, but Goro forgot that Karmin wasn't one of them. The man was extremely resilient and centred!\n\nGoro coughed to clear his throat and dispel the awkward atmosphere, then he began his inspection. He didn't need to use an inspection artefact as he was sufficiently advanced in his cultivation as a mage. After all, to qualify for a 2-star license in enchanting, being in the External stage of Foundation Establishment was a minimum requirement.\n\nOn that note, Foundation Establishment is divided into three stages; Base, Internal and External stage. During each of these stages, the mages develop their mortal containers - their bodies - through cultivation, to lay the foundations for their future advancements. The vast majority of mages in the world are in this realm, in fact, those in the Mana Condensation realm aren't technically considered mages in the grand scheme of things - they're still mortals.\n\nAs Goro drew the |Inspect| cantrip into the sword, he grew increasingly satisfied and impressed by the work. There wasn't a single crack or problem point that would later manifest into a catastrophic failure through use.\n\n\"You're been extremely lucky this time, huh? No faults as far as I can see. The metal's quality is also perfect - no degradation due to reforging!\" Goro exclaimed.\n\nKarmin nodded and pulled out his own Dwarven dagger and slid it across the table, \"I want you to compare it with this dagger.\"\n\nGoro raised the dagger and commented, \"Dwarven craftsmanship, unenchanted. I'm familiar with this one.\"\n\nHe then proceeded with the inspection on the dagger, intermittently casting the cantrip on the shortsword whenever he noticed any discrepancies.\n\nAfter he finished he placed the dagger back on his desk and listed his impressions, \"They're both similar, by my inspection there is a 96% closeness in terms of the metal composition. As far as craftsmanship is concerned, the dagger is clearly the work of a Dwarven smith, while I recognise that the shortsword is your handiwork.\"\n\nHe then probed Karmin, \"Is this all? You could have just applied for an inspection from the guild's inspectors.\"\n\nKarmin exhaled deeply and produced a stack of documents from his satchel, \"Actually, I'm here for two reasons. First I want to apply for sponsoring a member for the Practitioner's Licence, AND to apply for the guild's patent on an alloy I and this member have developed.\"\n\nGoro affirmed involuntarily, but then he quickly shook his head and exclaimed, \"What?\"\n\nHe pulled the document closer and read through the sponsorship application, \"Guy Larks? Where have I heard that name before?\"\n\nRight as he wracked his brains to dig out the source of the familiar-sounding name, Karmin provided the answer, \"He's backed by Teacher Jeeves.\"\n\nGoro slapped his thighs audibly, \"Him? Which alloy did you guys develop?\"\n\nIn excitement, Goro proceeded to flip through the pages to get to the patenting applications. However, his hands paused almost immediately, \"No way! You didn't!\"\n\nHis eyes darted to the shortsword in his desk, \"You managed to create Dwarven metal?\"\n\n\"We're calling it steel. Since we don't know if it's made through the same process by the Dwarves, we felt it was best to use an alternate moniker,\" Karmin then chuckled, \"Until it is clarified by the Dwarves, of course.\"\n\nGoro shook his head in disbelief and retorted, \"How did you guys do it? No, wait! Don't tell me just yet.\"\n\n\"I wasn't planning on telling you anyways,\" Karmin responded.\n\n\"Really?\" Goro asked sheepishly, \"If you do, you might get a lot of merits from the guild. It might even be enough to put you in a favourable position for the 3-star license?\"\n\nKarmin denied once again, \"I am not planning on that. I want you to verify that this metal is a close match to Dwarven metal. My business is planning to sell steel weapons and armours soon, and I don't want people throwing around accusations of false advertising.\"\n\nGoro nodded in understanding. He already knew the shady occurrences in the markets and the rumours being tossed around regarding The Burning Forge's problems. He was required to write in a warning as a reprimand to Karmin in response to those accusations after all. But Goro also knew that Karmin wasn't one to employ subterfuge in his business dealings. He had always been above board and preached customer satisfaction. Amongst the many smiths and enchanters Goro was acquainted with, Karmin was the most personable.\n\n\"Are you planning to sell steel?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've indicated an estimate for the sale price on the application.\"\n\nGoro inspected the section and his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets, \"That is cheap! Are you sure? It's just a little higher than the price of iron!\"\n\nKarmin smiled in response, \"We've optimised its production. And besides, it was a business decision. We plan to raise its price at a later date.\"\n\nGoro understood the meaning. Right now, what Karmin needed was a stabilising factor. If this 'steel' managed to gain a foothold in the market, it would greatly improve The Burning Forge's position. And Goro was confident in this steel metal. His inspection indicated that the metal was uncannily similar to Dwarven metal.\n\nBut Goro was also worried, \"Are you sure you can handle this? Your competitors will throw a fit and pull underhanded stunts to get their hands on the alloy...\"\n\n\"And that is why I have a favour to ask of you. Don't worry, my proposition will be beneficial for both the guild and my business. I can sell steel to the guild for a highly subsidised fee, given that the guild supplies the resources for manufacturing it. In return I want the guild to regulate the market. If any other party apart from those affiliated to me and my partner venture in the steelmaking and selling market using our method, I want the guild to intervene.\"\n\nGoro showed a strained expression, \"I can't promise that. The guild doesn't interfere in the way members handle their businesses unless it conflicts with our bylaws, and you know that.\"\n\n\"Yes, however it is clearly stated in the bylaws that should a member request exclusivity of one of their intellectual properties, they are entitled to it.\"\n\n\"I get that, but -\"\n\n\"But the guild has never bothered to enforce it like the other bylaws. Why is that?\" Karmin asked pointedly.\n\n\"If an unsupported member manages to make a discovery they are never safe because they are automatically targetted by the powers above them. Without a large tree to offer them a shadow of solace, no one survives in this industry, and I empathise with that sentiment,\" Karmin continued.\n\n\"However the guild specifically indicated that the members are authorised to sole ownership rights. If that is the case then aren't you obligated to enforce it?\"\n\nKarmin sighed and spoke incisively, \"And it was only after a little bit of research, that I realised why.\"\n\nHe pulled out the third stack of documents from his satchel and spread it on Goro's desk.\n\n\"A hundred years ago, a 1-star smith developed a novel alloy of Kaminite and Orichalcum that was perfect for channelling lightning-aligned mana. They applied for a sole ownership right, and the guild approved it. However, a month after, the smith was found dead in his forge. Many thought the alloy would die with the smith, but three weeks after the incident, the guild started to sell this new alloy.\"\n\nKarmin dragged another file and added, \"73 years ago, a 2-star smith developed an improved method of producing the standard Adamantium metal. Yadda yadda, the smith was found dead in a brothel and a month after that, the guild implemented this new system into their production lines.\"\n\n\"The guild wasn't involved in those events!\" Goro denied vehemently.\n\nKarmin hummed in condescension and pulled out specific pages from eight different folders, \"Once or twice, is a coincidence. But if the pattern persists for 8 different cases? I know, nothing is tying the guild to these incidences on paper, but I've done my investigation. I suggest you take a closer look.\"\n\nKarmin waited for Goro to peruse through the information as he slid deeper into his seat confidently.\n\nGoro was sweating through his clothes at this point. Putting on a facade of confidence he asked, \"Are you threatening the guild?\"\n\nKarmin nodded innocently, \"Yes. I thought I was clear.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Goro asked through clenched teeth.\n\n\"I don't want YOU to do anything. I want to meet the ones above you.\" Karmin declared as he stood up to leave.\n\n\"Oh and if people somehow find my or my partner's dead body in the coming weeks, know that I will make sure this information reaches the ears of all the guild members in Gaea! I will take the guild down with me. Of course, you wouldn't mess with Guy Larks, unless you're planning to cross Al Jeeves too. This isn't my first rodeo, Goro.\"\n\nGoro sighed, \"Since when have you known?\"\n\n\"Please! I knew it since the day I got my practitioner's license,\" Karmin said nonchalantly as he strode out of the office.\n\nGoro dabbed his forehead with his sleeves and calmed himself. He reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a communication artefact. He had activated the artefact the moment Karmin brought forward the sole ownership request. In fact, that sentence was like an activation phrase for the guild managers, 'If anyone asks for sole ownership, activate the communication artefact to your branch handler in HQ!'\n\n\"What do I do?\" he asked.\n\nThe artefact strobed slightly, and a sharp and feminine voice responded, \"Let me think about it...\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-050]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":170,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 048 - Coincidental Source of Income","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nThe last time Guy accessed Karmin's personal inventory, he had taken a cursory glance at the contents, especially at the items he recognised from his old world. One of the items he took notice of was a container filled with yellow powder. While he had a gist of what it was, he wasn't confident in recognising it at first glance. But after taking a pinch of it in his hands and combusting it, he immediately confirmed its identity through its blue flame.\n\n\"Sulfur!\" Guy declared as he carefully lifted a glass container and scooped up a decent amount of the substance. On his way out, he fetched a few more containers that were sturdy and could sustain higher pressures.\n\nHe then brought them out of the inventory and moved towards a stable working platform in Karmin's workshop. All the while Karmin unflinchingly observed Guy's actions.\n\nMost high-school chemistry courses covered the topic of reversible chemical reactions. These are special chemical processes in which the system, defined as the sole mixture of reactants and products, is in a constant flux of forward and reverse reaction - the making and breaking of products. This is opposed to regular chemical reactions in which the process is monodirectional and it is impossible to obtain the reactants from the products.\n\nIn this topic, students are forced to learn two case studies on reversible reactions and manipulating the equilibrium of these systems: the Haber process, and the Contact process. These case studies are so common that most chemistry teachers, even those that have retired, can recite them from memory without missing a beat.\n\nThe former was named after a Nobel Prize-winning Polish scientist who developed a method to efficiently produce ammonia. That chemical had two faces, it is a key component in fertilisers and explosives. Interestingly, Fritz Haber, the namesake behind the reaction, intended to use it to ramp up Germany's offensive efforts in World War 1.\n\nThe second case study, the Contact process, defined a strategy to synthesise sulfuric acid from sulfur, and this was what Guy was aiming for.\n\nBefore he began, Guy pondered for a while and formulated a set of spells that would fit his needs coming forward. He didn't want to flounder around midway through the reaction and screw up the entire process.\n\nAfter he was satisfied with his preparation, he brought the sulfur into a closed container and combusted it with excess oxygen. The output of this reaction was sulfur dioxide. After he verified the gaseous contents of the container, he used another spell mixed with the cantrip |Inspect| to carefully remove all the other gases from the container except for sulfur dioxide.\n\nOnce done, he channelled another spell to bring oxygen into the mixture. Using |Inspect| he made sure that the ratio of sulfur dioxide to oxygen was 2:1. He then used two alternating spells to both slowly lower the temperature inside the container as well as ramping up the pressure by forcefully bringing the gases closer together. This was because lowering temperature and increasing pressure favoured the forward reaction that formed the sulfur trioxide product.\n\nThe temperature modulating spell wasn't draining, however, the pressure spell started to eat up a lot of his mana very quickly. Noticing this, Guy decided to act preemptively and pulled out the forming sulfur trioxide from the mixture using a strained third spell.\n\nHe then directed this gas into a container of pure water and let the two react. By removing the product from the equilibrium reaction, the reaction between sulfur dioxide and oxygen accelerated.\n\nAfter a few more minutes, the gaseous contents of the container were depleted, and Guy was left with a container of highly concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\nHe then proceeded to dilute the acid and tested it by dropping a sliver of steel residue from Karmin's forge. He observed whether the test metal dissolved in the acid, and further diluted it till he was satisfied.\n\nOnce Guy finished, he transferred the dilute acid to a longer container which sufficient diameter to hold the forged sword and gestured Karmin to submerge it in.\n\nAll the while Guy was performing his magic, Karmin was watching the performance with an engrossed expression.\n\nKarmin followed Guy's instructions and lowered the sword in till the liquid reached the hilt area, leaving the handle region exposed.\n\nThe two then waited for 10 minutes and pulled out the sword from the acid. Guy proceeded to clean up the sword with a wash of water and quickly dried it.\n\nAs the water droplets evaporated from the surface, Guy saw a familiar texture emerging. Although it wasn't as distinctive as with the Dwarven weapons, it was noticeable and close enough.\n\nKarmin slowly approached the sword and caressed it with a shaking hand.\n\n\"It's... It's... We did it!\" He muttered under his breath while lifting the sword into the light.\n\n____\n\nEven though Karmin was a bit shaken after achieving his goal, that too in such a trivial manner, he didn't trudge around in a daze. He still had to finish up the sword by adding its guard and grip. Since it was a shortsword, he didn't have to forge an intricate guard, so he resolved to use one that was a part of the grip itself. He made the part out of wood and carefully wrapped it in a mix of cloth and soft leather. Due to his proficiency, this process didn't take a long time.\n\nAfter he was finished he placed the weapon on a table rack and admired it in its entirety. Working with Dwarven metal was a dream of every smith. However, due to the scarcity of the metal, they had to settle by melting existing Dwarven craftsmanship. This wasn't as easy as working with other metals because it was kind of like gambling. There was never a guarantee that the reforged weapon or armour would survive the quenching process. If there were cracks or failures, then the smith had to melt it again and reforge the item once more. Each reforging process would take a toll on the metal and would diminish its quality.\n\nMost smiths would perform months worth of preparation and archaic ceremonies to increase their probabilities of success when attempting reforging with Dwarven metal.\n\nHowever, Karmin was elated at the prospect of observing the innovative methods and optimisations provided by Guy. Not only had he managed to replicate Dwarven metal or steel, but he had also implemented a strategy that improved the probability of successful forging. These techniques would be worth a fortune. Most smithing clans would pass down these methods to their younger generation, and guard them close to their hearts.\n\nGuy just straight up gave it to Karmin for free!\n\nKarmin didn't know if Guy was a gullible fool or a charitable and kind man. Actually, Karmin wasn't interested in verifying it either. After experiencing betrayal, he wasn't prepared to open himself up just yet. He was grateful to Guy, but he wasn't of a mind to establish a relationship built on loyalty.\n\nAnd so, Karmin ran some numbers in his head and spoke up, \"I owe you an immense debt of gratitude, Teaching Apprentice Larks!\"\n\nGuy quickly waved his hands and replied, \"Please don't say that! I can't offer much in return for your gracious help in letting me practice gem inscription. Consider this as me repaying your kindness.\"\n\nKarmin shook his head, \"I can't accept that. I'm sure you realise the magnitude of the information you've provided me. This will shake up the market drastically! You say that you're repaying my kindness, but the balance is tilting heavily in your favour.\"\n\nGuy smiled wryly and retorted, \"You don't have to evaluate it like that...\"\n\n\"I know that it sounds crass and blunt, but I can only do it this way given my recent experiences. I hope you understand,\" Karmin clarified in a serious tone. He then continued, \"Even though you've offered this technique to The Burning Forge, I am hereby establishing this venture as a partnership. Since you aren't registered with the Smithing and Enchanting Guild, it will be harder, but I'm planning to send in a recommendation that will automatically qualify you for a Practitioning Smithing License. This way, I can register this alloy under your and my name with the guild.\"\n\n\"You can do that?\"\n\nKarmin nodded and clarified, \"There are two methods to gaining the Practitioning Smithing License. The first is by passing the guild's assessment. The other is by getting a recommendation from a guild registered smith with a minimum of 1-star. In the latter case, the sponsor must provide assurances about the individual's experience, but you don't have to worry about all that.\"\n\nKarmin cleaned his hands and pulled out a roll of paper, quill and ink from under his work desk and started writing, \"I am going to write up an informal contract, which I will formalise at a later date and get notarised by the Guild. Since your contribution was instrumental to the development of the new alloy, henceforth called 'Steel', it entitles you to a larger portion of the profits gained from its sale. However, since it was largely dependent on my contribution and work, I believe that I also qualify for an equal share. Any objections?\"\n\nGuy shook his head.\n\n\"In that case, how does a 40% share in the sale of steel ingots, and 20% share in the sale of steel weapons and armours sound to you. Since I will be the one providing the raw materials and labour, I believe the percentage is fair. This only applies to sales made through The Burning Forge. If the formula for making steel is to be distributed it will require your verification as well, and in that case, you will have to get involved in negotiating your stake. On that note, I hope that this method remains exclusive with The Burning Forge...\"\n\nThe last part was more of a demand than a request, and Guy knew that. Hearing the long tirade filled with legal jargon caused Guy's palms to sweat up.\n\n\"It sounds fair to me...\" Guy affirmed in a low voice.\n\nFollowing that, Karmin went on to discuss various conditions, loopholes and provisions to account for a variety of scenarios and possible trends in the future.\n\nThe whole process extended deep into the night!\n\nAt that point, Guy inwardly applauded Karmin's capabilities and foresight as a businessman. Not many people would draw up such a thorough contract for a business deal in this world. Mostly it was an assumed agreement. Guy reckoned that once bitten twice shy, Karmin had definitely become more cautious in his dealings.\n\n'He'll thrive back on Earth!' Guy chuckled in admiration.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-049]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":171,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 047 - Making a Steel Weapon","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n\"What is this spell?\" Karmin asked as he inspected the novel diagram scrawled in white.\n\nGuy used the ritual drawing chalk from his teaching supplied to draw a spell on the two working bellows. The school supplied chalk could at best support Tier-1 and a few Tier-2 spells. In order to reach the higher tiers, specialised chalk with spell-specific ingredients would be required. But for augmenting steelmaking, Guy figured these would do.\n\nThe spell he was drawing had one simple purpose: to concentrate oxygen flowing through the bellows. It was the best he could do. Steelmaking in the modern age was a highly optimised and complicated process. It wasn't something that any average Joe could recite off the top of their heads. Furthermore, he was just a teacher in his previous life. While he did know some of the mechanisms involved, he couldn't draw up a steelmaking set-up with confidence.\n\nThrough general knowledge, Guy knew that in order to increase the purity of steel, they needed to blast in a lot of oxygen into the molten mixture. The gas would oxidise the impurities in the mixture and separate them into slag. However, he couldn't scrounge up a mechanism to infuse oxygen into the blast furnace. Therefore, he resolved to jury-rig the set-up.\n\nNow, when the bellows were operated, when it pulled in air, the ritual ensured that only oxygen was captured. While this wouldn't reduce the effort they'd have to employ in running the bellows, it would greatly reduce the amount of time they'd need to run it. On that note, since Guy was using his modular spellmaking method, he deduced that the mana consumption would be low as well.\n\nOnce Guy finished drawing the spells, he took a step back and inspected his handiwork.\n\n\"This should improve our work,\" he muttered.\n\n\"How many mana crystals would they need to work?\" Karmin asked apprehensively. Although he still had a lot of assets, he didn't want to splurge unnecessarily.\n\n\"Not much, I don't think. I can probably run my bellow without crystals,\" Guy concluded, causing Karmin's eyes to widen in shock.\n\nJust as he was about to probe Guy further, the man snapped his fingers and exclaimed, \"Right! Mister Zola, do you happen to have limestone?\"\n\nKarmin nodded his head and pointed towards the corner of the room. The material was commonplace in foundries and forges for its ability to treat the raw ore. It would also be used during forging to reduce the formation of flux.\n\nGuy walked over and retrieved the sack of limestone and placed it near the now cold blast furnace.\n\n\"Why don't we try it again?\" Guy asked.\n\n____\n\nThe two got to work immediately. Karmin handled the start-up as usual - feeding the blast furnace a predetermined ratio of coke to iron. He observed the internals until he ascertained that they had reached the melting point.\n\n\"Ready,\" Karmin indicated and started to work his bellow. Unlike before, he now had a stack of crystals next to the bellow and a pedestal placed close to the ritual. The pedestal acted as a battery and would drain any crystals placed in it to power the ritual it was connected to.\n\nAs the ritual initiated, the chalk diagram lit up and turned corporeal. Karmin didn't notice any difference in the operation, but he could observe that the temperature within the furnace had risen significantly.\n\nKarmin paced himself this time and rotated his wheel at a steady rate. He observed that Guy would intermittently levitate a handful of limestone dust and pour it through a tap hole near the top of the furnace.\n\nThe process continued for around an hour, with Karmin taking a break regularly to massage his aching arms. Every time he took a rest, Karmin would check the number of crystals used. Surprisingly, he had barely run through the first low-grade crystal. He wondered if the ritual was some form of placebo to encourage him...\n\n\"It's done!\" Guy suddenly exclaimed.\n\nKarmin jumped excitedly in anticipation. He attached a tap at the bottom of the furnace and started to carefully pour out its contents. As he observed the molten liquid drip through, his hands started to jitter in elation.\n\n'We finally did it!'\n\nEven if it was still in a red hot and molten state, Karmin could make out that the metal was far superior this time. He didn't know if he had perfectly replicated Dwarven metal, but whatever this thing was, it was close!\n\nOnce the metal cooled down completely, Karmin moved his fingers over the ingots. He caressed the steel in earnest; his mind started to churn as inspiration boiled over\n\nTo Guy, Karmin looked possessed! And just like someone consumed by passion, he grasped the ingot of steel with a set of tongs and moved them over to his personal forge.\n\nHis hands moved familiarly, stoking the flamed to his required temperature, positioning the anvil, he was utterly involved in the process.\n\nHe shoved the ingot into the flame and waited; his eyes trained on the metal observing every minute change in its shade. After a pause, he quickly pulled it out and hammered it.\n\nCLANG!\n\nCLANG!\n\nCLANG!\n\nThe cold hammer struck the hot metal rhythmically, sending sparks flying in the process. Following each strike, Karmin would slightly shift and reposition the ingot.\n\nThe ingot extended slowly, turning into a flat billet. He then heated the billet and used a set of tools to slice it into equally sized pieces. He then placed the pieces on top of each other, sprinkled limestone on the stack, and sent it back into the forge to weld them together.\n\nHe let the stack merge together and repeated the extruding process.\n\nGuy observed Karmin, as he moulded a drab ingot of steel into a magnificent shortsword. Even though it was yet to undergo the finishing touches, Guy could already imagine the wonderful work of craftsmanship in action.\n\nJust a Karmin was about to dip the sword into a water bath to quench it, Guy interrupted him, \"WAIT!\"\n\nThe shout pulled Karmin out of his trance, and he looked at Guy with a hint of confusion and annoyance.\n\n\"You shouldn't quench steel in water. I just remembered, do you happen to have oil?\" Guy followed up quickly.\n\nKarmin nodded and instructed Guy towards his workshop's storage room.\n\nGuy rushed in and brought over a bucket filled with oil. He placed it near Karmin and conjured a spell to heat the oil to just below boiling point.\n\n\"OK, now go ahead and quench it in here,\" Guy instructed while stepping back.\n\nKarmin did as told and lowered the sword into the bucket. While doing so, he asked, \"Why are we using oil?\"\n\nGuy scratched his head and spoke, \"Ï remembered that it has something to do with the molecular structure and the presence of carbon in the alloy...\"\n\nWhile there was truth in that confession, Guy had lied out of embarrassment. Again, he confessed that he wasn't a metallurgist or a seasoned blacksmith in his old world. Everything he accomplished today was through mixing and matching knowledge he had in his RoK and his mind with the experience Karmin had over his years of work. He hadn't performed anything revolutionary or groundbreaking in terms of technology in this world. He just tweaked things and implemented optimisations to the process. The whole idea of quenching using oil was something Guy recollected from a bunch of videos he watched on a streaming platform. One time, when he was bored, he unknowingly stumbled down a rabbit hole of forging videos where the uploaders created different weapons and trinkets in their backyards. Although it wasn't anything special, Guy found those videos strangely soothing. Karmin's harmonious hammering sort of triggered one of Guy's memories.\n\nKarmin didn't understand anything Guy uttered, but he was knowledgeable enough to make inferences through observation. When he retrieved the metal from the oil bath, he didn't observe any failure points. Quenching was always the worst part of forging, it usually determined whether the attempt was successful - it was a make-or-break step for all blacksmiths. Karmin figured that he could later test out the implications of using hot oil over regular water to quench steel weapons and document them.\n\nHe then took a closer look at the sword and brought it over to the grindstone. He familiarly worked the apparatus. However, he quickly found out that he could not stand close to the weapon as it was being sharpened. This new metal seemed to produce a lot of sparks as it was being worked, much more than any other metal he had experience with.\n\nGuy chimed in, \"Steel tends to do that. The carbon in the alloy produces sparks as it heats up due to friction.\"\n\nKarmin nodded and smiled, \"This is a good sign! The Dwarven dagger also produced similar sparks the last time I sharpened it!\"\n\nWith reinvigorated excitement, Karmin commenced sharpening the weapon. After the first run, he moved over to a work table and used another grindstone with a higher grit. He repeated the process until he reached the finishing stone with the highest grit.\n\nOne finished, Karmin beheld his work from a distance. At first, he was immensely delighted with his new weapon, but his smile started to fade slowly and expressed a hint of disappointment.\n\nGuy noticed this change and carefully probed, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"It's a shame that it doesn't have the same patterns,\" he replied.\n\n\"That's because you can't see it yet. Hold on, I'll show you!\" Guy shouted as he rushed back into the storage room, leaving an astounded Karmin behind.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-048]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":172,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 046 - Blast It!","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy and Karmin left for The Burning Forge's head office two days after their last meeting. Guy anticipated a long journey by road and had packed sufficient items to last him during the travel. However, contrary to his expectations, the journey from Radiant City to their destination lasted less than an hour.\n\n\"There's a teleportation ritual connecting your showroom to your head office!\" Guy exclaimed as Karmin led him into a room concealed behind the back wall of the shop's storage.\n\nGuy tended to forget just how big of a deal Karmin and his business was. The man was clearly loaded to be able to set up such an expensive ritual connecting his facilities together. In fact, transporting sentient beings was many times harder and costlier than inanimate objects.\n\nNo one really knows the exact mechanisms behind how these teleportation rituals work. If an object is to be moved from one point to another, once it is transported to its destination, does the object remain the same or is it a copy of the original. Are we essentially disintegrating the original, transporting it through obscure means to the destination, and reconstructing it again? Or are we creating an exact copy of the object at the destination and deleting the original? \n\nIn this case, what if the object was sentient and had a will? Would the reconstruction or the copy at the destination maintain the properties of the being at the origin?\n\nAnother school of thought surmises that it is space and time which is being affected while the object remains stationary. This would alleviate the concerns posed by the former theories since the sentient being isn't affected, just their environment. But this concept opens up another can of worms regarding the stability and safety of affecting the fabric of reality.\n\nMany mages had pondered on this thought for years on end, and each of them had their unique interpretation on the topic. Which one was right? That didn't matter since their interpretations resonated with them and meshed with their cultivation in some way.\n\nNonetheless, the truth remained that setting up these teleportation rituals wasn't something any Tom, Dick or Harry could achieve. First off, the spell formation for this ritual was immensely intricate, and well beyond the limits of comprehension of any Foundation Establishment mage. Secondly, the act of teleportation itself was resource-heavy, in that it required a large amount of mana. So, anyone that wanted to use it would have to feed the ritual a lot of high-grade mana crystals.\n\n\"All of the company's branches are linked to the head office. Besides, this is a safer mode of transit as there are fewer eyes following us,\" Karmin nodded as he cleared up the ritual's space and placed the mana crystals in its vicinity.\n\nGuy scrunched his eyes as he tried to follow the spell formation drawn on the platform in the centre of the room. He quickly realised his presumptuousness. Just because he had managed to simplify a bunch of Tier-1 and a few Tier-2 spells didn't mean that he could reach multiple levels beyond his capacity.\n\nIt was already established that spells and rituals were classified by tiers. Tier-1 spells were within the reach of Middle to Late stage Mana Condensation realm mages. Tier-2 to Tier-4 were within Foundation Establishment mages' capacity. The teleportation spell could be classified as a Tier-5 or Tier-6 spell depending on its mechanism.\n\n\"Alright! Ready?\" Karmin asked while stepping onto the centre of the platform.\n\nGuy snapped out of his trance and followed Karmin. Once the two were situated within the inner circle of the ritual, Karmin activated it by impressing a small drop of his mana on a token in his palm. Within seconds, the faded ritual on the floor lit up and a corporeal outline started to rise. Once the outline reached level with Guy's hips, it started to rotate with increasing velocity. From that point, as it ascended higher, Guy observed his surroundings change into a blur. Right as the outline passed over his head, the background settled into a completely different sight.\n\nGuy struggled to maintain his composure after the teleportation ritual concluded. Compared to the space-warping type teleportation Al performed, this one felt much more unsettling. His head ached and his gut felt like it was about to burst. Guy stumbled slightly, and then lowered his body into a squat to stabilise himself.\n\n\"Teleportation sickness... You'll get used to it,\" Karmin commented and walked towards a table in this new room and poured a glass of water.\n\nGuy took the glass and drank the fluid in large gulps.\n\nIt took him another minute to fully overcome the disorientation. But they couldn't afford to waste time so Guy shook it off as he followed Karmin through the hallways.\n\nEven though they hadn't exited this new facility, Guy could already make out that it was probably a large and sprawling structure. The hallways were long and grand, with a lot of natural light entering through the wide windows. It followed a similar architectural style to Radiant City, with elegant marble pillars adorned with The Burning Forge's symbol at its base and tip.\n\nSurprisingly, the facility was eerily quiet.\n\n\"There don't seem to be a lot of people here today,\" Guy probed carefully.\n\nKarmin smiled ruefully and replied, \"We're working with a barebones crew at the moment. The situation in the market is... less than satisfactory.\"\n\nGuy nodded and followed Karmin in silence. He knew better than to poke a downed man. He recognised that The Burning Forge was like Karmin's baby, and he probably wasn't eager to see it meet a tragic end.\n\nThe duo travelled downwards from the teleportation room and arrived at a small yet highly functional workshop. It was more compact compared to the one Guy saw back at the shop. There was only one regular-sized forge, with a lot of tools and set-ups which were of much higher quality.\n\n\"This is my personal workspace!\" Karmin declared as he opened up the windows and exhaust in the room, allowing natural light to flood in.\n\nKarmin then directed Guy to a haphazard section of the room which opened up outside the building. In it, Guy saw a physical representation of the steelmaking set-up Karmin alluded to in his journal.\n\nIt stood out like a sore thumb amongst the more hi-tech units in his workshop, clearly indicating that it was most likely a relic of one of his old experimentations.\n\n\"We should probably get started, huh?\" Karmin pointed out as he tossed over an apron and rolled up his sleeves.\n\n____\n\nKarmin had altered his original blast furnace following Guy's advice. It could now accommodate three bellows on its sides.\n\nHe first poured in a calculated amount of Ashen Coal, or coke, and ingots of iron. He had determined these ratios through his earlier trials in replicating Dwarven metal. However, he recognised that coke had a higher concentration of carbon and so he tweaked it accordingly.\n\nAfter lighting the coal, he closed the blast furnace and allowed it to heat up. Through his intuition, Karmin could recognise the temperature inside the furnace simply by observing the colour. This ability had been cultivated over years of work in the forge.\n\nOnce he determined that the blast furnace had reached the temperature to melt iron, he gestured at Guy to assume his position next to one of the bellows.\n\nThe bellows operated through a marriage of gears. The user had to turn a wheel, and through commutation, the bellows would move up and down. Although this had greatly decreased the amount of physical effort required by the worker, it was still a strenuous task. Guy could persist longer due to his young age and superior endurance from his cultivation, however, Karmin could not.\n\nAnd so, after half an hour of strenuous driving, Karmin slumped onto the ground while wheezing.\n\n\"I regret sending everyone home,\" He lamented through heavy breaths. He didn't want the information regarding his experimentation to leak out. After being backstabbed by someone he considered a close friend, Karmin was having a hard time trusting other people. And so he didn't want to take any risks.\n\n\"How is it inside?\" He asked Guy. Usually, Karmin would operate an inspection artefact, which was a standard enchanted tool used by smiths and enchanters. Since |Inspect| was a basic cantrip, anyone could use it. However, mortals could at most cast it once every hour with their measly mana capacity. The inspection artefact leveraged a mana gem's ability to hold mana to cast the cantrip. Eventually, it became a common item in every craftsman's toolbox.\n\nHowever, with a capable mage present, Karmin didn't feel like trudging over and fetching the tool.\n\nGuy directed his cantrip into the blast furnace and inspected the molten alloy.\n\nAfter half a minute, he pursed his lips and shook his head in dismay, \"Not quite there yet. We still need to refine it further. The impurities haven't been fully separated.\"\n\nKarmin groaned as he rolled over onto his stomach.\n\n\"This will take ages!\" He exclaimed. \"Is there any magic that can speed this up?\" He asked in defeat.\n\nWhen he heard that, Guy audibly slapped his face in embarrassment, 'Why didn't I think of that!'\n\n\"I might have a solution!\" Guy answered while walking over to his satchel.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-047]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":173,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 045 - That's a Steel","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nAs he faced Karmin's confused yet elated gaze, Guy realised something. Proper steel didn't exist in this world. \n\nAt first, it sounded implausible. Considering how 5000 years had passed since the Age of Isolation at least one ancient mage powerhouse should have derived the exact formula for making the steel alloy. Alternatively, there were so many smiths registered to the guild, at least one of them should have determined the formula by now.\n\nBut it was after considering it for a while that Guy recognised a key fact. And in fact, Mast had brought this up many times after plopping Guy into this world.\n\nTechnological and ideological advancement in this world had stagnated. Any growth made was incremental at best, and mostly applied to the higher rungs of the power ladder. It made sense. A per cent increase in the pinnacle would be more significant as opposed to a per cent increase amongst mortals.\n\nGuy envisioned this scenario as a house that was prone to flooding. Each year the water level would rise and drown the house's floor. However, instead of fixing the situation and elevating the house, the inhabitants found it reasonable to raise the ceiling incrementally. In the end, they'd have a magnificent house, akin to a mansion, but one that would be fully submerged during flooding season.\n\nIn the case of smithing, everyone recognised the superiority of Dwarven Metal, or steel, but they found it unnecessary to replicate it. Why? Because although the gap between regular iron and steel was vast, it could be bridged by using a different metal alloy that had similar properties to steel. The people in Gaea found this alternative cheaper than pursuing rigorous research in weedling out steel's formula. That, and with the presence of mana metals, people felt that it wouldn't be economical to tweak iron in any way and improve it.\n\nEven with |Inspect| the smiths were constantly stumped by how iron could be mixed with a nonmetallic substance and purified to such an extent. Many tried and failed in the process. Over time people gave up and wrote it off as a metal naturally found in the Fel realm.\n\nKarmin produced some of the journals from his youth, which documented his works in replicating steel. In it, he talked about how he applied various strategies in getting the composition right. Trying alternative metals in the mixture, changing up the foundry and experimenting with modified strategies in heating the ores. He included his failures and possible alternatives to pursue. But he too had quickly dropped the idea after hitting multiple roadblocks. Deep down he was also a businessman - he wasn't going to waste time on something with a bleak chance of success.\n\nGuy sighed as he placed the journal back on the desk. He started to appreciate the tenacity of the people from Earth. With hard limits on their capabilities, humans had to push their minds to unimaginable limits. What they had accomplished in 4000 years in his old world far exceeded the advancements achieved by humans in this world in double the time.\n\n'Does magic make people lazier and stupider? That actually makes sense! Why else would people go out of their way to set themselves up just to get dunked on by cheat characters like Jo Way?' Apparently, Guy was still salty about the whole deal with Jo Way.\n\n\"It's not just me, actually. I referred to a lot of journals about people attempting to replicate Dwarven metal. All of them get stuck one way or another in trying to mix the nonmetallic substance with iron and purifying it further,\" Karmin commented. After that, he leaned forward and probed, \"You called it steel? Are you familiar with this metal?\"\n\nGuy nodded apprehensively and replied, \"You could say that. I know the gist of how it's created. However, as you already know I'm not really an expert in metallurgy. I can't give you a definitive and exact methodology.\"\n\nThat was the truth! Guy never had to memorise the composition of steel and the way it was made. There were some books in the RoK that offered information on that topic, however, they were only up to the middle school level. To gain access to the more advanced books Guy would need to scrounge up four more students out of nowhere.\n\nKarmin wasn't completely convinced after hearing Guy's answer, though. More knowledgeable people had tried to recreate the Dwarven metal, he didn't have confidence that a random teaching apprentice would be able to succeed where they failed. \n\nAlthough, a small part of him wanted to believe in Guy. After all, he did have Teacher Jeeves' backing.\n\n\"You were quite close. What you made through your trials was pig iron, which is basically iron with a very high carbon content -\"\n\n\"Carbon?\" Karmin interrupted.\n\n\"That's the nonmetal present in the Dwarven metal. It increases the hardness of the iron, but it also decreases its malleability. Anyways, what you're missing are a few additional steps to refine the iron and the steel, and you would have succeeded,\" Guy commented as he pointed out specific sections in Karmin's journal.\n\n\"Regarding this... carbon. The mages I've referred to for inspecting the metal all alluded to it being present in coal. Is that what you're alluding to?\" Karmin asked.\n\n\"Yes, coal is mostly comprised of carbon. There are other elements present in it of course, which is also something that affects the purity of the pig iron you created. It would be better if you used fuel with higher carbon content and lower impurities.\"\n\n\"Ah! Ashen Coal might work!\" Karmin exclaimed.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's like coal, except it's much harder and porous,\" Karmin clarified.\n\n\"Oh, so it's something like coke?\"\n\n\"What are all these word's you're using?\" Karmin retorted in exasperation.\n\nSteel, coke, carbon, pig iron... All of those words sounded completely foreign to Karmin. If it weren't for Guy's serious demeanour, Karmin could have sworn that the man was pulling his legs.\n\n\"Forget it! You seem to have some knowledge about the process, explain it to me in detail,\" Karmin demanded.\n\nGuy nodded and started to explain the basic principles of steelmaking to the best of his abilities. His knowledge was only perfunctory, but with the assistance of some of the books in the RoK, he could extrapolate key details about the process. He didn't extend beyond his limits, and thankfully he didn't have to. Karmin was knowledgeable and very quickly grasped the concepts as Guy unveiled them. He could even provide suggestions derived from his own experiences. The expertise of a 2-star smith was nothing to scoff at after all.\n\nOne thing Karmin found difficult to tackle was the scientific explanations surrounding some of the steps in steelmaking. He wasn't informed about oxidation of impurities, or what oxygen was in general. However, he had an intuition about its purpose. Publications on smithing and forging often described similar processes, nevertheless, they relied heavily on the craftsman's instincts and experience.\n\nThat is why most smiths start as apprentices. During those stages, they are forced to learn the craft by observing their teachers and learning through demonstration. The disadvantages of this process are obvious, not only do these apprentices not know the purpose behind certain decisions they are also liable to learn poor habits and quirks employed by their teachers - which may be propagated through their own apprentices in the future.\n\nIf someone asked the apprentice why a certain step was employed, they wouldn't be able to vocalise the reason. \"That's just the way you have to do it!\" they'd confess after struggling to voice an explanation.\n\nAs a result, Karmin was quickly frustrated by the purification stages Guy described.\n\n\"All of this seems quite advanced. Where did you learn this?\"\n\nGuy's left eye twitched as he heard that question - the damn thing almost triggered his PTSD. Now, Guy had come to terms with the practicality of his alternate self. So without even a second of doubt, he regressed into the RoK and put on the mask.\n\n\"It was a revelation!\" He began, as his consciousness stabilised.\n\nGuy didn't want to come off as a complete lunatic and off-the-hook crazy. After practising rigorously with the mask on, he had figured out a way to exactly tune his zealousness in this state.\n\nThus, he began preaching his pieces. Going on about how he was shown visions of a world devoid of magic - The True World. He made sure to tailor this \"sermon\" for a craftsman such as Karmin. The topics he veered towards were all relevant to blacksmithing, metallurgy and craftsmanship. He also reared in some of his outrageous claims to not scare Karmin away.\n\nSurprisingly though, Karmin wasn't as averse to these preachings as Guy had thought. He was actively listening and providing appropriate reactions at the correct times. He showed surprise when Guy discussed the different versions of steel with varying carbon content and their uses. He exhibited confusion when Guy described the automation of processes through industrialisation. He was genuinely enraptured by the many absurd inventions that were borne of necessity due to the lack of magic. \n\nAfter a point, Karmin was a little embarrassed as he couldn't keep up. He didn't understand or was unable to envision some of the claims presented by Guy. Of course, he didn't disbelieve them - the concepts sounded logical and implementable. Just that his mind couldn't connect a few dots - he had to test them out. And so, he quickly brought the discussion back to steelmaking with an audible cough.\n\n\"*cough* I guess that makes sense?\" He then continued, \"I think this warrants another trial. Good thing I didn't demolish my Dwarven metal, no! Steelmaking set-up. If you've free the day after tomorrow, why don't you come over to my personal workshop? Meet me here at noon and we'll leave together. I will need your assistance setting up the subsequent stages following the creation of pig iron.\"\n\nGuy nodded and retrieved his original consciousness by taking off the mask.\n\n\"I guess that's another thing on my plate now...\" he grumbled as he left The Burning Forge.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-046]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":174,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 044 - Price of Complacency","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nAs Guy listened to Karmin's heartfelt explanation of the recent misfortune that befell his business, the frown on his face deepened. \n\n\"Oh, Jo Way...\" He sighed.\n\nThat's right! It all boiled down to that one incident when Jo Way publicly pointed out the fault in the sword on display. Although Karmin managed to alleviate the immediate chatter that lingered following the hubbub, there were inevitably eyes and ears belonging to his competitors lurking in the vicinity. These agents managed to grasp the crux of the matter and propagated rumours and blown up lies about The Burning Forge's products. They even managed to root out some old customers with similarly diluted weapons and armours and brought them into the forefront.\n\nSince The Burning Forge was a veritable powerhouse in the market, the attack shouldn't have been so effective. However, taking out the alpha was a tempting offer for the many betas lurking in its shadows. Furthermore, it wasn't as if The Burning Forge was free of any equally strong competitors. The Bori Clan also happened to have a foothold in the smithing and enchanting industry. They knew that Karmin was looking to expand into their territory. Luckily for them, Gaige's father had dispatched his own agent to follow Jo Way, to gain a deeper understanding of his character. Therefore, the whole spectacle was observed by the agent and transmitted to the clan head.\n\nThe attack on The Burning Forge's business was highly coordinated and multi-pronged. The minor players chipped away at the business' existing base by unearthing minute faults and errors and creating an intricate web of lies insinuating that Karmin was embezzling and implementing fraudulent business practices. The loyal customer base was quickly shaken with these whispers, slowly diminishing the business' revenues.\n\nThe Bori clan went straight for the throat. They attacked the whales affiliated with the business. The clients who usually placed large orders regularly. The Kraven Mercenary Corp, the client that ordered those enchanted swords, was one of those whales.\n\nSo it was needless to say that The Burning Forge was in a precarious position. Revenues were down, the business held an abysmal rating amongst the population, and their assets were being lost through physical and financial attacks. Furthermore, unlike the Bori Clan, The Burning Forge did not have any ancestors or hidden experts to rely on in case of crises.\n\nGuy smiled wryly at the sheer destruction that followed Jo Way. The man spoke only a few words, and he completely destroyed a monolith with decades' worth of foundation.\n\n\"I can't really blame that man. It was my own complacency that wrought all of this,\" Karmin lamented.\n\nIn many ways, it was true. Jo wasn't the one responsible for all of this. He wasn't obligated to keep his lips sealed after observing mistakes or issues in the products being purchased. Even in Guy's old world, it was a common occurrence for customers to sue companies for false advertising, misrepresentation, personal harm, and so on. It was their right as a consumer to do so.\n\nSure, some people would file seemingly nonsensical lawsuits to take advantage of certain omissions in the product or service's usage documentation or terms of services. For instance, take-away drink cups to hold hot beverages had to specifically indicate that its contents are hot, just because of a lawsuit filed by an old woman who suffered third-degree burns from spilt coffee from a fast-food franchise. For many, this may seem like a case of a lapse in common sense from the consumer's side, however, multiple facets to it warrant discussion.\n\nFirst, although that customer \"should\" know that coffee is hot, the issue was that in that particular case, the temperature of the liquid was well beyond the ideal coffee drinking temperature. It was much higher than the threshold wherein the liquid could burn you within half a second of contact. Therefore, it could be argued that the business was obligated to offer a word of warning to their consumers.\n\nSecondly, the integrity of the takeaway container was not strong enough and could collapse easily under pressure. There was also a lack of additional insulation as added protection. In many ways, it was the company's responsibility to manufacture their packaging to complement their products and the way consumers are meant to use it.\n\nFinally, these lawsuits also acted as flags not just for the sued company, but others in the market to take into consideration. The lawsuit served as a springboard that made cupholders ubiquitous in cars. It was also an impetus that produced updated and safer designs for takeaway packaging for hot beverages.\n\nBack to the issue at hand, Guy confessed that maybe he was being a bit too biased with his point of view. He was close to Karmin and automatically placed the blame on Jo Way, the horseman of destruction, when in fact it was Karmin's lack of oversight that led to it.\n\nKarmin believed that Moris Jace, one of his earliest employees, wouldn't be swayed by greed. He didn't know that Moris was skimming off resources from the company and selling it in on the side. Guy couldn't blame him either. If someone stuck with you from the beginning, through thick and thin, you wouldn't be so cautious and disbelieving of them. He was backstabbed, and there was very little he could have done to anticipate it.\n\nSo who was truly to blame? Obviously, Moris Jace! But Guy just couldn't separate Jo Way from all of this. That man was like the agent of misfortune. Wherever he went, tragedy followed. \n\n\"Once again, I'm sorry about everything,\" Karmin said. \"All your effort was wasted.\"\n\nGuy bit his lips in worry. He truly wanted to help Karmin out, but he just couldn't come up with a worthwhile solution. He wasn't influential enough, or rich enough, to be of use.\n\nAlthough Guy had some knowledge of business management and financial matters from his old world, they were mostly perfunctory. He also couldn't apply a lot of them in this world.\n\nThus Guy resolved to rely on his strengths. He wanted to see if there was anything he could use from his old world that could be of use here.\n\nUnfortunately, the information pertaining to the high-school level and beyond was out of his reach in the RoK. Even though he could recollect some details, he couldn't access the publications until the barriers were lifted.\n\nAs Guy descended into thought, Karmin smiled bitterly and grasped a dagger on his table and played with it in his hands.\n\nKarmin was glad that there was someone to talk to. With his zealous pursuit of fame and fortune, he had sacrificed his social life. It was in trying times like these when he envied the old acquaintances from his youthful days that were now married with children. Even if they didn't have a coffer full of gold and a house with many rooms and floors, they at least had someone to offload their daily worries onto and rely on to share the burdens. Karmin was so lonely that he didn't have any friends.\n\nKarmin twirled the intricate dagger in his hands while reminiscing about his childhood. The mesmerising motion caught Guy's attention as he was struggling to brainstorm ideas.\n\nThe blade's craftsmanship looked somewhat familiar. It was a single-edged, curved blade that arced inwards, like a beast's talon. At the base of the weapon was a hoop of sorts that could accommodate one of the wielder's fingers. Karmin locked his index through the hoop and spun the bade in a clockwise and counter-clockwise motion. The design resembled a karambit from Guy's old world.\n\nHowever, what drew Guy's attention was the blade's body. The metal had patterns resembling Damascus steel. Ever since he accustomed himself to The Burning Forge, Guy had come into contact with many alloys used in weaponsmithing. To date, he was yet to find one with a texture similar to Damascus steel, except for the Dwarven sword Al owned.\n\n\"Is that a Dwarven dagger?\" Guy asked.\n\nKarmin snapped out of his thoughts and followed Guy's gaze. \"Yes. I won it through an auction. Shame that it isn't enchanted though.\"\n\nGuy tilted his head and extended his arm, \"May I?\"\n\nKarmin readily agreed and passed the dagger. As Guy held the weapon in his hands, he became mesmerised by its beauty and practicality. After immersing himself with indulgently ornamented enchanted weapons for the past few weeks, his sense of aesthetics was under constant attack. This dagger offered a much deserved moment of respite!\n\n\"I've spent a large portion of my youth trying to replicate that weapon, and failed. I just can't get the alloy's composition right,\" Karmin lamented as he eyed the dagger in Guy's hands.\n\n\"Really?\" Guy exclaimed and cast |Inspect| on the weapon. As his mana permeated the weapon, he managed to make out a few of the elements present in it.\n\n\"Don't bother. I've had many mages perform an inspection on that weapon. They all came to the same conclusion. It's not replicable in this realm. Most Dwarven weapons and armour use a special kind of metal that we haven't been able to find in Gaea; it must be a common metal in the Fel realm. It seems to be a different form of iron as far as I can tell.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's steel,\" Guy commented as he placed the weapon down carefully.\n\n\"You recognise this metal?\" Karmin quickly retorted with incredulity.\n\n\"Steel. Haven't you worked with steel before?\" Guy asked.\n\nKarmin quickly shook his head, \"What's steel?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-045]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":175,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 043 - Practice Makes Perfect","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nGuy considered himself immensely lucky to have met and become acquainted with Karmin Zola. Just as he was struggling to find a way to bolster his skills in enchanting, a ripe opportunity gently landed on his lap. Because of this, Guy made sure to make full use of this to his benefit.\n\nThe same day that Guy received access to The Burning Forge's workshop and storage, he immediately retrieved a few low-quality mana gems, and a standard set of ingredients to make basic inscribing ink, and started to inscribe a simple Reinforcement enchantment.\n\nHe chose this because according to the introductory books in the guild's library, the Reinforcement enchantment was the simplest and the starting point for newbies. Unfortunately, simple was a relative term in this case. For a seasoned chef, determining the exact measures of ingredients to prepare a fabulous meal would be a trivial task.\n\nThe main issue Guy faced in inscribing the enchantment was in completing it in its entirety at a steady, unflinching rate. First off, unlike his own modular spells, all the inscriptions published in literature adhered to the established system, containing a plethora of snaking, weaving, looping, interconnecting, and flourishing lines. This required Guy to have the entire image readily prepared in his head, and anticipate the next move while maintaining a constant pace.\n\nAlong those lines, Guy found it extremely difficult to utilise the inscribing tool for its purpose. It was a clunky device that strained his wrists. It had to be held in a fixed orientation, otherwise, the flow through its nozzle would vary causing a nonuniform inscription. The ink itself had to be siphoned into the tool from its rear-end, and it would constantly swirl and gyrate within causing the centre of mass to vary.\n\nGuy's first attempt was an utter failure. His inability to hold the tool properly resulted in a large infusion of ink immediately at the beginning. Guy had to dispose of the gem right away.\n\nThe second attempt wasn't any better. This time, the flow rate was much, much slower. So slow, that he barely registered a line after 10 minutes of concentrated work.\n\nGuy ran through many low-quality gems before determining an optimal approach angle with the inscribing tool. But that was just the start! Many more failures followed as he optimised his technique. Time-wise, it took Guy around a week-and-a-half to gain the experience to produce an average-quality Reinforcement enchantment gem.\n\nOne must note that Guy did not exclusively spend his time in The Burning Forge's workshop, improving his enchanting skills. Although it was important, he couldn't offload his own responsibilities as a teaching apprentice, and as a master to Markus.\n\nGuy later spent another week to improve his consistency, all the while familiarizing himself with the mana gems and ink used in the Empowering enchantments for the sale order.\n\nWith regards to the enchantments, the Reinforcement and Empowering enchantments were similar but were used in differing scenarios. The Reinforcement enchantment was typically applied on armour pieces, while Empowering was for weapons. While it was possible to stack them together, their redundancy made it an inefficient combination.\n\nIn addition to that, the Empowering enchantment had a slightly raised difficulty of the two due to a few additional shapes involved in the construct. Guy would have loved to deconstruct the two enchantments and categorise the individual components, however, since it wasn't of immediate importance Guy shelved it for a later date.\n\nOne should note that both the Reinforcement and Empowering enchants were passive in nature - their effect was to passively augment the weapon or armour they were slotted into. This begged the question, why bother adding these enchantments if instead, we can use stronger and more resilient metals? Although that was a logical solution, sometimes it was cheaper to use average metals, and then augment them with these enchantments. Economically, if the purchase of mana gems, ink recipes and metal, exceeded the price of only a metal that was much stronger, people tended to lean towards the former option.\n\nAfter Guy finished practising, he moved onto the real deal, albeit cautiously. He didn't want to muck things over by rushing into things too quickly. And so, Guy spent one day going over the nuances of it thoroughly.\n\nFirst, compared to his test pieces, he was no longer working with low-quality or faulty mana gems. The minerals that were to be embedded into the weapons were of very high quality and were optimal for the Empowering enchantment. That is since the enchantment was not attuned to a specific element, the minerals were similarly neutral in flavour.\n\nSecond, the ink Karmin intended to apply for this order had a different composition compared to the recipe published in the newbie guide in the guild's library. Through cross-referencing, Guy determined that this new recipe was highly specialised for the Empowering enchantment. While in the former, the constitution ensured that a wider roster of enchantments could be accommodated, the specialised ink discarded these deviances and doubled down on the Empowering properties. Due to Guy's lack of knowledge of the rarer ingredients, he couldn't discern the properties of some of the lesser-known components, but the ones he did recognise supported his hypothesis.\n\nApart from that, Guy observed that all the swords set to be enchanted were uniform. Because he knew that this world hadn't undergone an industrial revolution, he was amazed by the skill of the craftsmen employed by Karmin to be able to maintain such a level of consistency in their works. Additionally, since the Empowering enchantment was basic, the weapons didn't need to undergo any arcane processes during forging. He could basically slot an inscribed mana gem into the empty slot on the weapons and move on.\n\nAfter a thorough once-over, Guy began his enchanting marathon in earnest. Karmin had informed him earlier that the order was due within a month. Guy had sufficient confidence in his skill by this point, and he was sure that he could meet that deadline. So, Guy started by scheduling his work. He was a firm believer in spreading the work over the duration of the task. Unlike many of his students, who preferred to complete all their work the day before the deadline, Guy fervently preached the dangers of rushed, last-minute work.\n\nHe found that if he finished three to four enchantments every day, he could complete the entire order, with a few days to spare. The pace was manageable, so Guy went with that plan.\n\nHis first day of enchanting was a little stressful. Even after all that practice, he just couldn't overcome the jitters on his first official enchantment. \n\nAfter meditating and centring himself, Guy brought down the tool. His hands moved at a steady pace, maintaining his posture and techniques cultivated through weeks of practice.\n\nFollowing a strained hour, Guy finally lowered the tool and heaved a sigh of relief. He spent another minute going over the inscribed gem, taking note of any possible issues. Although the enchantment was successful, minor inconsistencies or errors could manifest much later through repeated activations. \n\nAfter Guy was satisfied with his work, he carefully placed the mana gem and pumped his fist in celebration. It was a glorious moment for him, and he was immensely elated at achieving the first step in his multi-step plan.\n\nWithout wasting any more time, Guy moved on to the next gem.\n\nGuy completed his work steadily. He didn't have to slot the gems into the weapons personally. All he had to do was transfer the inscribed gems down the pipeline, to one of the many smiths on standby in the workshop.\n\nEven though inscribing the same enchantment again and again was a banal process, Guy found a weird serenity in it that was lacking in his usual meditation. There was a calmness in all that monotony. In all the hubbub after transmigrating into this world, this was the first time Guy truly managed to centre his thoughts.\n\nOne day, while Guy was immersing himself in the lingering peace from his day's work, he ran across Karmin's office and noticed the man staring into space with a visible frown.\n\nGuy didn't want to interfere with Karmin's thoughts, but just as he was about to leave he heard a defeated sigh from Karmin.\n\n\"After all my years of being cautious, my one lapse in judgement cost me everything...\"\n\nGuy wasn't one to interfere in other's life willy-nilly, but Karmin was his meal ticket and saviour, for the time being. So he felt morally obligated to lend an ear and shoulder to the depressed man.\n\nGuy knocked at Karmin's ajar office door and signalled his presence. The sound pulled Karmin's attention.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Guy!\" Karmin said with a visibly strained smile. Clearly, the man was trying to put on a brave front.\n\nGuy decided to circle the area before hitting the target, so he commented, \"It's great to see you! I am nearly three-quarters of the way there with the enchantments. I've inspected all of the completed pieces, and they seem to be in perfect form. Even Callum is satisfied with the work.\"\n\nKarmin's smile immediately deflated as he turned moody again. \"I forgot to tell you. The client backed out from the order.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Guy asked in shock.\n\n\"They just cancelled their order the day before yesterday. I was a bit preoccupied with other matters and forgot to let you know. I'm sorry that you wasted your time for nothing,\" Karmin added apologetically.\n\nGuy quickly shook his hands and refuted, \"Please, don't apologise! I am grateful for the opportunity in and of itself. But I don't get it. Isn't there a heavy fee for breaching the contract so unceremoniously?\"\n\nKarmin snorted, \"That's the thing. They broke the contract and coughed up the entire amount for breaching it too!\"\n\nThe then sighed, \"It's just one out of the many unfortunate series of events that have befallen by company in the past few weeks...\"\n\nGuy shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He could see that Karmin had completely lost himself. Although they weren't officially friends, Guy was indebted and grateful to Karmin in many ways.\n\n\"Is there... anything I can do to help?\" Guy asked with a mix of unsurity and concern. Even if he wasn't a strong and influential individual such as Al, Guy was willing to do his best and help Karmin out.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-044]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":176,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 042 - Guide to Avoid Getting Face-Slapped","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nWei Zao had initially set out this day to find a suitable weapon for his student. Gaige was trained in swordsmanship, and his cultivation method was also complemented by sword arts. While he himself didn't have any money to fund the purchase, Gaige had regained his family's interest and secured his father's backing once again. The process was fairly generic, a couple of duelling challenges here, a few insults and sleights there... Anyways, the end result was that they had more money to work with now, and a solid backer.\n\nGaige's father didn't actually write Gaige off following the repeated failures in cultivation. The man still held a deep affection for his blue-eyed sweetheart and the product of their love and had spent great efforts in the shadows to help Gaige. He couldn't appear to show favouritism to his \"illegitimate son\" in front of his legal wife and her family, lest it descends into a full-blown conflict between clans. Therefore, the man was infinitely grateful to Wei Zao for helping his ward out and offered this world's equivalent of a \"black card\" for his personal coffers, which could be used to fund Gaige in any way possible.\n\nAlthough Wei Zao was eager to create a weapon on his own that was perfectly suited for Gaige, he realised the process wasn't so simple since the Omniscient Library didn't provide hints in smithing and enchanting like with alchemy. Forging, smithing and enchanting were inherently fluid in nature, and it was impossible to write precise instructions that applied universally.\n\nTherefore, the only logical option was to search out suitable weapons from the market. The world was vast, there must be something out there that could meet his student's needs!\n\nWith that in mind, Wei Zao directly approached the most well-known weapon and armour store in Radiant City, The Burning Forge. The moment he entered its premises, he was reminded of the luxury boutiques from his old world. Various weapons and armours were set out in display, with their information pasted conveniently next to them. The sales representatives stationed nearby would assist in terms of usage and fitting. The store even offered personalised forging services; it was definitely a high-class establishment.\n\nWei Zao grew extremely excited and started to inspect all the items in the store to see how they matched up with Gaige's cultivation and specialisations.\n\nHe found a perfect sword, advertised to be forged with an alloy that the Omniscient Library stated could resonate with dark-type mana and cultivation. It was totally suitable for Gaige!\n\nWei Zao approached the display sword and stroked the weapon carefully, causing a book to materialise in his Omniscient Library. As Wei Zao read through it, his brows furrowed. He quickly waved at a representative, and asked with curiosity, \"Are the display pieces supposed to be cheaper replicas of the real deal?\"\n\nThe representative tilted his head in confusion and shook his head, \"No, Sir. These pieces are exact replicas of the actual weapon. We have unexposed versions of the same weapon in storage which we resize and sharpen to fit the user's needs. These display pieces offer the customer a way to judge their compatibility with the weapons.\"\n\nWei Zao didn't lower his voice and spoke, \"But this weapon isn't made of hundred-per cent Gandorium blend as advertised, though.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" The representative retorted incredulously.\n\n\"The information sheet here states that the sword is forged with the purest Gandorium blend. However, the piece seems to be only 80% Gandorium, the rest is comprised of Orichalcum. I guess it is easy to confuse since their aesthetic properties are similar and Orichalcum is functionally inert. But the result is a 5% reduction in the sword's resonance with a plethora of mana types. I know that it sounds minor, but for a mage at a lower realm, each per cent means a lot,\" Wei Zao rattled calmly.\n\nThe representative glanced around in panic as he saw a crowd forming. This was bad news!\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"That man claims that the sword is falsely advertised.\"\n\n\"The Burning Forge wouldn't pull something like that, right? They're a reputed establishment.\"\n\n\"Who can say for sure? Let's watch what happens.\"\n\nThe representative grit his teeth and retorted with as much respect as he could muster, \"Sir, please don't make such wild claims without evidence. The Burning Forge prides itself for its quality and after-sale services.\"\n\nWei Zao frowned when he heard that. Here he was, offering a well-meaning explanation out of goodwill, only to receive the scorn of the opposite party. \"I'm not making things up. Why don't you inspect the sword?\"\n\nEveryone gasped at that claim. To inspect an artefact meant to call in a Smithing and Enchanting Guild's official to run an inspection. This was so that the results were unbiased and accurate. While it may seem like a trivial process, the result could make or break an individual or company. If the guild announced that the sword was as Wei Zao claimed, then The Burning Forge would suffer a huge blow and lose its credibility.\n\nThe inspection process was heavily skewed against the smith or enchanter, and the person calling for the inspection faced no consequences. The reason for this was backed by many historical cons and schemes, resulting in the guild cracking down on fakers and their members.\n\nWei Zao's blatant call for an inspection angered the representative and he retorted in a raised voice, \"Can this Sir please explain his reasoning? Are you a licensed member of the Smithing and Enchanting Guild?\"\n\nWei Zao replied with a wry smile, \"Not really...\"\n\n\"They how can you go about making such claims and expect us to believe it. Is calling for an inspection from the guild such as easy ask that just about anyone can do it? Furthermore, aren't you looking down on The Burning Forge?\"\n\nWei Zao retaliated dramatically, \"I've only been pointing it out to you out of goodwill. But it looks like you aren't willing to accept it. Let do this: I am willing to stake double, NO! Quadruple! of what this sword is being sold for. If what I've claimed is false then I will pay this establishment immediately and never show my face here ever again. However, if what I said is true...\"\n\nThe representative caught on to the extended pause and prepared to agree to the challenge, \"If it is true then The Burning Forge will personally apologise to you and make amends to all the individuals that have purchased this sword, monetarily!\"\n\n____\n\nThis was what Karmin saw when he arrived at the shop floor.\n\n\"Who the hell does this man think he is?\" Karmin muttered in anger. He wasn't giving Karmin any face by blatantly making wild claims about his business' integrity.\n\nKarmin was about to go and affirm the representative's challenge and add additional stakes to thoroughly suppress this Jo Way. But the moment he took a step, he recollected Guy's advice.\n\n\"Jo Way isn't a simple person...\"\n\nKarmin pondered on it for a bit. What did Guy mean when he said that? Karim glanced at Jo Way's resolute and confident expression, and he wavered.\n\n'What if he was right?' Karmin exclaimed. 'No! I can't take any risks!'\n\nKarmin coughed audibly and drew everyone's attention, \"You! Who are you to make such promises on behalf of The Burning Forge?\"\n\n\"That's Mister Zola, the 2-star Smith!\"\n\n\"Him? Wow, he looks so imposing!\"\n\nKarmin shook his head to tune out from the conversations running in the background. He drilled his eyes into the representative and glared meaningfully. The representative was a little shaken at first, but his training kicked in. He had worked in The Burning Forge for over 5 years now, and he had personally interacted with Karmin on many occasions. So, he was quick to pick up the hints Karmin was dropping. He bowed down apologetically and said, \"I apologise for my presumptuousness, Mister Zola. I got too agitated, and my tongue slipped.\"\n\nKarmin frowned, as an act, and continued, \"Why are you apologising to me? What is The Burning Forge's unspoken rule?\"\n\nWithout waiting for anyone to make stupid guesses, he answered his own question, \"The customer is always right!\"\n\nThe representative was quick to swallow his irritation and offered a convincing apology to Jo Way.\n\n\"For your mistake, I will be suspending you without pay, effective immediately!\" Karmin declared and once again glared meaningfully at the representative. Thankfully, the man had the presence of mind and caught on to the additional hints.\n\n'Mister Zola is trying to redirect the crowd's attention!'\n\nHe then quickly walked out with faked dejection and drooping shoulders.\n\n\"Mister Zola is so unwavering. The Burning Forge truly does care for their customers!\"\n\n\"You're so right! Wait, what are we standing around here for again?\"\n\n\"I don't know... Oh right! I came to buy a new shield for my wife. Man, she is so strong!\"\n\nKarmin sighed in relief internally and approached Jo Way, who appeared to be discombobulated by the awkward turn of events. This wasn't how things usually turned out...\n\n\"I apologise for my employee's rudeness. It was my fault for not training them properly,\" he apologised.\n\nKarmin didn't wait for Jo Way to respond, though. Because he right away snapped his fingers and seamlessly guided Jo Way away from the sword, \"Right! Why don't we do it this way...\"\n\nHe pulled out a token from his coat pocket and offered it to Jo Way with both hands. \"This is The Burning Forge's personal forging token. It is only available to the VIPs and the elites that are affiliated with our establishment. This token works like a gift, by which the holder can request The Burning Forge to make for them a single, personalised item to meet their needs. I saw that you are looking for a sword made of Gandorium blend. using this token, you can ask for one made of a Gandorium-Brionium composite, free of charge!\"\n\nJo Way's eyes visibly widened at that statement. Brionium was an extremely rare metal that was a hundred times more resonant to the dark-type element. Jo Way initially wanted to find a weapon made completely out of Brionium for Gaige, but he recognised that it was financially impossible even with the \"black card\".\n\nJo Way gulped audibly and accepted the token. \"It's no big deal! Thank you for this token. I will gladly take you up on that offer.\"\n\nWith it finally, in his hands, Jo Way quickly darted out of the store with an excited expression. Since he now had a freebie token, he could design a weapon bespoke to Gaige's cultivation and martial art.\n\nOnce Jo Way turned a corner, Karmin waved his hands and another representative walked up to him with the displayed sword.\n\nKarmin moved his hands over the blade and used a magnification artefact to observe it carefully. As his hands slid further, the frown on his face turned grew deeper.\n\nHe faced the representative next to him and instructed, \"Tell Callum to seize Craftsman Jace and all his assets. Also, make sure that everything is discreet.\"\n\nAs the representative rushed away, Karmin contemplated on what transpired.\n\n'Moris Jace! You shouldn't have taken my kindness for granted. Stealing from me will be the last thing you do - I will make sure of it!'\n\nHe then sighed, 'Thank the Sun that I didn't rush in and make a fool of myself. If it wasn't for Guy Larks' warning I would have truly ruined myself...'\n\nThe outcome would have gone one of two ways; Karmin was thankful that it went positively.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-043]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":177,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 041 - The Burning Forge","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nThe tour through the guild building was short. Guy had already familiarised himself with the place, apart from a few sections which were marked as off-limits to him due to his lack of clearance. However, with a wave of Karmin's badge, most of those blocks were lifted and Guy was welcomed into the more privileged areas.\n\nIt was more of an informative tour for Guy as he got to observe how the guilds generally operated in this world. Each was directly connected to a head office which was usually occluded from the low-level members. It was possible to transition directly from the head office to the subsidiary buildings through a Teleportation Ritual Formation at the core of the guild building and only those with the authorised seals could activate it. Apart from that, there were also communication artefacts that provided a direct line to any other subsidiary guild in the world.\n\nThe guilds themselves were non-profit organisations, so any surplus earned was directly invested into enhancing the guild's foundations.\n\nKarmin was also a little unenthusiastic about the guild tour. He was more eager to take Guy to his shop, The Burning Forge! And so, the duo finished the tour within the hour.\n\n\"The Burning Forge has been operating since the year 5122,\" Karmin declared proudly as he walked with a skip in his steps.\n\nThe timekeeping standard underwent a reset following the Age of Isolation. Thus, the year when Gaea was completely and truly isolated from the other realms was the generally accepted year zero in the standard calendar. Additionally, similar to back in Earth, each year was divided into 12 months with each month containing 30 days.\n\nGuy nodded along as he followed Karmin while observing his surroundings. They were currently walking through the commercial district in Radiant City which was home to a large number of shops and outlets selling a plethora of goods and services. He had never explored this region since his transmigration, mainly because he was lacking financially.\n\nKarmin's Burning Forge was close to the centre of the district, indicating its prominence in the local market. Furthermore, like most of the shops in this region of the market, it was separated from its neighbours, unlike the other stores that were attached with a shared wall.\n\nThe shop itself was separated into multiple spaces. The part of the store facing the shopping district acted as the outlet front. Customers could access this section freely, peruse the goods on sale, and make one-off purchases. This outlet was operated by impeccably dressed and young individuals. The men were toned and had a warrior's aura surrounding them, and the women appeared delicate and alluring. Through observation, Guy understood Karmin's strategy. The women would draw in a crowd of testosterone-driven sheep, while the men would offload the goods through showy demonstrations and jargon-filled sales pitches. \n\nAdjacent to the outlet, yet occluded behind a wall, was the import and export dock. Half-finished or completed goods would transit through this point. The latter would go directly to the local storage block which was attached to this section or would move to the showcasing area in the outlet front. The former would be directed to a local workspace to add the finishing touches before being placed on display or sold.\n\nAs a matter of safety, The Burning Forge's main office was located on a confidential site. Most large companies and businesses followed this practice to protect their assets. Due to the lack of stringent patenting, copyrighting and licensing systems in this world, theft and counterfeiting were commonplace. Thus, these confidential sites acted as fortresses that guarded a companies secrets and unique selling points.\n\nKarmin led Guy through the back of the shop to avoid any stray eyes trained his way. They walked through the import and export dock to the workshop that adjoined the outlet and the dock.\n\n\"So here's where you'll be working,\" Karmin said as he opened the doors into the workshop.\n\nGuy released a drawn-out whistle of awe as he beheld the sight. Unlike his initial assumptions, the workshop was a lot cleaner and well maintained. While there were soot markings, metal deposits, wood shavings, and other residues, there were workers that would frequently clean up the area and clear up any obstructions.\n\nMultiple forges were working adjacently, each being operated by a fixed group of people. For instance, one forge was run by a group of three individuals drawing out a standard-sized sword and sharpening its edge. One worker was responsible for heating the sword and repositioning it, while another was responsible for hammering it. The third was first in charge of managing the forge and then shifting over to running the grindstone. Essentially, one person did not have to take on all the work by themselves.\n\n\"Mister Zola! What brings you here today?\" A giant of a man exclaimed with a gravelly voice. He appeared to be the overseer, the manager responsible for the workshop. He wore a sleeveless tank-top with an apron draped over it. His face was slathered with soot and sweat, enhancing his already domineering appearance. He would make a perfect bouncer if not for his uncharacteristically jovial smile.\n\n\"Callum! How was the shipment of to-be-enchanted weapons that arrived yesterday?\" Karmin asked while shaking the man's, Callum Bose's, extended hand.\n\n\"Looks basic enough,\" Callum shrugged. \"I don't see anything different about it, apart from the empty sockets for the gems, of course.\"\n\nKarmin nodded, \"The first order is for a set of basic Empowering enchantments. You don't need to forge the weapons differently for it.\"\n\nCallum hummed in acknowledgement, \"Well, I've followed protocol and moved it to storage with today's shipment of mana gems and enchanting ink ingredients.\"\n\nKarmin seamlessly led the conversation through the forge towards a quieter office space next to the outlet. While they were transitioning, Callum's eyes landed on Guy who was silently following them.\n\n\"Who might you be?\" Callum asked respectfully. Since he knew that the person was brought in by Mister Zola, the man was definitely unordinary.\n\nKarmin realised that he had disregarded Guy this whole time and quickly sorted out the introductions, \"This is Teaching Apprentice Guy Larks. He is currently being sponsored by Teacher Jeeves in the Smithing and Enchanting Guild. I've invited him in because he has offered to run the enchanting for our upcoming order for the Kraven Mercenary Corp.\"\n\nCallum's eyes widened in astonishment. He was familiar with Teacher Al Jeeves, who was a veritable powerhouse in Radiant City. To be affiliated with such an individual, Callum automatically raised his evaluation of Guy by a few levels.\n\nHe then picked up from where Karmin left off, \"That's good to know. The order has been burning a hole in our pockets for quite some time now. It's great that we can finally get to it! Why don't I show Mister Larks his workspace?\"\n\nKarmin nodded appreciatively while adding, \"Also give him a token to access the storage. Mister Larks may need to use a few resources as practice,\" he then turned to Guy while adding, \"Just inform Callum here if you're logging out anything. As long as it isn't out of our reach, it shouldn't be a problem.\"\n\nGuy smiled in response and bowed as a sign of gratitude, \"Thank you so much for your assistance!\"\n\nKarmin waved his hands. Just as he was about to respond, a sudden commotion resounded through the walls. With a frown, Karmin asked, \"What's happening out there?\"\n\nCallum furrowed his brows and walked out briskly. After a quick half a minute, he returned with an awkward expression plastered across his face.\n\n\"There seems to be a kerfuffle between a customer and one of our sales representatives,\" Callum clarified.\n\n\"What? Why?\" Karmin asked.\n\n\"The customer claims that one of our swords up for sale is of sub-par quality compared to what was advertised,\" Callum spoke in displeasure.\n\nKarmin snorted and retorted, \"Who is he? Someone from the guild?\"\n\nCallum shook his head, \"He doesn't appear to be certified. Just some average teaching apprentice from Radiant Academy.\"\n\nBut then Callum quickly bit his tongue and turned to Guy with an apologetic look. Guy chuckled in response to show that no offence was taken.\n\n\"Who does he think he is, sauntering into my company and claiming that I'm cheating my customers!\" Karmin exclaimed with righteous indignation.\n\nCallum offered some additional information, \"According to the chatter, he is called Jo way. Rumour on the streets is that he is currently undertaking Gaige Bori for the upcoming trial.\"\n\nKarmin stood up in a huff and prepared to set things straight. But right as his hands grasped the door handle, a loud cough interrupted him, \"Umm... Mister Zola! Please hold on for a second.\"\n\nThe moment Guy heard Jo Way's name, a sense of discomfort washed over him. The hair on the back of Guy's neck stood straight as his face-slapping sense blared in earnest. Although Guy welcomed Jo Way's antics once in a while, currently it was a little inconvenient for him.\n\nGuy was depending on Karmin to support his enchanting ventures, and he couldn't afford to lose this backing. So Guy offered a few words of warning, \"That Jo Way isn't a simple person. It would be better if you approached this matter with greater caution. My sincere advice is that you observe the situation carefully before intervening recklessly.\"\n\nThose measured words quickly doused Karmin's swelling rage. With a calmer state of mind, Karmin left the room while throwing out a few instructions at Callum.\n\nCallum then led Guy towards his new workspace.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-042]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":178,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 040 - Profitable Opportunity","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"You see, I really need to get myself acquainted with gem inscribing for a project I'm working on for my student. I was considering going through the Guild's training program for the practitioner's license, however, the matter is quite urgent and I don't need to go through such a large assortment of topics for it. I'm completely new to this field, and I don't want to annoy Teacher Jeeves with such trivialities, so I was wondering if you had any suggestions?\" Guy spoke with apprehension.\n\nGuy sneakily name-dropped Al Jeeves to peak Karmin's interest, and he succeeded! Because once Karmin heard the request he entered a state of ponderance.\n\n\"What's the project about?\" Karmin asked while he considered the nuances of Guy's inquiry. Being someone learned in the way of the world, Karmin had long since become accustomed to such actions. One must never jump into something without prior knowledge because doing so was asking for ruin.\n\nThus, Guy stated his piece, \"Well, here's the deal -\". In doing so Guy made sure to tread around certain topics such as the modular spellmaking venture. While it was somewhat pertinent to the matter at hand, he didn't want to reveal too much and attract unwanted attention. Not more than he already had, at least... \n\nDuring his explanation, Guy slowly released the suppression he held on his ferverous side, and let it ooze into the conversation. He had to sound sincere and unwavering, and his uber rational side wasn't able to fully convey that emotion.\n\nAs Karmin absorbed the information, he started to gain a better understanding of Guy. Just like Karmin had predicted, Guy was in no way a simple man. There had to have been a reason for Teacher Jeeves' willingness to accommodate someone to such as extent. And from what Karmin heard, he quickly grasped what made Guy stand out.\n\nIt was his truly unorthodox and opposing thoughts on matters that were considered established that highlighted Guy's character. First, Guy was willing to stake his future on a kid that most teachers would avoid or dismiss. Karmin was envious of the student called Markus for finding himself a teacher such as Guy. Deep down, Karmin likened himself to Markus; both of them were from a lowly background and while Karmin found his success, it followed heavy sacrifices and many disappointments. Markus could have ended up in a worse starting position than Karmin. After all, the kid was an orphan and a failed mage to boot. Such an impact on the kid's psyche would take years to heal.\n\nThe second aspect of Guy's that Karmin found commendable was the man's ability to think outside the box. In fact, that could still be considered an understatement. The box never entered Guy's eyee! Fortunately, the man wasn't flighty; Guy produced his own plan of action which was detailed and goal-oriented. With his own experiences, Karmin could easily determine that even if a layman were to follow those steps, they would achieve the required outcome, albeit with varying durations.\n\nFinally, Karmin was strangely attracted to Guy's unflinching zeal and passion. It came completely out of the blue! When they started talking, Guy looked like a statue and spoke in a measured manner. However, when he started to talk about his whole \"pilgrimage\" to \"create a means to communicate the Truth of the World\" Karmin was a little shaken. If not for the methodical approach, and infallible research supporting the whole spiel, Karmin worried that he had unwittingly stepped into an initiation ceremony of a Demonic Cult. What he found surprising, and embarrassing at the same time, was that subconsciously he was willing to submit to the cause!\n\nJust when a lull presented itself in Guy's impassioned explanation, Karmin intervened, \"*cough* I think I might have a solution for your problem.\"\n\nThat was sufficient to attract Guy's attention, who started to reapply pressure on his ferverous self. He was starting to get queasy with every word spoken. Unfortunately, his mind lacked sufficient strength to maintain the suppression and so Guy quickly reverted to the Church and removed his mask. Once his state of mind stabilised and restored to his usual identity, Guy returned to his body and picked up the conversation where it was left off.\n\n\"A solution?\" He asked.\n\nKarmin nodded as he replied, \"The matter is quite simple. In fact, I think it will benefit both of us.\" Then with a satisfied smile, he continued, \"What you need is practice with inscribing gems. It just so happens that I am currently sitting on an important work order of enchanted weapons, and am lacking an enchanter.\"\n\nGuy hummed in comprehension and leaned forward in earnest.\n\n\"I'm actually here today in search of prospective enchanters to hire for my business. Unfortunately, my attempts have been... less than fortuitous. Furthermore, the situation has dragged on for too long, and the due date is fast approaching.\"\n\nAnd with that, Karmin entered his negotiation stance. He wasn't one to sacrifice profit for the sake of friendship. It may seem callous and cold-hearted, but the world was such and he couldn't do anything about it.\n\n\"So here's what I can offer: I already have a surplus of items in my store to get my hired enchanter up and running and warmed up. I can allow you to use those as initial practice. Once you are used to it, and if I am satisfied, you can move on to the work order and polish your skills on those items. Don't worry, the request isn't beyond your reach. Since this was my first time selling enchanted goods, the order I took in asked for only the most basic of enchantments. I was planning to use this as a test in hiring enchanters - the work should be manageable by those with a practitioner's license.\"\n\nKarmin spoke with a deliberate tone. He was clear on his stance - the offer was beneficial to Guy as it catered to his need for practice. However, money mattered as well!\n\n\"Since you don't technically have a license from the guild, I will have to tell my client that the work is from an unlicensed enchanter. That automatically lowers the sale price since there are no guarantees in the quality of my product. So I hope you understand that I cannot remunerate you at a standard rate.\"\n\nGuy quickly grasped where Karmin was going with the conversation. He had learned enough in his old life to understand the weight behind certifications and brand names. So, Guy quickly waved his hands and offered a retort, \"Money isn't an issue. For the time being anyway. Also, I would be exploiting your kind intentions if I accepted payment for the work - it is benefitting me the most after all.\"\n\nHe then added jokingly, \"I would appreciate it if you could cover payment for my food, though.\"\n\nKarmin laughed mirthfully. While he respected Guy and Teacher Jeeves, and very much wanted to build robust connections, he was unwilling to cede ground excessively. Something he had learned over the years was the ungratefulness of people. No matter how much you treat someone favourably, there is no guarantee that they will pay you to pack equally at a later date. While cynical, his worldview was cemented on this principle. Favours and benefits must be tangible and guaranteeable. There is no such thing as banking on goodwill, that's a fool's venture.\n\nA beneficial connection wasn't grounded on favours that offered no immediate profits to yourself. That is a waste of time and money. Unless you yourself can gain something from providing a favour, it is best to avoid the prospect in its entirety. Only idiots tie their entire being onto the thighs of a powerful individual, sacrificing everything in the process. Dynasties rise and fall, people die and others rise to take their place.\n\nGuy wasn't perturbed by Karmin's negotiation tactics. He was inducted into the world of business and finance in his previous life after observing his elder brother. Therefore, Guy was pleased by Karmin's tact and presence of mind in handling the situation. He wasn't planning to exploit Karmin, and Karmin didn't seem like he was ok with someone walking all over him. Overall, it was a profitable deal for both parties.\n\nKarmin brought his hand forward while saying, \"Since you've waived your wages, I don't think any complicated paperwork needs to be drawn up. Let's shake on it!\"\n\nGuy eyebrows twitched at Karmin's straightforwardness.\n\n'I guess this is the man I'm getting in bed with,' he thought to himself. Guy then smiled and sealed the deal with a handshake.\n\n\"Since that's out of the way, why don't I show you around the guild and if you're available I can even take you over to my shop?\" Karmin asked excitedly.\n\nGuy nodded in agreement, \"That would be great. I'm sure it will be more convincing to your employees if I arrived at your shop with the owner rather than your token.\"\n\nThe two laughed together and left the cafeteria while chatting casually. The others present in the cafeteria were a little confused by the turn of events. Karmin was a famous member of the Radiant City Smithing and Enchanting Guild - he had a 2-star license after all.\n\nThey never thought that the guy they dismissed as average and waste would attract the attention of another bigshot. Each of them felt a sting on their cheeks as if a metaphorical palm had struck it unceremoniously. All they could do was swallow their embarrassment and move on.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-041]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":179,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 039 - Tasting the Limelight","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nOne thing that used to irritate Guy a lot after transmigrating into this world was how everyone just kept ignoring him as if he was a nonexistent entity. Even if he was the only other person in the room, they'd treat him like air. The last time he was at the library, some kid sat right in front of him and just let out an ear-shattering fart, then he looked around to make sure no one heard it AND sighed in relief!\n\nHe didn't know why it was like that. Maybe it was the aura surrounding him that encouraged people to overlook his existence. Even in his past life, he'd met people who had a forgettable presence. They would pass through other people's lives without leaving a mark. They didn't have anything that separated them from the crowd - nothing that made them stand out.\n\nBut just like everything, Guy only realised the benefits of his nonexistence after he entered the limelight. After all, being sponsored by a famous individual such as Al Jeeves was a recipe for gaining a lot of attention in a short time frame.\n\nIt was only after Guy got the taste of fame that he started to regret his initial dissatisfaction with his facelessness.\n\nIn many ways, the feeling was similar to how it was like in his old world but amplified by a lot. As a son from a prolific family, he had his fair share of prominence and public recognition. He never shied away from it because he realised that it was a byproduct of his birth. One could say that he was at the peak of existence in his previous life. However, that wasn't the case here.\n\nIn this world, he was only a grunt - an insignificant being without anything to his name. People never care about grunts and mob characters because they never interfere with anything. But when a mob character enters the spotlight suddenly, without any backing to it, then things get murky.\n\nPeople are fine when a scion from a rich household gains many favours because it is expected. People are also fine when a pauper gains fame and recognition due to their talents, that is also expected. But what if an average individual suddenly rises to fame? That is just indigestible!\n\n'What makes him so special? I'm just like him, why can't I get equally lucky?' They'd argue, and those would be valid points. Why was he so lucky?\n\nTo that, Guy couldn't say anything. Luck operated in mysterious ways. He'd been a victim to it in his past life, and he was not going to mess around with it in this life.\n\nAll Guy could do was suck it up and bear with it, which was what he had been doing ever since he entered the cafeteria to have a filling meal.\n\nAs soon as he entered, he'd attracted the attention of everyone in the room. They all stared at him like he was a deer entering a wolves' den. Gulping down his discomfort, Guy found a fairly isolated corner in the room and sat down to eat. Unfortunately, that was never going to happen anytime soon, since the moment his rear touched the chair, the seat opposite him was occupied by a pair of enthusiastic individuals.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Forna -\" \"And I'm Morian -\" They said excitedly while extending their hands as a sign of greeting.\n\nGuy was a little surprised, and also felt a little awkward. Cautiously, he offered his hand and reciprocated the greeting, \"Hi, I'm Guy Larks.\"\n\nRight after they completed the greeting, the two opposite him started talking, \"We know! We were interested in discussing with you about something, - \"\n\nAnd that was when things took a 180-degree turn. They started asking him questions regarding enchanting and smithing starting from the practising level. To Guy, it all felt like some form of a viva voce examination. He tried his best to contest the barrage of inquiries, but he was quickly starting to get overwhelmed. They didn't even offer him enough time to enter his RoK and cheat!\n\nAfter Guy slipped up in fielding a few questions, the two started to openly display their displeasure and immediately left in a huff, not forgetting to throw out a few subtle jabs his way for \"wasting their time\". Guy very much wanted to stand up and retort that it was them that initiated this conversation, but he held his tongue - he was too hungry to retaliate.\n\nMaybe it was his willingness to submit to those jeers, or it was his unassuming appearance and aura, but the way everyone looked at him skewed a little. While the general feeling remained consistent, it had a more offensive aftertaste. It was as if he was still a deer in a wolves' den, just that he was now visibly sickly and diseased.\n\n\"What did Teacher Jeeves see in him anyway? He's just a nobody.\"\n\n\"Who are we to argue with how those bigshots think? Anyways, I bet I'm better than him!\"\n\nHe could hear such grumblings in the background. Basically, due to the lack of Internet, the public did not have a forum to offload their displeasure through anonymity. And so they resolved to air out their insults through hushed conversations in the general vicinity of the target in question.\n\nGuy had only read of or seen this in web novels from his old world. He never thought that he'd one day be subjected to it.\n\nAt least with cyberbullying, one could always disconnect themselves, even if it wasn't a substantial solution. But with these offhanded comments floating around him, Guy just didn't know how to shut things out. Some of the insults were quite personal and painful to hear - these guys did not hold anything back!\n\nGuy could barely swallow the food on his plate with the words buzzing around him. It was starting to make him feel angry. He hadn't felt such emotions in a really long time.\n\nTo calm himself, Guy quickly retreated into the RoK and found some reprieve. Unfortunately, as long as he remained in here his body would stay dormant. This meant that he couldn't eat!\n\nJust as Guy was about to leave the RoK, his gaze landed on the unfamiliar void mask. Ever since that thing manifested in the RoK, Guy had been avoiding it like the plague. The first time he wore it, he was subjected to a very detached feeling. While there was a passion when he spoke, there was also a general sense of dissociation. It was as if he both simultaneously meant, and was indifferent to things he uttered. He was simply a clear mirror that reflected what the person before him wanted to hear. Guy surmised that it was the awkward combination of unfettered passion from the mask and his sliver of supreme rationality that caused this conflicting situation.\n\nWith hesitation, Guy picked up the mask and put it on. He was immediately subjected to a feeling of being lowered into a cold bath as a shadow crept all over him. Following that, he entered the all too foreign trance-like state. Zealousness and passion manifested in his psyche, but Guy forced his rational mind to suppress them. He was NOT going to preach drivel in public and ruin the last bit of reputation he had earned.\n\nGuy didn't want to remain in the Church any longer than necessary and wooshed out of it without pause. After returning to his body, Guy once again looked at the people around him. As he saw into their eyes, he got a glimpse into their inner thoughts and feelings. It wasn't as if he was reading their minds, but rather he was more receptive to the general direction their emotions were leaning.\n\nIf he was preaching, this would have made things so much easier! He could so easily rope in- *cough* enlighten these poor sheep and show them the True World!\n\nGuy shook those thoughts and started to eat the sumptuous, and now cold, meal in front of him. Guy pushed his rational mind to maintain dominance. Using this method, he had entered a complete state of separation and was unaffected by the things happening around him.\n\nThen while he chewed, he would direct his attention to the people in his vicinity. As he examined them, those at the receiving end were extremely creeped out. They felt as if his gaze was drilling into them and stripping them bare.\n\nOrganically, a perimeter started to form around him that people started to avoid. This didn't stop them from grumbling disfavourably though. They just increased their volume so that he could still hear them.\n\nRight as Guy was halfway through with his food, another individual approached him. Unlike the two that came before, this one was more courteous and actually asked whether the seat was occupied. Guy was unconcerned and gestured for the man to take a seat.\n\nOnce the individual introduced himself and began talking, Guy started to evaluate the person. Just based on the way the conversation was going, Guy could sense that the man was here with the intent to make his acquaintance. Even though the man, Karmin, knew about Guy's mediocrity he was willing to entertain this thought, which was interesting.\n\n\"If you ever need to find me, just show this at the reception of The Burning Forge,\" the man said while placing an identification token before Guy. When Karmin spoke the name of his business, there was a sense of pride bursting within his voice. Guy glanced at the engraving in the token and quickly realised that Karmin was the owner of The Burning Forge.\n\n'He looks at his company as his own child,' Guy concurred. Through a series of deductions, Guy concluded that Karmin probably raised the business from scraps solely through his efforts.\n\nGuy took a minute to consider Karmin and his intention. As he looked into his eyes, he could see that the man had ambition and drive. Guy could also glean from the way Karmin carried himself, and his open-mindedness, that he was a man with vast experience. Just the fact that Karmin was willing to gamble in connecting with Guy simply based on Guy's thin connection with Al was reason enough to support this. Compared to those born of money in this world, the flexibility and capacity to lower one's pride signified that Karmin was most likely of a lower origin. \n\nAs Guy looked further, he could see a genuineness in Karmin that was lacking in others he'd met before. The man before him did not seem to grumble over his shortcomings and was always looking for a way to make up for it. The man was a lot like Al in that sense.\n\nGuy smiled as he carefully lifted the token on the table, \"It's truly my luck to meet an accomplished individual such as yourself, Smith Zola.\"\n\nAs he spoke those words, Guy too lowered his guard and prepared to enter a genuine conversation. And it worked as Karmin, most likely sensing Guy's amiability, started to contribute wholeheartedly.\n\nGuy fully used Karmin as a resource to whet his newly learned knowledge. Although the man was only a smith, he seemed to have a great deal of insight in enchanting.\n\nWhile Guy interacted with Karmin, a thought started to surface in his mind. He seemed to have a lot of items on his to-do list that needed attention simultaneously. While it was alright depending on Al, it wouldn't do if Guy had to go to Al for everything. He needed to diversify his portfolio in some way. Karmin seemed like an honest and good-natured individual. \n\nAnd best of all, Karmin was a businessman at heart, which meant that as long as Guy could offer benefits equal to the favours he asked for, Karmin would be willing to assist.\n\nThus, Guy gently probed, \"I know that this is presumptuous, seeing as how we just met. But I have a request-\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-040]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":180,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 038 - Karmin Zola","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Is he the person that Teacher Jeeves endorsed? He doesn't look that special to me... Wait! He's only in the Late Mana Condensation realm?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. I went up and talked to him. I thought he was some genius that Teacher Jeeves unearthed. I figured that I could make a few connections. What a waste of 5 minutes.\"\n\nKarmin's ears perked up in earnest as he tuned into the hushed discussions lingering within the room. Even though he wasn't magically gifted, through his years of experience he had cultivated a set of skills. This set of skills had been perfected over his trials and tribulations running a business and raising it from the ground.\n\nHis most trusted and useful skill was the \"Ears of Chatter-Capture\". As the name suggested, Karmin had heightened his sense of hearing to pick up on pertinent information fluttering around him, regardless of how noisy the area or how muted the conversation may be. He had used this skill a lot in his youth, to clue in on particular market trends and fortuitous opportunities.\n\n\"Who knows though. Maybe he really is a hidden genius. You know how eccentric those guys can be. Like my uncle's friend's second son!\"\n\n\"Of course! Wasn't he recently picked up by a 3-star teacher because of his affinity in alchemy?\"\n\n\"That's the one! So anyway, that kid's real freaky. He likes to act as if he's some hidden bigshot. Speaks in riddles all the time- Excuse me, man? Can I help you?\"\n\nThe two mob characters interrupted their conversation and nudged Karmin, who was leaning in and poking his ear up against them.\n\n\"*cough* Sorry. I heard you guys talking about someone Teacher Jeeves sponsored?\" He asked awkwardly as he tried to divert their attention. He didn't know how the two figured out that he was eavesdropping in on their conversation.\n\nThe two looked at each other in irritation and pointed their chins simultaneously towards the corner of the room. Karmin bowed to show gratitude and slowly edged away.\n\n\"Who was that creep? Was he listening in on us?\"\n\n\"Wasn't it obvious? He was so close to us that he was practically a part of the conversation. What a weirdo!\"\n\nKarmin cursed out the two individuals under his breath while walking up to a man seated at the corner of the hall, alone. As Karmin approached him, he saw that the man was completely engrossed in the food in front of him. He was eating it as if he had been starved for days. He was so into it that he completely ignored the jeers and disdainful looks being directed his way from the people surrounding him.\n\nKarmin commended the man internally for his strength of character. Not many people could maintain their calm under such societal pressures. Then again, he did have Teacher Jeeves backing him up, such support warranted a carefree mind. And that rang true since none of those \"flies\" hovering around him deigned to cause any problems.\n\n\"Excuse me, is this seat taken?\" Karmin asked jovially while touching an empty seat in front of the man.\n\n\"Oh? No, it's not. Please,\" the man gestured as he pulled his platter closer.\n\nKarmin nodded while sitting down. He had accomplished the first part of the plan: making contact. Being someone without a noteworthy background, Karmin had realised quite early that his survival was contingent on his connections. He could not hold on to his gains using his own powers, even though he was now a wealthy and powerful individual.\n\nA lone tree bears the entire weight of a massive storm, while a forest with many trees can end the storm together. It was a phrase he had heard from a wandering philosopher in his youth. The crowd at that time dismissed it as the ramblings of a mentally affected man, but Karmin could gaze into the truths underlying those \"ramblings\". In this world, he was a mountain climber without a safety rope. If he wanted to survive, he needed to find a stable footing. Additionally, if he wanted to rise, he needed to do so in earnest.\n\nWith those principles in mind, Karmin made it a point to build strong connections no matter the situation. Trouble could come knocking without any warning, and he needed to have a way out.\n\nOthers determined that acquainting themselves with this ravenous man was a waste of time. On the surface, they saw a man without potential - an average Joe. But Karmin saw this as an opportunity. This man had the backing of a famous teacher, Al Jeeves. No one in the Solar Empire was ignorant of Al Jeeves' capabilities. The man was a legend!\n\nApart from Teacher Jeeves' bountiful experience, a vast sea of knowledge, and enigmatic strength, perhaps what he was best known for was his introversion and intense dislike for interaction. Many a famous individual had tried to and failed to gain the acquaintance of Teacher Jeeves.\n\nWith all that being said, how did this man manage to do it? This unassuming \"average Joe\" had accomplished something that others who were incontestably superior to him had failed to do. That, in and of itself, should warrant greater attention. But these numbskulls didn't have the patience or insight to make that connection.\n\n'There has to be a reason!' Karmin declared, 'If I can gain this person's favour, I may get a piece of the pie too!'\n\nAs he arrived at that conclusion, his lips stretched into his cheeks, and a cunning smile surfaced. It was time to initiate the second step: the probing.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Karmin Zola, a 2-star Smith,\" he said while stretching out his hand.\n\nThe introduction brought the man opposite out of his stupor and he too reciprocated after first cleaning his palm, \"Pleased to meet you. Guy Larks, teaching apprentice.\"\n\n'A firm handshake,' Karmin commented. Most of the time, the handshake could tell volumes about an individual. A firm and confident grip generally corresponded to a confident and stable personality.\n\n\"Sorry to disturb your lunch. It's just that I haven't seen you here before. Are you new?\" Karmin asked cordially. Although this small-talk was boring, it was a necessary prerequisite in prying through social walls.\n\n\"I guess you can say that,\" Guy replied with a wry smile. \"Can I help you?\"\n\nKarmin decided to take a large step forward. \"Oh no. If I am being honest, I was just interested in meeting the man who caught Teacher Jeeves' attention. He isn't known for being welcoming after all.\"\n\nGuy hummed in realisation as he replied, \"We're just casual friends. He's actually repaying a favour.\"\n\nKarmin's eyes widened, 'This is big news! Teacher Jeeves owed him a favour?'\n\nThis hinted to Karmin that the man before him was definitely special. Teacher Jeeves was an acclaimed powerhouse, and if there was something that even he couldn't accomplish and Guy could, all the more reason to build a robust connection with Guy.\n\n\"I don't want to pry,\" Karmin replied while shaking his hands. Sometimes, knowing too much can be just as bad as being ignorant. \"Anyways, is there anything I can help you with? I'm a long-standing member here. If you're ever in need of any assistance, or if you're unsure about something then please don't hesitate to ask.\"\n\nReaching into his jacket pocket, Karmin pulled out a circular token and placed it on the table, \"If you ever need to find me, just show this at the reception of The Burning Forge.\"\n\nOnce Karmin's fingers left the token, his eyes landed on Guy's face to observe his reaction. What he did just now was a presumptuous gambit. He was banking on a thin hope that Guy would be impressed by Karmin's fame and lower his guard. In fact, this was all he could do, if he had tried to initiate some forced conversation he would have only pushed Guy away.\n\nSurprisingly, Guy's reaction wasn't as Karmin had expected. The Burning Forge was a pretty big name in Radiant City, he had expected some derivative of awe to flash across Guy's face. Instead, Guy didn't even look at the plate. His eyes were solely trained on Karmin.\n\nGuy's gaze lasted for a while. It didn't waver, nor did it intensify. But Karmin felt as if he was being stripped down and observed; those eyes looked like they could pierce through any facade.\n\nKarmin was growing increasingly uncomfortable at being stared at like this. He thought that Guy was looking down on him for being \"just a smith\". That was a disconcerting conclusion, he hoped that Guy would be different. \n\nSuppressing his displeasure, Karmin stood up to leave, \"Well, I can see that you are busy, I won't take any more of your time.\"\n\nRight as he was about to turn, a calm and composed voice broke through the din, \"It's truly my luck to meet an accomplished individual such as yourself, Smith Zola.\"\n\nKarmin turned towards the voice and found that it originated from Guy. The man was now holding the token in his hands and observing it with an impressed expression, \"I'm grateful to have made your acquaintance. In fact, I do have a few problems that I'm struggling with. I would really appreciate it if you could offer me some guidance.\"\n\nGuy spoke courteously, without any underlying malice, disdain, or sarcasm in his tone. This came as a surprise to Karmin. He would be lying if he admitted that he wasn't prejudiced against mages. His entire life he had had to contend against them and stand out on his own. It wasn't a pleasant experience.\n\nKarmin sat down once again and entered the conversation with increased vigour, and sincerity. \n\nAlthough Karmin wasn't an enchanter, he wasn't ignorant of the craft. To sell something, one had to be knowledgeable about it first. That was the only way you could avoid making unnecessary losses and getting fleeced.\n\nGuy mainly asked questions regarding the basics of enchanting and smithing. The discussion hovered around the Practising or 1-star level and Karmin could easily clarify all of them. As the conversation advanced, Karmin felt that while Guy wasn't a typical genius, but the man was a hard worker and extremely knowledgeable. Karmin's impression of Guy reminded him of his youth. He remembered a time when he spent two sleepless days trying to perfect an advanced technique his master had developed. After he accomplished it, Karmin found that couldn't even lift a finger. As he conversed with Guy, Karmin found a lot of common traits he shared with him. Subconsciously, he started to find himself getting drawn over to Guy.\n\nAs the talks reached a lull, Guy carefully brought forward a request, \"I know that this is presumptuous, seeing as how we just met. But I have a request-\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-039]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":181,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 037 - Smithing and Enchanting Guild","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nA guild is an association or congregation that oversees the practice of one particular trade, craft or profession. In this world, guilds were established to regulate certain systems that transcended political and geographical boundaries. This was because the two factors, politics and geography, are always in flux.\n\nFor instance, let's assume that the oversight of one particular trade, craft or profession is performed by one political entity such as the Solar Empire. Although it may look stable at the current time point, there is no guarantee that the dynasty will persist a hundred years from now. This uncertainty does not bode well for the aforementioned systems since the turnover of control following the fall of one dynasty and the rise of another is often succeeded by a mass cleansing and rebuilding of pre-established infrastructure.\n\nAlong the same lines, it is also possible for the entity that takes on the responsibility to oversee the trades, crafts and professions to tamper with the economics of the particular fields resulting in instability, loss of work, monopolisation, and so on.\n\nTherefore, early on, groups of individuals specialising in these systems came together and established guilds to tackle this problem.\n\nIn fact, there are a plethora of guilds present in this world, ranging from fields that are tied to magecraft, and those that aren't such as merchant's guild, playwright's guild, sailor's guild, and so on.\n\nThese guilds work to level the playing field so that new entrants and old members can both flourish without conflicting with each other's interests. They also work by keeping records and publicising key information amongst their members so that the area the guild specialises in can persevere and flourish.\n\nIt is to be noted that guilds cannot interfere with the workings of businesses and organisations apart from enforcing strict standards and market regulation laws. This is so that there is a clear baseline governing everything, which persists universally.\n\nThe Smithing and Enchanting Guild is special in that it is actually an amalgamation of two guilds. Due to the bond that is shared between the two crafts, the executive members from the two guilds felt that it would be beneficial to tie the knot and merge. Thus, the new guild catered to both the mortal folk that practised smithing and the mages that specialised in enchanting.\n\nWhile the marriage between the two guilds was harmonious on paper, it wasn't the case when observed under a microscope. Two tigers may have the same eating behaviour and it may seem logical to place them in close vicinity of each other, but as the old adage states, \"one mountain cannot contain two tigers.\"\n\nEnchanting is in many ways an extension of smithing. This meant that an enchanter could find work as a smith during off times. While this may be advantageous for the enchanter, it is not the case for the many nonmagical smiths that are left unemployed. Essentially, organisations felt that it was economical to hire one enchanter to double as a regular smith while paying them a slightly higher salary.\n\nOn that note, it is not accurate to write off smithing as inferior to enchanting. In a world that is primarily inhabited by nonmagical beings, a regular weapon, armour or trinket is more beneficial than one which is enchanted because the user cannot activate and sustain the powers contained in the enchanted item with a measly mana pool. However, a single enchanted item can contend with multiple unenchanted items of the same type.\n\nUltimately, this led to a massive lay-off of smiths all across the world. With the economic powers shifting in favour of the enchanters, it resulted in the formation of a hierarchical split. The enchanters started to enforce their superiority amongst their fellow smiths both through monetary advantage and martial superiority and started to further encroach into the nonmagical smiths' businesses.\n\nThis disparity nearly evolved into a full-blown conflict between the two parties and threatened to split apart the guild from its roots. However, the executive members managed to quench the spreading embers by drawing clear boundaries and establishing strict non-compete clauses in the way the members could operate. \n\nThey implemented a law that restricted licensed enchanters from working as smiths, lest they face harsh fines and possible expulsion from the guild's ranks. This meant that once an individual earned an enchanter's license, they were no longer allowed to sell nonmagical artefacts in the regulated markets. They also established additional measures to ensure that the nonmagical smiths weren't suppressed and could afford equal benefits as their enchanter comrades, such as purchasing priorities and so on.\n\nWith these new laws, the new guild began behaving like a couple in a shaky marriage. Neither side interfered with the other's interest, but they still maintained a facade of content matrimony.\n\nTo date, tensions persist between nonmagical smiths and enchanters. However, due to the existence of the guild's bylaws, both sides have to put up with each other and rough it through the conflicts.\n\nAs a result of these laws, businesses nowadays that want to sell both enchanted and unenchanted items have to contract smiths and enchanters to forge them respectively. Karmin Zola was a 2-star Smith who was currently facing a grave problem because of this requirement.\n\nHe was a 39-year-old man who had an air of maturity around him, which was cultivated through his tumultuous and rigorous life. As a son of an insignificant peasant, Karmin toiled diligently to enter the apprenticeship of a local smith and later graduated at a record speed of four years.\n\nFrom a young age, Karmin had ambition and wanted to become rich. During his youth, due to the growing tensions between nations, he decided to become a smith to supply weaponry when the impending war finally broke out. His speculation rang true just a year after his graduation when a massive conflict erupted between the Solar Empire and the neighbouring Blackstar Kingdom. Karmin quickly offloaded his accumulated wares and earned a fortune, which he later invested to start his own blacksmithing business.\n\nKarmin wasn't a genius, and he knew that. Even though he graduated from apprenticeship much earlier than others, it wasn't because he was an accomplished individual. He worked himself to the bone and rushed through the whole process just so that he could get himself up and running before the war struck. Evidently, his gambit paid off handsomely and he walked out with enough capital to self-fund his venture.\n\nYet, once he entered the market, Karmin quickly figured out that as an unlicensed practitioner, his business couldn't compete with others that were backed by a licensed smith. Those businesses were offered greater opportunities, lower purchasing prices, a wider pool of markets, and many other subsidised benefits.\n\nKarmin wasn't stupid. He knew that there would be no future for him if he decided to toil along as an unlicensed smith. While he could still make a living, it would only be enough for him to pass his days peacefully. That was not what he had set out to do initially.\n\nAs a capable businessman, Karmin was quick to identify his weaknesses and equally quick in addressing them. He immediately applied for a smithing practitioner's license and passed the test with his robust foundations.\n\nAlthough he could've pushed ahead and tested for the 1-star license, Karmin decided to maintain caution and worked towards it steadily. He had observed many upstart smiths, without any background, rising up the ranks too quickly and getting railroaded into an unfavourable position. He obtained his 1-star license within five years, and the 2-star license in seven. With an increase in stars, his business started to flourish and his coffers began overflowing.\n\nVery quickly, though, Karmin faced his first roadblock. He found that his business could not expand any further with his 2-star license. He thought of working towards a 3-star license, but Karmin realised that it was only advisable if he wanted to pursue a researching track. As a businessman, 2-stars was sufficient.\n\nHe considered contracting a more advanced smith, but he dropped that idea as well after he realised that the process would not be so simple. Taking in a 3-star smith would require him to hand over a sizeable portion of his revenues to them as payment for their loyalty. That didn't sit right with Karmin. He was the one who worked his ass off and built the business from scratch. Why should he hand over a part of it to someone else?\n\nThat left him with one final option, expanding horizontally. In simpler terms, if increasing the scope of the business within the current field was not optimal, why not expand into another, similar field? Thus, Karmin decided to start selling enchanted items through his business.\n\nThough this led to another blockade. As he was already well into his middle ages, he had missed the most optimal time to enter the path of magic. When he was younger, he lacked resources, but as an adult, he lacked the vigour and malleability of youth. It truly was a dreary prospect. Karmin began brainstorming possible solutions, but he ended up short in nearly all of them.\n\nBecause he frenziedly worked through the ranks to reach his current position, Karmin had put off marriage and siring offspring. Resultantly, he lacked heirs that he could depend on to become enchanters and possibly support his business. He considered adoption, however, he wasn't confident in their loyalties.\n\nUltimately, he was only left with one option and that was to hire an enchanter. Luckily, due to the guild's bylaws, a 1-star enchanter was equally ranked as a 1-star smith, even though the former was technically a mage. This meant he didn't have to sacrifice an arm and a leg to bring one into his business.\n\nStill, that didn't mean that an enchanter's ego was at the same level. Due to their affinity to magic, enchanters felt themselves superior to Karmin, even though his net worth was a hundred times their's.\n\nHe had tried catering to some of their interests and bending over a little. But those pricks didn't cede even a little ground. Most of them didn't even bother meeting him.\n\nWith his shoulders hung low, Karmin trudged through the guild's entrance and walked towards the Networking Hall.\n\nThe Networking Hall was technically a mess hall that was open to the guild personnel and members. They would serve food three times a day. Its alternate purpose was to act as a means of connecting with other members of guilds. Many partnerships and ventures were birthed in this hall.\n\nKarmin didn't hold much hope, but he wanted to give it his all, just like everything he had attempted in his life.\n\nRight as he entered the hall, an interesting conversation brushed past his ears.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-038]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":182,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 036 - Inscribing Mana Gems","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nAs Al had explained before, the method used to enchant weapons, armours and other such items was through inscribing and embedding mana gems.\n\nBut what are mana gems?\n\nMana that exists in the environment permeates through everything living and nonliving. As Mast explained before, it can bend and twist the natural laws by shoehorning itself in between.\n\nFollowing this property, many naturally occurring metals, minerals and organic matter have been in one way or another affected due to the presence of mana. Mana gems are one example of this deviance.\n\nNaturally occurring minerals such as diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, rubies and so on form due to natural processes such as heat and pressure. During their formation, it is possible for mana to enter into the mix. This mana could contain an elemental alignment depending on where this is taking place. If the gems are forming under a volcano or lava pool, there can be an abundance of earth and fire-aligned mana. If this mana is sufficiently concentrated, it can exist in liquid or even solid-crystal form. If they mix in with the mineral crystals, the result is a lustrous gem with a natural affinity to the alignment of mana present during its formation.\n\nThis is one particular scenario. If such minerals are being formed in a deep-sea trench or a large mana abundant water body, the gem may be water-aligned. Essentially, the mana gem's \"flavour\" depends on the conditions during its formation while in the presence of a large concentration of mana. Similarly, it is also possible to find mana gems with no affinity to any particular element. These are the more commonly found gems in the market.\n\nMany mages have tried to artificially form these mana gems and have succeeded, but only to an extent. The artificially formed mana gems tended to have lower affinity and were less efficient. That is, the amount of mana required to form them was astronomical and the yield was extremely low compared to the reagents used.\n\nIn the beginning, these mana gems were solely used for decoration and simple operations such as coloured lighting. However, with the loss of Dwarven enchantments, enchanters began to experiment with these mana gems and found their effectiveness when embedded in items.\n\nTo be of use for enchanting, these gems had to be inscribed with the specific enchantment.\n\nThis begged the question, how do you inscribe on a mana gem?\n\nThe process is extremely complicated as it requires a steady hand from the enchanter and dextrous penmanship.\n\nAn enchanter uses an inscribing tool to inscribe the required construct inside the gem. The inscribing tool appears similar to a fountain pen, however, its tip is made of a sharp and hollow gem called a mana diamond. These gems are extremely rare to find and the process through which they are cut and treated to form these tool-tips is complex in and of itself. The tip is attached to a hollow tube-like body made of a ductile and highly heat insulative material.\n\nThe tubing is filled with the inscribing ink which is magically activated when it passes through the tool-tip. Once activated by the mana diamond, the ink turns corporeal, and the mage must complete the precise inscription in one go at a constant rate. Once the inscription pauses, the corporeal construct shrinks and enters the mana gem. After this point, the inscription on the gem is permanent. If there is a failure then the gem is a dud and cannot be used for anything else apart from decoration.\n\nOn the other hand, if the inscription is successful, the gem can be embedded into the prepared item through a simple process. But embedding is not as straightforward as sticking the gem into any location on the item.\n\nDuring the forging or making of the item, the enchanter needs to nudge and shape the naturally forming mana channels so that they complement the final enchantment. Similar to the way the modular spells work, these mana channels need to connect the gems to be embedded into the weapon and form a closed circuit. The process of moving the mana channels can be an astronomical task requiring a lot of mana and mana control. And usually, when embedding multiple gems, these channels need to be extended, turned and twisted by a lot. Therefore, more advanced enchanters need to naturally have a higher cultivation realm.\n\nWith regards to the inscribing process, the enchanter must also take into consideration the alignment of the enchantment, the gem, as well as the inscribing ink and its constituents.\n\nAn earth-type enchantment or spell works best when inscribed in an earth-aligned mana gem. Depending on the tier of the enchantment, a larger mana gem may be required. The size of the mana gem corresponds to the capacity of mana it can naturally hold.\n\nIt is possible to inscribe a water-type enchantment on an earth gem, but its effectiveness may be reduced. However, if there is a natural opposition between the gem's alignment and the spell, a catastrophic result can be expected.\n\nThe inscribing ink is somewhat similar. The ink used for enchantment needs to support the type of enchantment as well as the gem. Many enchanters have special ink formulas and compositions that work well with their specialised enchantments. These ink formulae are usually trade secrets meant to be passed down through the generations. But one thing all inscribing inks have in common is Mithril.\n\nMithril falls under a special type of metal found in nature called mana metals. They are somewhat similar to mana gems in that they are a complex amalgamation of naturally occurring metals and concentrated mana.\n\nThrough various tests, mage researchers found that mithril is an alloy made purely of silver and mana in equal proportions. It is also one of the most mana conductive metals in existence.\n\nIt is naturally found in a solid, dull crystalline ore. However, once it is extracted it turns into a lustrous liquid at room temperature. Yet, the special property of mithril is that once it reaches room temperature, it quickly fuses with any material it comes into contact with and hardens.\n\nThis is why pure mithril needs to be stored in its molten form at high temperatures.\n\nThe way it is used for enchanting is as follows. Enchanters bring together the ingredients for the inscription and pour it into the inscribing tool. They then pour in a specific ratio of molten mithril into the tool and allow the mixture to become perfectly homogeneous. As this molten liquid flows through the mana diamond it is activated causing it to turn corporeal, and the rest of the steps remain constant.\n\nThe ratio of ingredients to mithril is carefully determined through multiple trials and errors. Mages can sometimes spend years on end tweaking their formula to get the perfect ratio.\n\nOnce the inscribed ink affixes itself into the gem, the mithril within the mixture joins up the mana channels on the embedded item and completes the circuit.\n\nIn this way, an enchanter needs to consider the end before beginning their operation. Enchanting is a highly complicated procedure requiring a lot of patience and steadiness.\n\nThis entire process was described in a single book which acted as a primer for beginner enchanters. Within the same book were basic enchantments that they needed to get proficient with, which also acted as springboards into the more complicated enchantments later on.\n\nOnce Guy finished reading through the book, he concluded that for his objective he needed to become proficient in inscribing. And for that, he would have to practice doing it multiple times to get a hang of it.\n\nAll in all, Guy found that there were a lot of things he needed to do to accomplish his goal.\n\nHe had to source the appropriate body to hold the enchantment, he needed to determine the required enchantment to be inscribed into the gem, he needed to choose the appropriate type of gem, he needed to determine what inscribing ink to use, and finally, he needed to practice inscribing, embedding and maybe forging.\n\nAll of these tasks were dependent on one another and they couldn't be prioritised one over the other. This alone was a massive dilemma for Guy, and he knew that given the time limits, he had to be efficient.\n\nWith slumped shoulders, Guy sat down and started to write down how he would go about it.\n\nBased on a superficial analysis, Guy decided to set inscribing practice as something to begin immediately. He couldn't delay this because once he accomplished all the other tasks he would have to straight away begin with the inscribing process. He did debate on whether to perform the inscribing by himself or ask Al to help him out. But he apprehensive about the latter idea.\n\n'I've already asked Al for a lot. I'll try to do it by myself. If things don't pan out by the deadline, then I'll ask Al.'\n\nThe inscribing ink, gem and body choice were grouped together as they were interdependent. He had a gist of what type of enchantment to apply in the gem, but he recognised that additional tests and tailoring would also be required.\n\nWith all of that finalised, Guy heaved a long and exhausted sigh, stood up from his igloo of books, and stretched his body.\n\nEven with the prospect of having a monumental and possibly unachievable workload, Guy actually felt a little relaxed. Having a specific goal to work towards was always better than stumbling around in the dark.\n\nIt was at that moment that a bunch of knots in Guy's mind all unclasped at the same time. With a mix of concern and excitement, Guy psyched himself up to get down to business.\n\n\"Grrrrowwwwl\" But he was immediately interrupted by his stomach calling out for sustenance. Guy realised that he was so absorbed in research that he had nearly missed lunchtime.\n\nThe guild cafeteria would only remain open for fixed periods daily, and he couldn't afford to miss a free lunch!\n\n\"Food first, then work!\" Guy muttered as he left the book repository.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-037]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":183,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 035 - Preliminary Survey","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy's method of research was to work from the top down. After determining the endpoint, he would map out the required prerequisite topics by working downwards. This would narrow the field when he finally started to research and would greatly reduce the chances of going down unnecessary rabbit holes.\n\nBut before that, Guy felt it would be more efficient to run a preliminary survey. This was basically like a surface scan of publications to find out if there were already specific examples that conformed to the search criteria. Back on Earth, technology had advanced sufficiently that if anyone was attempting to start a new project, there was a high chance that something similar was already available on the internet. \n\nGuy believed that since the field of enchanting has existed in this world for at least 5000 years, there must be some publications that could address his dilemma.\n\nThe end goal for him was to enchant some form of a weapon that would assist Markus in casting ranged spells. An obvious starting point would be to determine the weapons that already conformed to that requirement. However, when Guy started his search with that parameter he was immediately stumped.\n\nUnlike alchemy, medicine, beast taming, and other licenced professions, enchanting was special in that there wasn't a fixed methodology when it came to it. There could be countless ways for an enchanter to create a weapon that could summon a wave of fire, just by varying the type of enchantment, gem selections, embedding format, weapon material type, inscription ink composition, and so on.\n\nThese variables would effectively change the efficiency, efficacy, functionality, and even aesthetics of the enchanted weapon.\n\nThis inherent variability in enchanting was a headache for Guy because apart from the small selection of books that covered the basics, almost the entire library was filled with books that were isolated case studies or process journals that described a renowned enchanter's attempts at creating an enchanted item.\n\nIt could be analogous to if Newton had published over a hundred journals describing the gravitational interactions between different household objects and the Earth, instead of a small handful that culminated his theory on gravitation. However, Guy realised that this comparison was flawed, in that gravitation could be generalised using the scientific process as it was a consistent phenomenon. But mana tended to screw things up big time.\n\nGuy summarised it through the principles of combinations and permutations in mathematics. Imagine that given a complete deck of cards, we have to form a hand of five cards. A combination is defined as a set of unique selections you can make from the deck of cards to form a hand. In that, the order of selection is irrelevant, only the content of the hand matters. However, a permutation also considers the order in which the selections are made. Therefore while we can form exactly 2,598,960 combinations of a five-card hand, given that a hand of five cards can be ordered 120 different ways, there are actually 311,875,200 unique permutations.\n\nWith the advent of mana in this world, even if the enchanted fire sword had the same combination of components, there could be infinite permutations, all of which would result in some variations in the final product. And each of these variations warranted documentation, which resulted in a highly padded book repository.\n\nThankfully, searching through these books for specific examples wasn't that huge of an issue because the repository had a comprehensive sorting strategy in place and a searching index that could magically direct you towards a shelf with books matching your search parameters. The index resembled a regular book, however, its page's were all empty. When someone used the quill next to the book to write in words that corresponded to a topic they were interested in, the ink marks on the pages would magically morph into coordinates of shelves or rows that matched those words.\n\nThe index is a Legendary grade enchanted item, albeit one of the most basic of its kind, and is present in all the renowned Smithing and Enchanting Guilds across Gaea. It contains multiple enchantments as well as a nascent will that learns and grows through repeated use. To an extent, its behaviour mimics the adaptive algorithms and models that underly modern search engines on Earth - it was like a magically supercharged search engine. Guy was enraptured by how the item worked, but he couldn't afford to waste time following that tangent!\n\nGuy approached the index and started by writing in: \"ranged\", and \"spell casting\". To which the index spasmed and threw up multiple pages worth of directions.\n\n\"I guess the search was too broad,\" Guy said while smiling bitterly. After waiting for the index to erase itself, he wrote in additional keywords to narrow the search. Including \"ranged\" and \"spell casting\", he also wrote \"multiple spells\", \"active-type\" and \"low cost\".\n\nHe had multiple reasons for using these parameters. First, the enchanted item must accommodate multiple spells, otherwise, Markus would have to switch between enchanted items in the middle of combat. That wasn't safe and was therefore unfeasible.\n\nHe also included the keyword \"active-type\" to ensure that the enchantments were conjurable or triggered. That is, when activated, the enchanted item would trigger a spell or conjure a phenomenon. This is opposed to the \"passive-type\" enchantments that are always active and constantly affect either the item, the user, or the surrounding in some way.\n\nFinally, Guy didn't have much to his name. He could borrow from Al and pay it off later, but honestly, Guy wasn't confident about it. And so, he needed to find a solution that could accommodate multiple castable spells while remaining affordable.\n\nAs Guy thought about it, he shook his head in disappointment. For an enchanted item to cast multiple spells it would have to be a Unique grade. That automatically made things difficult because one, it would use a lot of resources to create and two, it would be difficult to make. To put it in context, creating a Unique grade item was the passing criteria for a 2-star enchanter's license.\n\nAnd much like he had predicted, the solutions that were provided by the index all corresponded to Unique grade enchanted items forged by others.\n\nAnother problem that Guy identified was that in none of these case studies was the enchanted item capable of casting more than two ranged spells. Based on the explanation provided in those books, it was because embedding multiple gems with active-type spells could damage the item through mana corrosion. That is when a large quantity of mana is forced to flow through narrow channels multiple times.\n\nTherefore, Guy scrapped this search and pondered for a while. Evidently, his search could be narrowed further to meet his needs.\n\nAfter a while, Guy wrote in a new set of search parameters into the index. Including \"ranged\" and \"spell casting\", he wrote \"active-type\" and \"low cost\", however instead of multiple spells he wrote in \"variable enchantment\".\n\nGuy realised that he could go about the problem with a different approach. Rather than searching for items with enchantments that were static, was it possible to have an enchantment that could change depending on the situation? Something similar to his modular spells?\n\nHe posited that someone must have already tested out this line of inquiry, and his search confirmed that proposition by providing him with a single case study in which a group of enchanters tried to create an enchantment that could change depending on the need of the mage. The book went into a lot of detail about their thought process and their choices, but in the end, they arrived at a single conclusion: It wasn't a worthwhile endeavour.\n\nTheir enchantment worked by having the ink that was engraved into the gem morph into the spell constructs that the user wanted. The result showed promise, however, they couldn't make it take the form of more complex spells. They considered experimenting further, but they quickly realised that beyond a certain point the spell constructs were so convoluted that the mage couldn't mentally form it inside the gem. They would have to give it their full attention or else it would mess up.\n\nGuy was overjoyed at finding a lead. Even though the enchanters chose not to pursue it any further, the mere fact that it was possible to create a variable enchantment was akin to a bright light at the end of a dark and seemingly endless tunnel.\n\nTherefore, Guy updated his plan of action and set this variable enchantment case study as his end goal. Using that, he worked backwards and mapped out everything he would need as a prerequisite.\n\nAs he stared at the blooming mind map in his RoK, his eyes stopped over one particular checkpoint, and his brows scrunched up.\n\nEnchanting consisted of two parts, the first was smithing, which involved making the item to be enchanted, and the second was enchanting.\n\nAlthough Guy didn't have any hands-on experience from his previous life, he admitted that he had a perfunctory understanding of smithing. However enchanting was a whole another deal. It was completely novel to him!\n\nHe knew that if he wanted to create the variable enchantment he would need to have the basic knowledge of this topic. And so Guy got down to researching it.\n\nWhat he found through a precursory search was that enchantments were added to weapons by embedding mana gems on them. And not just any regular mana gem, but ones that were inscribed with the enchantment you wanted.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-036]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":184,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 034 - Researching for a Solution","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nA heavy-set woman with impeccably defined musculature walked into the Smithing and Enchanting Guild Manager's office with a stack of documents in her hands.\n\nShe carefully placed it on the desk while speaking cordially to the well-built, middle-aged man hunched over an open book, \"Enchanter Lynn, here are the approved material requisition forms from this week. There appears to be an increase in demand for orichalcum following Enchanter Rain's Earthsplitter Axe which was auctioned off recently.\" \n\nGoro Lynn nodded while moving the stack before him, \"That's to be expected, after all. Make sure to increase the next order for earth-aligned mana gems as well. I know that we have a sufficient amount for the time being, but those novices will start experimenting willy-nilly and use them all up almost instantly.\"\n\nThe woman smiled and assured, \"Already done! The new logistics department head is quick to take initiative. He's come up with a unique stocking strategy that predicts resource requirements based on trends.\"\n\nGoro smiled and got down to perusing the forms in front of him. As he was doing so, he saw the woman hesitating to speak from the corner of his vision.\n\n\"What is it?\" He asked without diverting his attention from the documents.\n\n\"Well, it's about the man Teacher Jeeves endorsed...\" she commented in a low voice.\n\nGoro sighed while dropping the paper in his hand, \"What about him?\"\n\n\"He's been holed up in the book repository for over two weeks now. I thought he'd try asking for assistance or guidance, but the man is like a reading machine. What are we supposed to do with him?\"\n\nGoro chuckled bitterly, \"Leave it. I owed Al a favour, this was him cashing it in.\"\n\n\"But the repository is off-limits to non-licensed Smiths and Enchanters...\"\n\nGoro clicked his tongues as he interrupted her, \"Whatever the case! As long as the man isn't doing anything disruptive, let him go about it however he wants. If anyone higher-up starts asking questions, tell them I allowed it. Oh, and if the man asks for anything, as long as it isn't too excessive just comply with the requests. Make sure to log it in Teacher Jeeves' tab.\"\n\nIn a low whisper, the woman asked, \"Is the man some kind of a genius? Is he Teacher Jeeves' new apprentice?\"\n\nGoro shrugged and retorted, \"Who knows what happens inside that old monster's head. In any case, it's better that he cashed in that favour on such a simple request. I worried he'd ask for something beyond my capacity...\"\n\nThe woman then bowed respectfully and left the room, leaving Goro by himself. As he returned to the stack once again, he sighed, \"Who am I kidding? This barely covers my favour. I know he'll come back and ask for something insane later.\"\n\n____\n\nGuy had been camping out in the Smithing and Enchanting Guild's internal book repository for over two weeks now. After his last meeting with Al, the senior teacher had brought him here and cashed in favour to allow Guy access to the books as well as a few basic resources from the guild.\n\nFollowing that, Guy quite literally moved into the place, leaving only to relieve himself and eat for sustenance. He had become a sorry sight, with overgrown facial hair and dark circles flanking his eyes. The last time he looked like this was when he was 18 years old and got locked inside his University's library right before Thanksgiving break. He fell asleep just as the library locked up. And due to a heavy snowstorm, he was stuck inside for an entire week without any cell or internet connection. Thankfully, the library's cafeteria was stocked with food, or he feared that he would have died early and missed his chance to transmigrate.\n\nBack to the situation at hand. Guy's primary purpose in holing up inside the repository was to follow up on the hints provided by Al. According to him, a mage of a lower level could cast higher-tier spells with the help of enchanted weapons. This was something Markus needed, and so as his teacher, it was Guy's duty to pursue the option as best as possible.\n\nUnfortunately, neither the present Guy nor the original Guy was inducted in Smithing and Enchanting.\n\nSo it was only natural for Guy to hit up the Smithing and Enchanting Guild in Radiant City. He could join up, attempt the practising license and then work towards the 1-star license to gain access to the more advanced books in the internal repositories.\n\nAlas, his plans were shattered once he realised just how long the whole thing would take.\n\nCompared to alchemy, the field of smithing and enchanting was much more arduous solely because it comprised of two similar yet equally difficult subjects: smithing and enchanting.\n\nSmithing is by and large a mortal craft. Anyone can become a smith, and through practice and hard work they can become veritable experts in the craft. There isn't a stringent barrier for entry. However, an enchanted weapon is to an extent an extension of the smithing craft, yet a little different.\n\nA weapon crafted by a pure weaponsmith cannot always be enchanted. And a weapon crafted to be enchanted is always inferior to a similarly graded weapon forged by a pure weaponsmith. One can enchant a weapon to be Empowered, or they can forge an unenchanted weapon out of stronger metal. However, an unenchanted weapon cannot cast any spells, while an enchanted weapon can.\n\nThis dichotomy is what makes smithing and enchanting a difficult field to get into. First off, even the most experienced of smiths have to first unlearn their skills to start as enchanters. Most of the knowledge they would have learned during their apprenticeship may not be applicable when it comes to enchanting a forged weapon.\n\nOn that note, a craftsman capable of forging and creating weapons and armours without enchantments is called a smith. A smith with the knowledge and capacity to enchant weapons, armours or any other items is called an enchanter.\n\nTherefore, enchanting can only be attempted by a mage that is at least near the Foundation Establishment realm. This is because mana perceptivity is a prerequisite in enchanting an item.\n\nEnchanters must take note of nascent mana pathways in the items being forged and actively tailor them to fit the needs of the enchantment which will be applied once finished. Generic weapon and armoursmiths do not, and cannot, take them into account and thus the produced item is usually unenchantable. To be precise, it may be enchanted, however, it may not be as efficient or effective.\n\nTherefore, while Guy could achieve a practising license, the 1-star license would take him more than a year, which was well beyond the deadline. He needed to first become a capable smith, and then pick up basic enchanting to succeed in the 1-star license test.\n\nHowever, after some consideration, Guy figured that it was possible that the 1-star license tested smithing and enchanting holistically. Since his needs were narrow, maybe being an accomplished enchanter was unnecessary. If he could become learned in enchanting specifically for Markus' needs, he wouldn't have to go through the entire process.\n\nWhen he brought up this hypothesis in front of Al, he also agreed with Guy. Therefore, using Al's backing, Guy received the green light to access the internal repositories without achieving the 1-star license.\n\nGuy spent the first few days perusing through the basics to get a crash course in smithing and enchanting. Unsurprisingly, these included a run-through of the tools and materials used in the profession. It discussed the widely used metals, how they are extracted, their treatment methods, how mana channels can be drawn into forged items, how specific tools can be used during smithing and enchantment. It also went through a brief history of enchanting, even going as far as to compare the current state of enchanted weapons versus the Dwarven kind.\n\nIt was an enlightening trip for Guy, and it gave him a clearer direction on what to research. As a teacher, Guy had to constantly keep himself updated on the new developments in the world so that he could communicate with his students. It wasn't an uncommon occurrence for one of his students to offhandedly talk about a particular discovery they heard in the news. \n\nIt was common for kids to view their teachers as all-knowing entities, and thus Guy's students would often start a discussion with him regarding these novel topics. To facilitate discussion, Guy needed to have at least a superficial understanding of what they were talking about, lest he flounders around like a headless chicken, making a fool of himself and misdirecting his students. He only had to point them in a direction and provide an appropriate line of research, the kids could do the rest if they were interested in pursuing it further. He would even encourage them to present it to him, or in front of the class as an exercise.\n\nAs a result, Guy had perfected the process of research over years of trial and error. And using this skill, he mapped out a feasible research track.\n\nBarring the field of forging and smithing as a whole, Guy decided that the first item for business was to determine if there was already a published and credible solution to his predicament.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-035]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":185,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 033 - Age of Isolation","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nWhat are realms? The descriptions provided in most early literature were fuzzy when touching on this topic. Most of them suggested that a realm might be a plane, or world, that existed parallel to the current one. They concluded on this based on the fact that the observed constellations in the night sky weren't the same across different realms.\n\nBut another literature refuted that claim by determining that while the constellations differed, if some constellations in specific planes were viewed from a different perspective or reconstruction they sometimes did mimic constellations from the current realm. This led them to believe that maybe these realms weren't actually set in different planes, but were rather within the same plane of existence.\n\nA few mage powerhouses decided to test this theory and ventured beyond the confines of Gaea. Once they managed to break free from the strong pull, they started to explore the other bodies scattered across the void.\n\nThrough a generic survey, the mages found that a lot of these planets were uninhabitable. While they did find a few that displayed hints of life, they concluded that it was still impossible for humans to migrate there and thrive. Once mages started to venture further, beyond the immediate vicinity of their current planetary congregation, they found it difficult to maintain their bearings. The void wasn't as empty as they had initially predicted. Many malicious and unknown phenomenon lurked in the darkness that swallowed and waylaid unsuspecting mages.\n\nEventually, it was unanimously decided that it wasn't safe to venture farther into the void to verify the single realm theory. And thus, the definition of realms still remains a contested topic across different mage circles.\n\nAcross Gaea, there existed multiple transit points borne of natural magic that acted as portals into different realms. Luckily, or maybe it was a conscious outcome, these realms accessible from the transit points were all inhabitable for human beings, although not all of them were typically safe.\n\nThe Fae Realm, as it was called, lead to a planet filled with towering greenery and massive beasts. Mage explorers discovered that the Fae Realm could be around ten times the size of Gaea. The dominant, and well-known, species in the Fae Realm were the Elves and they were known for their inherent connection with nature and their uncanny ability to tame and rear beasts. Other humanoid species that were indigenous to this realm were Orcs, Goblins and Kobolds.\n\nAnother realm accessible from Gaea was the Fel Realm. Like its name suggested, this realm was brutal and unforgiving. It was much larger than the Fae Realm and was filled with treacherous forests, abyssal waters, labyrinthian caverns and raging volcanoes. The only humanoid species that thrived in these lands were the Dwarves. Unlike their tall and fairy-like counterparts from the Fae Realm, these hardheaded and physical species were naturally short in stature and prioritised practicality over superficial beauty. Evidently, the Dwarves weren't an aesthetically gifted race. But what they lacked in appearance, they made up in spades in strength and craftsmanship.\n\nTo survive in the Fel Realm, even the nonmagical had to have a degree of proficiency with weapons and armour. This led to the Dwarven species building their entire civilisation around smithing and enchanting. It was so deeply ingrained into their lives that even their history and mythology was directly connected to legendary weapons, armours or trinkets used by famous figures.\n\nDue to the existence of these transit points, the exchange of information was unperturbed. However, since smithing and enchanting was the glue that held the Dwarven civilisation together, they were naturally averse to disclosing their secrets to others.\n\nThat just wouldn't do! It was an indisputable fact that Dwarven weapons were superior. In many wars, victory hinged on the fact that one side had more Dwarven forged products over the other. So if it was impossible to learn the Dwarven method, nor was it feasible to purchase and hoard Dwarven made products, why not hoard Dwarves themselves?\n\nIt was an absurd conclusion, yet one that picked up steam very quickly. At first, organisations simply inducted Dwarves into their order and raised them organically, just like any typical expert. However, one particular human sect decided to enslave Dwarves en masse, just because they didn't have the monetary power to support them.\n\nThe Dwarves were stubborn and unyielding folk. They were eventually submitted to the enslavers through force but they staunchly refused to disclose their enchanting method. Nonetheless, the enslavers were satisfied with receiving a regular supply of enchanted weapons, armours and trinkets for free.\n\nThe practice caught on eventually after the enslaving sect won multiple battles consecutively. Even more, organisations started enslaving Dwarves into their fold. The Dwarves weren't the only species that experienced such tragedies. Some organisations even enslaved some Elven races for their abilities in beast taming - using them as specialised shock units in their armies.\n\nBut everything came to an end around 5000 years ago, during the Age of Isolation. \n\nIt was unknown as to how it happened, but a lot of the transit points that acted as gateways between realms started to get severed simultaneously. Many believed that it was the act of an omniscient being, lamenting over the brutalities committed during those times.\n\nWhile some transit points to smaller realms still remained, Gaea was isolated from the Fae and the Fel Realm. The remnants from those realms that remained eventually succumbed to the ravages of time, and took with them their knowledge and expertise.\n\n\"So you're saying that this sword is a result of slavery?\" Guy asked with a disgusted undertone. With his modern sensibilities, he was extremely averse to the idea of slavery. The brutal and inhuman history from his old world had cemented this ideology into his core.\n\nAl shook his head and clarified, \"This is the work of a genuine and untethered craftsman. I've seen the works of enslaved Dwarves. It lacks life. It's hard to explain, but you'll understand it once you see it for yourself.\"\n\nAl exhaled loudly and continued, \"Humans didn't know what to do at that point. There was a sudden lack of enchanted weapons, and Dwarves to supply them. And so, mages set out to find ways to replicate the works of Dwarves the best they could. Dwarven enchantment is special, in that it was passive and organic. As you saw before, there was a very little delay between when I intended for the enchantment to activate, and when it actually activated. It is as if the weapon, and its enchantment, are an extension of my body.  \nThe Dwarves would separate enchanted weapons into 4 categories. Excluding the gradations assigned to forged item quality, enchanted items could be Common, Unique, Epic, or Legendary. Any successfully enchanted item would qualify for a Common grade, but the ones that exhibit two or more enchantments are classified as Unique. Epic enchanted items have the special ability to grow with the user, as in they get stronger the more they are used for the purpose they are forged for. Finally, Legendary enchanted items have the properties of the preceding grade. However, they have an additional property of exhibiting limited sentience. It's as if the weapon itself has a nascent will.\"\n\n\"We have been able to replicate these abilities, but our solutions barely meet their Dwarven equivalents through direct comparisons. As a 2-star Blacksmith and Enchanter, I can create these Unique enchanted weapons. But you can already see that my sword cannot match up to a Dwarven Common enchanted sword,\" Al said while smiling ruefully. \"The latency between my intent and activation is much wider, and the effect itself is greatly muted.\"\n\n\"The way we've been able to replicate Dwarven enchantment is by using these things called Mana Gems,\" Al said while pointing at the minerals embedded into the sword's guard. \"These gems act as conduits for different spell formations, which in turn can be activated by triggering it using the wielder's mana.\"\n\nGuy furrowed his brows in confusion, and then asked, \"How are they any different from those regular devices with spell formations drawn on them? Like that heating rack for those beakers and test tubes that alchemists use.\"\n\nAl nodded vigorously and answered, \"THAT is why I suggested this as a possible solution for Markus. You see, those inscribed devices are different from these enchanted items because the former requires an active source of mana to run, such as the mage using it or maybe from mana crystals. If the mage cannot supply sufficient mana to the device, it won't run. But the enchanted weapons are independent of the mage. The gems can naturally absorb mana from the environment and use it to power the spells inscribed in them.\"\n\nGuy's mouth opened wide in amazement. \"So you're saying that if we inscribe the spells into the mana gems and embed them into a weapon, then Markus can cast those spells even if he cannot, by himself, cast those spells?!\"\n\nAl smiled widely and affirmed, \"While what you said is heavily simplified, that is the gist of it. After all, there are a lot of nuances to enchantment apart from just inscribing the spell into a gem.\"\n\n\"True... True... True...\" Guy muttered in a low voice as his mind began processing the new information.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-034]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":186,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 032 - Enchanting","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nGuy stared incredulously at the mountain of items on Al's desk. The sight reminded him of the loot-splosion at the end of a casual RPG he played back on Earth.\n\n\"What are these?\" Guy asked as he leaned sideways to face Al.\n\n\"They're enchanted weapons and armours,\" Al said matter-of-factly. With a proud smug he observed Guy's reaction. He wanted to see the shock and awe on his face. But contrary to his expectations, all Al got was a confused and awkward look of... contempt?\n\n'What the hell?!' Al exclaimed. He did a double-take of the stack on his desk to make sure that he had retrieved the right items.\n\n'They're enchanted weapons, all right!' That wasn't the issue. Then what? Why wasn't Guy fawning over them like he was supposed to?\n\nWith a hesitating tone, Al probed, \"What's wrong?\"\n\nGuy's lips tilted in confusion as he replied, \"Nothing. It's just... why are they so resplendent?\"\n\nIn fact, resplendent was an understatement! As a rich, second-generation scion of a prominent family, Guy's tastes were extremely refined. He had the opportunity to come into contact with the most splendid of items in his old world and had learned to appreciate their aesthetics properly.\n\nThe weapons splayed before him threatened to rot his cultivated sense of aesthetics. Each and every single item was crowded with multiple gems of varying colours. He separated a sword from the stack and saw that its guard was lined with 10 equally sized gems of non-uniform tones. It was less metal and more mineral at this point!\n\n'Did they just dip the sword in glue and throw gems at it to see what stuck?' At least with this sword, the gems weren't scattered haphazardly. The armours, shields and the other weapons in the stack were much worse.\n\n'Why are there gems embedded at the armour's chest?' The sight burned Guy's eyes. He was reminded of the iconic armour from an old movie about a famous comic book superhero back on Earth.\n\nGuy handled the items on the stack by pinching them between his fingers. For an observer, it looked as if he was handling a filthy or tainted object. Ironically, Guy had actually handled filthier things when he worked to build a proper sewage system in a country he visited in his past life. He was much more comfortable clearing garbage stuck in jammed up gutters as opposed to these gem-clogged monstrosities.\n\nIt was an unconscious reaction of Guy's, but it had unwittingly offended Al. He had forged and enchanted every single item on the stack after all. \n\n\"How are they decadent?\" Al challenged while suppressing his anger.\n\n\"Oh? I mean... look at all these gems. They completely detract from the beautiful craftsmanship of these weapons and armours. Look here, these gems are placed exactly where the wearer's nipples would be! Oh, and look at this armour set. Why are the gems all lined around the groin? And why do all these weapons have gems placed tightly near the region where the wielder holds them? It has poor ergonomics.\"\n\nUpon hearing Guy's explanation, Al's irritation was sufficiently quenched. He was delighted to hear Guy's appreciation for the exquisiteness of his handiwork. Then what about Guy's qualms on the gems? That was a forgivable offence. The man was ignorant of how enchanting worked after all.\n\n'Once he gains a better understanding of enchanting and its intricacies, he'll be able to better appreciate my work,' Al said to soothe himself.\n\n\"This! This is just... amazing!\" Guy exclaimed as he handled a two-handed broadsword. The weapon was simple in design but was alluring nonetheless. There were no gems or over-the-top additions that offended the eyes. The blade had a symmetric shape, yet it didn't look artificial as if a machine had forged it. Guy just knew that a craftsman had lovingly hammered this blade into its current shape. The metal itself had a mystical design that resembled the replica of Damascus steel weapons from Earth. The sword guard was simple, yet practical. When being wielded, it didn't interfere with the holder's grip and flowed perfectly as they shifted between stances. The handle itself was meticulously wrapped with soft leather, sensually revealing sections of the treated wood underneath. The pommel matched the design on the blade's metal as if the entire sword was a single seamless piece from tip to peen.\n\nBut this was just the start, what really stood out was the intricate engravings that snaked along the spine of the sword. They had a gemlike sheen that stood out from the fluid metal design. Although Guy couldn't decipher the meaning of those engravings, he could somehow make out a story as his eyes flowed over them.\n\nHe let himself indulge in that feeling and was shown intermittent flashes, or scenes, of a figure wielding the two-handed sword and rampaging through a dark forest filled with intricate webs. The figure was drenched in green blood as arachnid appendages flew haphazardly with every slice. It was a gruesome, yet enthralling visual.\n\n\"How beautiful!\" Guy said as he carefully handled the sword.\n\nThe corners of Al's lips twitched. 'How did that get in there?'\n\nBefore Al could clarify, Guy exclaimed, \"Now this is what I'd call exquisite! Whoever made this was a genuine craftsman. All of those,\" Guy said as he jerked his head across the mountain of items on Al's desk, \"They're amateur work! Obviously whoever made those was all flash and no substance.\"\n\n\"*cough* I made all of those,\" Al muttered embarrassedly.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Guy asked while craning his neck.\n\n\"I made all of these enchanted items. The one you're holding - I won that in an auction,\" Al confessed.\n\nGuy froze in place like a deer caught in headlights. At that moment, his mind replayed the events that had transpired during the past few minutes.\n\n'Ha...' Guy sighed. 'Back when I asked for a face-slapping experience of my own, I never expected it to bite me in the ass.'\n\n\"Hey, Al. I was just... I didn't mean anything by what I said before. I don't even know anything about enchanting. Just think of it as the ramblings of an ignorant person,\" Guy quickly uttered as he tried to smooth things out.\n\nAl sighed loudly and chuckled bitterly.\n\n\"Actually, I also agree with you,\" Al said as he picked up one of the enchanted swords from his pile.\n\nHe then continued, \"The field of enchanting has regressed ever since the Age of Isolation, which happened 5000 years ago. What you hold in your hands right now is the result of Dwarven enchanting. As for this,\" he said while gesturing at the weapon in his hand and the mountain of items on his desk, \"is as close as we can ever get. In fact, calling it enchanting is a mockery of the word itself.\"\n\nGuy's eyebrows rose in surprise, \"I don't understand.\"\n\nAl nodded in understanding and said, \"It's better if I show you.\"\n\nAl conjured up a multitude of spell circles and channelled his mana into them. Immediately, the space around Guy warped. As his surroundings stabilised, he found himself standing in an open area similar to the academy's practicing fields.\n\n\"Watch carefully,\" Al said as he stood in front of Guy, while he held the gem embedded sword in his hand. He walked up to a practising dummy and brought the sword down with a seamless slash. The gems embedded in the sword's guard illuminated and bright lines like circuitry extended across the sword's blade. While the blade worked through the dummy it shredded the material, as if countless tiny blades of wind were whirring around the metal. Once the sword exited the dummy, it cleft it perfectly into two halves.\n\n\"And now, watch this,\" Al then said as he extended his hand towards Guy. The sword in Guy's hand propelled itself into Al's open hand as if it were magnetised. Al centred himself once again and performed a similar sword slash on another dummy. This time, while the blade descended, the intricate engravings along the spine illuminated with a soft sheen. As the blade contacted the dummy, it started to shred the material in a more gruesome manner. Unlike with the other sword, this one extended well beyond the immediate vicinity of the blade and Guy could see that the damage even propagated further into the dummy perpendicular to the sword's trajectory. After the cleft dummy fell, Guy saw just how devastating the slash was. He definitely didn't want to be on the receiving end of the strike.\n\nAl held onto the blade in his hand and released a long sigh filled with envy, sadness, and defeat.\n\nHe then spoke solemnly, \"What you saw before, was the result of my attempt to replicate the enchantment of this sword. It was the culmination of over two decades of research and development. In the end, I barely managed to scratch the surface.\"\n\nGuy gasped as he heard Al's declaration. Since he had yet to see anyone stronger and more capable than Al, Guy had subconsciously placed him on a pedestal. To hear that there was something Al couldn't accomplish even after sacrificing 20 years, was akin to blasphemy of the highest order in Guy's point of view. It was just like when an older sibling admitted that they didn't know something.\n\nGuy eyed the Dwarven sword in Al's hand in awe.\n\nNoticing Guy's incredulous gaze Al chuckled, \"What if I told you that this sword was only a Common enchanted weapon amongst Dwarves?\"\n\nGuy's eyes nearly burst out of their sockets at that revelation.\n\n\"You're saying there are enchanted weapons stronger than this?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-033]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":187,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 031 - Lowering the Skill Floor","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nAl leaned forward in his seat and paid close attention to Guy's request. After hearing Guy's confession, Al had upgraded their relationship from acquaintances to friends. And as friends, exchanging favours was an obligation. Besides, Guy had done him a huge one by allowing him access to his inheritance. Al feared he would never be able to pay that back in his lifetime.\n\n\"The new spellmaking method seems to work well for Markus. However, recently I found that there were still some spells that are exceeding his capacity. After testing them out, I found that he couldn't cast spells which conjured projectiles or acted at a range beyond his mana domain,\" Guy explained.\n\nAl nodded and offered his opinion, \"That makes sense. Propelling a spell beyond the mana domain, and maintaining its integrity, consumes more mana. I know that only Late stage Mana Condensation realm mages can cast spells like |Fireball|, |Water Ball| and so on. Most spells accessible to Middle and Early stage Mana Condensation mages act solely within their mana domains.\"\n\n\"But that's natural, why is it a problem?\" Al then followed up.\n\nGuy smiled wryly in response, \"I was just wondering. Since we managed to lower the casting requirement for most spells, shouldn't it also be possible to allow Early and Middle stage Mana Condensation mages to cast ranged spells?\"\n\nAl laughed heartily at that thought, \"Now that's just being greedy, isn't it?\"\n\nGuy shook his head, \"Being inquisitive isn't being greedy.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you on that point. But that aside, why are you bothering over it anyways. Markus will most definitely advance in his cultivation as long as he practices those spells you gave him,\" Al replied.\n\n\"I know that it is an eventuality. However, by my estimation, he would be cutting it real close. He will most probably advance right before the tournament, and that is only if he practices diligently without pause. I don't think it healthy for him to do that,\" Guy pointed out.\n\nAl sighed loudly. It wasn't that he was unaware of that fact. He had also run the numbers and had arrived at the same conclusion. It was just that he didn't want to be the one to point it out and burst Guy's bubble. No one wants to be a killjoy.\n\n\"What I find surprising is that no one has even considered researching this till date. I mean you've lived for over 100 years, have you never thought about all of this?\" Guy asked.\n\n\"It's not that no one hasn't explored this avenue, but rather that they don't find it necessary. If you think about it, all magic research is geared towards raising the skill ceiling. 'How can you make this spell more devastating? How can you increase the potency of this potion? How can you amplify the destructive properties of this weapon?' - those are the question most often explored by mages,\" Al clarified.\n\n\"Wouldn't that alienate the mages at the lower rungs of the ladder looking to enter the circle?\"\n\nAl nodded and summed up, \"I guess so. I think the prevailing ideology is that magic is supposed to be difficult, otherwise just about anyone can become a mage. If we lower the skill floor, then the world will be inundated with half-baked mages incapable of handling their power. Imagine the devastation that might cause.\"\n\nGuy could understand this perspective. It actually reminded him of an ongoing debate in one of the more developed nations in his old world. The right to bear arms. It was a hot topic, which was under the spotlight for decades.\n\nThe right was a remnant from a time when law enforcement was flimsy and less reliable. The people who devised it wanted to provide citizens with the ability to protect themselves. However, with the progress of time, it became evident that it was no longer necessary. Why would someone need to own weapons to protect themselves if law enforcement was commonplace and more robust?\n\nGuy for one was strongly against the ownership of firearms. His opinion was built on the carnage wrought by them on the sacred grounds of knowledge - the schools. Children shouldn't have to worry about losing their lives in a place where they are supposed to explore themselves.\n\nHowever, the people for the ownership of firearms used this as an excuse to proliferate it further. \"This is a perfect example of why more people should own weapons!\" They would claim. \"Throw a weapon into the arms of the teachers!\" They'd then add.\n\nThey intended to lower the bar required for a person to purchase and own firearms. This would ultimately result in what Al claimed earlier - unfettered destruction and collateral damage caused by irresponsible people wielding power beyond their means.\n\nHowever, Guy could not view the scenario in this world with his tinted lens from Earth. This world was brutal and unforgiving. Law enforcement existed here but only in name. Power reigned supreme, and laws could bend to accommodate it.\n\nSo while Guy would agree with Al's perspective if he was back on Earth, he couldn't readily comply with it now. And so, suppressing his discomfort, he parroted a line he'd heard often from the group strongly for the right to own firearms on Earth.\n\n\"While I agree with your point, I think the issue is evident in the last part of your reasoning. Half-baked mages WILL wreak havoc if they are given power beyond their level. However, if they are properly trained and educated, they can be more responsible. In fact, you are overlooking the damage caused by strong mages that let their power go to their heads and run amok. Couldn't you also argue that the unfettered advancement of destructive and large-scale magic can cause greater damage?\"\n\nAl nodded in affirmation and muttered in a low voice, \"I should know, better than anyone, the carnage an irresponsible and powerful mage can unleash...\"\n\nGuy couldn't hear Al's comment and so he continued by adding, \"Ultimately, my concern is tied intimately with my student's wellbeing. I am just shocked that no one else has ever considered cases such like this before.\" \n\n\"That's because, for most teachers, it is easier to raise a mage that shows higher potential for magic than one with a low affinity to it. The former requires fewer resources and is guaranteed to reach greater heights. After all, the success of a student reflects positively on the teacher's capabilities.\"\n\nGuy shook his head and retorted, \"I don't think that's right! A teacher shouldn't get to choose their student, just like how a parent doesn't get to choose their children or vice versa. On that note, why are the people here calling themselves teachers anyways? If anything, they're more like glorified talent scouts! They overlook the large portion of the incoming students in favour of the smaller fraction that portray above average skills and push them ahead. They essentially don't have to do any work, it's just laziness! \nAnd what's more? Those lucky few that move ahead grow arrogant over the fact that they are superior to the less fortunate ones. They don't understand the importance of the power that flows through them and abuse it as they grow stronger. Only those without power, who have to work hard and struggle to gain it, can understand its true value.\"\n\nAl smiled bitterly as he heard Guy's impassioned speech. He was amongst the rare few in this world that could agree with every point Guy made. He had experienced the worst that the existing framework could birth. He was ashamed to admit that he was also one of those \"glorified talent scouts\" during his early years. Ziva Lune, his first and last student, was a cut above all others in his batch. Al had to fight tooth and nail against other teachers to pull the kid under him. He felt such pride as he watched the kid advance in his cultivation. But Al had overlooked Ziva's arrogance and strong bloodlust. Al blamed himself for how things turned out. But who could say whether things would have turned out differently if another teacher had taken in Ziva instead?\n\nThe establishment itself birthed Ziva, and Al knew it, but it would be callous to write it off as such. He was also a part of that establishment! It was only through a harrowing experience that Al realised his folly. And since he couldn't do anything about it, Al decided to take the cowardly route and separate himself from the establishment altogether.\n\n\"This is exactly why I appreciate you, Guy,\" Al said as he sighed. In actuality, he aspired to be more like Guy. The man had no power, but had gone beyond his limits to support a kid - that many \"teachers\" would have written off as worthless - and succeeded! Guy didn't fret over the unwritten rules enforced by the establishment and chose to follow his own path. To Al, Guy embodied the essence of teaching in its purest form.\n\nAl clapped his hands with determination and said excitedly, \"I think I might have a solution to this problem. You're looking for a way for a mage to cast spells beyond their level, right?\"\n\nHe then pulled out his storage disk and channelled mana into it.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-032]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":188,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 030 - Passionate Confession","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\"Actually... I've been lying to you, Mr. Jeeves,\" Guy started, causing Al to shift uncomfortably in his seat. He already knew it, but hearing it out loud still left a bitter taste in his mouth.\n\nAfter a deep exhale, Guy continued, \"I didn't read any books written by a long-forgotten race. But please don't misunderstand. I didn't lie because I wanted to deceive you in any way. It's just that... I was deeply ashamed.\"\n\nAs he finished the sentence, the expression on his face drooped significantly. Al, who was paying close attention to Guy's facial queues for any specific tells, was surprised to notice genuine sorrow in Guy's eyes.\n\n\"You see, back when the academy implemented the new rules regarding teaching apprentices and the tournament, I was devastated. I knew that I wouldn't amount to much in this life, and the stringent requirements imposed in this new format would mean that there would be a high chance of me losing all possibility of ever becoming a teacher in this lifetime.\"\n\nGuy shrugged as he added, \"I only wanted a stable job. Something that could support me until my death. I never had any expectations of becoming successful or revered in this world. And that was why I had gambled everything on this venture.\"\n\n\"Because of that, on the day I learned of the changes... I attempted suicide,\" Guy declared as he hung his head in shame.\n\nThis revelation registered an involuntary gasp from Al. Evidently, this discussion was going in a completely different direction from what he had expected. He never thought that a happy-go-lucky person such as Guy was at the end of his ropes. He never showed any obvious signs.\n\nGuy didn't bother with the audience's reaction, and continued, \"The day I solidified that decision, I tied a rope around my neck and hanged myself.\"\n\n\"But then, at the moment when the last ounce of breath left my lungs, I saw something-\" Guy suddenly ramped up his explanation. Involuntarily, his voice morphed into his teaching voice and his body animated with heightened fervour. Unable to contain himself, Guy stood up from his seat and waved his hand while continuing, \"I saw a vision! A world similar to ours, but different in many ways! A world void of mana and magic. A world ruled by a dominant species known as the Homo Sapiens.\"\n\nAs he turned towards Al, Guy exhorted, \"Everything else I told you was the truth! I was provided with a large influx of knowledge, of various things from that world. Much of it felt foreign to me, but at the same time, it made sense! It was nearing the end of this revelation that I saw the essence of this different world, The True World!\"\n\nGuy spread his arms wide and orated unimpededly, \"I knew that this was a sign! The revelation and the information it provided was too specific to be otherwise. And so, I fought against my impending doom and saved myself. But afterwards, I was sceptical. I didn't know if what I saw was the truth or whether it was simply a figment of my imagination - a fantasy stitched up by my mind starved of oxygen.\"\n\nGuy closed his hands and extended his index finger while pulling Al's undivided attention, \"However! The moment I succeeded in creating that modular spell, I knew! I just knew that it was all real!\"\n\nGuy then paused. He wanted to catch his breath and let the outburst of information ferment in Al's mind.\n\nAs he sat down, he continued in a hushed tone, \"When you asked me about how I learned all of this, I was apprehensive. I was ashamed to admit the grave decision I made at a moment of weakness. I didn't want you to see me as a weak-willed coward. And for that, I apologise profusely!\"\n\nAl absorbed the information as it left Guy's mouth, and slowly calmed his tightened nerves. For one thing, he was glad to see that there wasn't a hint of misrepresentation. So he was assured that everything that was just spoken was the truth.\n\nHowever, the issue was never whether Guy was being truthful or not. Al was more concerned about the source of the knowledge. People that have lived for a long time have naturally learned to be more sceptical about things they see and observe. Experience through age played a huge role in this.\n\nMost beings forget to question the source, credibility and danger associated with the knowledge that comes their way. Maybe it is the result of the underlying philosophy to grow stronger regardless of the method that prevails in this world. This was something his previous student fell victim to, and because of that Al was especially perceptive of such matters.\n\nThe moment Al heard Guy's complete confession, he was completely relieved. Why? That was because Al was familiar with the kinds of visions Guy was alluding to. Not that he had ever experienced it himself, but Al had read of and heard of similar experiences through his travels and interactions with various mage powerhouses.\n\nWhat Guy described strongly alluded to an event when a mage activates and internalises an inheritance!\n\nAn inheritance, when it comes to cultivation and magehood, mainly refers to the consolidation of a mage's entire cultivation and will which exists in transferable form. A mage can \"inherit\" another's cultivation through many forms. The easiest, and crudest, is to internalise a mage's core which forms once they break through into the Core Formation realm. It is a construct that forms once a mage advances and \"solidifies\" their cultivation. After death, this core quickly dissipates, however, another mage can absorb this and make it their own.\n\nWhile this method is easy, it is inefficient and possibly dangerous. The mage can very easily deviate their own cultivation by absorbing another mage's raw will, or core, especially if the incoming cultivation is incompatible or conflicting with their own. Furthermore, the mage will have to actively absorb and decipher the insights from the core, otherwise, it cannot be internalised. This effectively means that a large portion of the core can be lost in the process.\n\nThis, however, is not the only way for a mage to gain an inheritance. A more efficient, albeit difficult, process is to gain it through an inheritance artefact. These are physical manifestations of a mage's cultivation that are formed willingly by a mage that enters the Ascension realm. These artefacts may be in the form of weapons, armours, trinkets, or in many cases a portal into another dimensional realm. Al knew of this solely through infrequent chatter and obscure letters. Information on inheritance artefacts is closely guarded by large organisations, or lucky individuals, to not attract attention from unwelcome parties.\n\nThe reason inheritance artefacts are more efficient is because the cultivation and will stored in them are immutable and eternal. Once transferred, the artefact does not become inert. Furthermore, the transference is not a massive information dump. Instead, the artefact either instils the information in a steady and manageable stream or waits for the inheritor to achieve an activation condition.\n\nWith regards to these inheritances. Al had heard of and read of many different explanations. For some, it is as if insights simply manifest inside their minds. Almost as if they were a forgotten memory that was recollected all at once. For others, it is as if the inheritor is shown a long and extremely immersive vision spanning multiple lifetimes, condensed into an infinitesimal time frame. Some records state that these visions are manifestations of the original mage's own experiences, successes and failures. In other cases, these visions are more obscure or cryptic, displaying farfetched or unbelievable concepts. While this may sound convoluted, this method may actually make it easier for the inheritor to internalise the transferred cultivation and will.\n\nAnd so, Al likened the almost nonsensical vision that Guy experienced to a revelation provided by an ascended mage's inheritance. The cultivation may have been too obscure or out of this world which warranted a vision of that form. Evidently, it helped as Guy was able to grasp a large influx of information very easily. Al figured that Guy may have once in his lifetime come into contact with an inheritance artefact that imprinted this information inside him. When Guy entered a limbo state between life and death, it must have met an activation condition for transference!\n\nThus, Al was satisfied. In fact, he was even a little honoured and moved to receive a glimpse into another mage's inheritance. These things were supposed to be secrets that mages took to their graves, or passed down to people closest to them. Al was a little conflicted because he felt as if there was a huge debt weighing down on him. Inadvertently, Guy had just gained a very powerful backer.\n\nAs these thoughts were running through Al's head, he had entered a dormant-like state. Guy observed that Al was in deep contemplation, and was satisfied to know that his explanation was observed positively.\n\nGuy's unadulterated confession was filled with passion. No research or facts was supporting it. So Guy was a little worried that there might have been some loopholes or inconsistencies. Well, Guy had overlooked the convincing powers of a feverous missionary. Some dudes in his old world even managed to convince thousands of people that their souls would be consumed by aliens after death!\n\nAlthough, that one may have an inkling of truth to it...\n\nIn the end, while he submitted to the impulses provided by this soul partition, Guy's supreme rationality was blaring vehemently. Seeing as this mask was no longer necessary, Guy quickly regressed into his RoK, no... The Church.\n\nOnce he entered, he beheld the very unfamiliar endless hall from his raised dais. Guy suppressed his growing urge to preach unintelligible drivel to the nonexistent congregation and pulled off his mask.\n\nThe moment the object lifted off his skin, his sights morphed drastically.\n\nAs he came to, he found himself back in the familiar centre of the RoK. Guy sighed in relief and carefully placed the mark in his hands on the table next to him.\n\nHe stared at it with conflicted emotions. He wanted nothing more than to get rid of this portal, which was akin to a dark and corrupted hole into madness, but he couldn't bring himself to do it.\n\nA part of himself was attached to this mask, and he knew subconsciously that it would be impossible to get rid of it.\n\n(We'll need to experiment with that. I think the reason for this soul partition has a lot to do with the RoK,) Mast spoke up from over Guy's shoulder.\n\nGuy's head darted around and landed on Mast's figure walking towards the shelves of the RoK.\n\nAs Guy lowered his gaze he saw the books in Mast's hand.\n\n\"What are you doing with those?\" Guy interrogated while rushing towards Mast.\n\n(I'm putting them in the -) but before he could finish, Guy quickly grabbed the stack and threw them with gusto.\n\n(What are you doing?) Mast asked in confusion.\n\n\"Those books will NOT be placed in this library! I refuse! Burn them for all I care!\" Guy declared righteously.\n\n(But you just threw them deeper into the RoK...) Mast grumbled as he strode over to fetch the books.\n\nGuy harrumphed and resolutely shook his head. He had already bent his morals to read through that... literature. He was now suffering the consequences of it. He was NOT going to taint his beautiful haven of knowledge with them!\n\nWith a flourish Guy exited the RoK, leaving Mast to clean up the mess.\n\nOnce he returned to reality, he saw the Al had digested everything.\n\n\"Actually, Mr. Jeeves. I came here today to ask you for a favour,\" Guy asked.\n\nAl was no longer apprehensive about associating himself with Guy. He was a bit more enthusiastic, and so, he acquiesced readily, \"Sure! As long as it is within my power.\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-031]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":189,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 029 - of Lizard People, Aliens, Doomsday, and Whatnot","n":0.316},"1":{"v":"\nGuy was stuck in a bind. In an attempt to allay suspicion he had inadvertently created a lie, which had now pushed him into a self-dug hole. And now, he was forced to crawl out of it.\n\nBut how? He couldn't tell anyone the truth about his transmigration.\n\nIf he couldn't claw out of the hole, the only option left was to dig deeper. So deep that it would be practically impossible to see the light from above. And that was what he was about to do.\n\nHowever, this begged the question of how? Guy wasn't a confidence artist in his past life to be able to weave such intricate lies that would entrap even the most vigilant of people. But that didn't mean he couldn't learn from them.\n\nHe was an educator first. And as an educator, he must have the capacity to adapt and update his own repertoire to best enlighten the youths.\n\nThankfully, the RoK provided him with the perfect learning environment, and Mast provided him with an excellent set of references to sharpen his skills in deception, misrepresentation and falsification.\n\nThis did not mean that Guy was comfortable with the whole deal. He was wholly against such acts from the very core of his being. However, when faced with lying on one end and eternal cessation on the other end of the balance, as a human being with an inbuilt urge to survive, he gravitated towards the former.\n\nAs he leafed through the pages of the books provided by Mast, albeit with visible uneasiness, another change transpired in his budding foundation.\n\nJust like how a parent works to mould their children's morals and character, a cultivation method works to do the same for a mage. It is a type of indoctrination that a mage does to themselves that later blooms to cement their being, both externally and internally.\n\nThe values inculcated through cultivation are harder to change in later realms, but since Guy was still in the Mana Condensation realm it was easier to mould.\n\nInitially, he had a foundation that mimicked a spark - a nascent flame. If he had cultivated the Way of the Burning Fist to breakthrough, this foundation would have burgeoned into a turbulent sea of flames. It was a common starting point for most fire element-centric mages.\n\nHowever, his initial resolve to actively disinvolve himself in the lives of people in this world was ideologically different to his old foundation. And so the shift, while drastic, was manageable and didn't result in any negative feedback.\n\nHis most recent resolve to adorn a mask of deception to align himself to the people around him was also a momentous decision that would stay with him for the rest of his life here. Thankfully, it meshed perfectly with his already passive credo and as a result, it also caused a positive change in his foundation.\n\nIt should be noted that it wasn't so easy for mages to undergo such magical shifts in ideology by just reading random books. The content must evoke a certain shift so profound that it creates some form of appreciable change in the mage's psyche. The shifts within Guy should be wholly attributed to the \"deep\" contents of the books he was reading.\n\nYet this change in Guy was not apparent at first glance. After all, the foundation hadn't been formed yet. What would later grow to resemble a body of water was just a measly puddle. Still, if anyone were to approach this puddle of transparent and clear water, they wouldn't see the water bed, but rather a reflection of themselves that presented them in a form they yearned for subconsciously. The tranquil puddle was a mirror that reflected the perfect reality everyone wanted to see.\n\nRight after Guy finished absorbing the contents of the books before him, his mind ran on overdrive and built an elaborate web free of holes. As the metaphorical web materialised, a mask formed in his RoK that manifested the reality weaved in this web.\n\nThe mask was void black with white spots floating in it forming unintelligible shapes. It was like an inverted Rorschach test. As he lifted the mask, he asked, \"What is this?\"\n\n(Apparently, your actions have resulted in a philosophical shift within you. It has affected your cultivation, but surprisingly it has also left a mark on your soul. This mask in front of you is the remnant of that mark,) Mast replied with a hint of confusion in his tone.\n\n\"Will this affect me in any way?\" Guy probed with visible concern. His soul was what bound him to his life in this world. He couldn't afford to damage it in any way.\n\n(It doesn't seem so. It appears as if you've created a partition in your soul. That mask works like a gateway for you to access that other partition.)\n\n\"All of this sounds so precarious. Are you sure that it's safe for me to use?\"\n\n(I blame mana,) Mast sighed. (Stuff like this never happened in my world. There was a clear boundary that the sentient beings in my world couldn't cross. But mana just screws everything up!)\n\nGuy stared at the mask as he debated on whether he should adorn it or not. He didn't know what it did. But just the presence of an unknown object in his RoK was bugging him.\n\nGritting his teeth, Guy brought the mask closer to his face. Right as the cold and steely material contacted the skin on his face, Guy started to experience a shift in his psyche that spread out from a deep corner.\n\nWhile it was hard to describe, Guy could feel a creeping shadow work its way through, suppressing certain thoughts and magnifying others. In some cases, it even flipped some of his notions on their head. As he was tempted to contend on some matters, and fiercely debate on others, the shadow quickly quelled those urges. Surprisingly, he started to agree with them vehemently, to an almost zealous degree.\n\nThe shadow quickly enveloped everything, leaving a mass of supreme rationality intact in a corner of his mind. It was strong enough to get out of his now trance-like state, and quite possibly suppress it for a set period of time if necessary. Guy was thankful for that. He was extremely uncomfortable and disgusted by his current beliefs.\n\nWhen Guy pulled his attention out from his psyche, he saw that he was no longer in the RoK. Or maybe he was. Maybe this was the RoK that corresponded to this partition of his soul.\n\nHe was standing on top of a dais. Behind him, the wall was pearly white, emanating a conflicting sense of approachability and foreboding. Right at the centre was a massive symbol formed of a stark black metal. It wasn't a static symbol, as the structure morphed intermittently.\n\nA trio of interlocked triangles. A swirl. A pentagram. The eye of the Illuminati. An ankh. The Ouroborous. The deathly hallows?\n\nGuy quickly averted his gaze from the alluring symbol and turned forward.\n\nLike the RoK, this place extended to infinity but with a caveat. While in both situations there was an origin, the RoK extended in all 360 degrees, this place extended monodirectionally starting from the dais he was on.\n\nOn the dais, there was a podium similar to the ones found in churches. It too shifted periodically, with its themes alternating between a myriad of flavours. To his right was a large altar. Its design would match that of the podium and the implied flavour from the symbol hanging behind him.\n\nFrom the dais, extending forward, were rows of benches all facing towards him.\n\n\"This place...\" Guy muttered.\n\n(Looks like a church,) Mast interjected.\n\n\"The Church...\" Guy parroted.\n\nGuy approached the shifting podium and inspected its designs. As his fingers contacted its surface, a series of visuals flashed before his eyes.\n\nHe saw the Earth getting warmer, and people stripping off their skins to reveal their reptilian selves. He saw a horde of UFOs approaching the planet and abducting groups of peoples. He saw the Earth's crust cracking resulting in an age of disasters of apocalyptic proportions.\n\nAs he was getting absorbed into the various \"revelations\" presented by the podium, his rational self took over and pulled him out.\n\nSweating due to a mix of excitement and fear, Guy snarled at Mast, \"You did this to me!\"\n\nMast raised his hands to feign acquittal and replied, (Hey man... How would I know that you'd get so absorbed?)\n\nGuy slowly unfurled his shaking fists and exhaled to calm himself down. \"What exactly is this place?\"\n\n(Hmm... I can't say for sure. It feels exactly like the RoK. It's another space built within your consciousness except that it is tied to your soul partition,) Mast hummed in contemplation.\n\nGuy's eyes widened as he replied, \"Wait a minute! Did I make my own system? I can't believe it! I had the power inside me all along!\"\n\nMast face-palmed. (By your definition, it appears to be something like it. But unlike the RoK, its functionalities aren't known to me. I guess we'll have to figure things out as we go along.)\n\nGuy shuddered with a devious chuckle as he surveyed the room.\n\n\"Let's call this place... The Church!\" He declared piously.\n\nFollowing that, he clapped his hands and commented resolutely, \"Well, let's get this over with then!\"\n\nAnd with that, Guy pulled his consciousness out of The Church. As he returned to his body, he saw Al looking at him with a concerned expression.\n\nIt was then that Guy realised that he had been sitting in place blankly for over half an hour.\n\nGuy quickly centred himself and began.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-030]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":190,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 028 - House of Cards","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nGuy knocked on Al's office door and waited for permission. He was a little apprehensive about approaching Al. Based on his observation, Al seemed like he was averse to teaching people. The last time a kid asked Al for clarification regarding a section in a spellbook, he just waved his hand and tossed the kid out of the library.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nHearing the affirmation, Guy entered. But right when he stepped into Al's office, he was assaulted by a horrific sight that caused his stomach to churn.\n\nThere were papers strewn left and right! There were plates of half-eaten food peppered around the room. The man's desk was piled with stacks of open books, documents, artefacts, and gadgets. The room smelled rank as if it hadn't been aerated in centuries.\n\nIn his lifetime, Guy had seen many workaholics and their \"lairs\". But this was by far the worst of its kind. It was as if all of them had been condensed into one space and then multiplied by a 100.\n\nThere was barely enough space to step foot inside the room. Guy wondered how Al managed to transit from the door to his desk.\n\n'Does he hover?'\n\nAl peeked from around the mountain of papers on his desk and saw Guy's aghast expression. He then followed Guy's gaze and inhaled the sight before him. It was at that moment, he realised the absolute mess he had created.\n\nBiting his tongue, Al quickly waved his hands and materialised multiple spell circles. As they vibrated and expanded, the items in the room started to levitate and move.\n\nThe leftover food in the room disintegrated. The papers fluttered together and stacked themselves automatically as if given lives of their own. The books on his desk lifted themselves and marched into the many shelves in his office. A vacuum formed in mid-air and started to vigorously pull at the air particles in the office, taking away the stagnant smells lingering in the room. A series of flashes of light strobed, adding vibrancy to the drab and peeling walls with each passing.\n\nAs Guy beheld the sight before him, he sighed inwardly at the conveniences offered by magic. He was especially envious of the vacuum air freshening spell.\n\n'I guess that's one good reason for me to advance my cultivation.'\n\nWhile Guy could create a vacuum using his modular spells, it wasn't like this one. Guy could clearly see with an |Inspect| cast that Al was essentially puncturing a hole in space and pulling in the particles through it. It was like how the vacuums from Earth worked, where they created low pressure by running a high-speed fan. But instead of having a dust bag, the filth was deposited into a different space altogether.\n\n\"Please take a seat,\" Al said, pulling Guy out of his trance. Al gestured Guy towards a chair that magically materialised before his desk. Well, it was already there. It was just buried under a massive pile of papers.\n\nAs Guy sat down, Al gushed out excitedly, \"This book you gave me is fascinating,\" while sliding forward a workbook named, \"Elementary Geometry.\"\n\nAdhering to Al's request, Guy would frequently compile information from the textbooks in his RoK and print out concise workbooks for Al to follow.\n\n\"I was especially surprised by this theory by Pythagoras. You won't believe how much time it saved me in verifying the building blueprints a friend of mine was working on. And these theories on shape construction were a massive help in a beast-suppression ritual formation I was working on.\"\n\nAl put away the book and commented, \"You know, at first I was thinking: What's the point of all of this? But then after I thought about it, I found a lot of scenarios where some of the concepts and theories here could prove of use.\"\n\n\"That's what they all say,\" Guy muttered while stifling a chuckle.\n\nAl then snapped his fingers as he remembered something, \"Oh right! I was thinking about the whole True World Theory you brought up last time. I looked into it, but I couldn't find any information about it. I am quite interested in learning more about the theory in general.\"\n\nAs he finished the sentence, his gaze sharpened. Guy knew immediately that this segue was a probe.\n\nGuy started to panic. He had been too quick to write off Al's scepticism. The man had lived for over a century, after all, it couldn't have been so easy to hoodwink him.\n\n'Mast! Help me!' Guy pleaded.\n\n(What do you want me to do?) Mast replied in confusion.\n\nGuy screamed in defeat. He didn't know what to do! He had made up the whole True World Theory to create a reliable fallback for the ideas he was producing. If anyone asked how he envisioned something, he could attribute it to the works of a forgotten race with a rich history.\n\nBut he never thought that Al would actually grasp so tightly at those strings and follow them so doggedly.\n\n'Why are you so inquisitive?' Guy lamented. Ironically, being a teacher, this was something he should be encouraging from his students.\n\n(Why don't you just play it off? I looked up information on how people responded when place in a situation similar to yours. Usually, they plead ignorance,) Mast offered.\n\nSeeing as there wasn't anything else he could do, Guy decided to roll with that.\n\n\"Uhm... I don't know why you couldn't find anything about them. Then again, the merchant told me that people didn't really believe the things written in the books. They thought it was just some nonsensical fiction,\" he said while shuffling uncomfortably in his seat.\n\nAl leaned forward and hummed, \"Probably... But this is what I don't get. Even if it was perceived as fiction, at least someone should have tried things out. The experiments were so detailed, it would be weird if some people didn't make an attempt. And on top of that, if the books written by a foreign species made it into our plane, that must mean there was a realm connection between our plane and theirs. So by deduction, there has to be more evidence of their presence. I have a lot of connections who manage research into foreign races and magic, and none of them have ever heard of Homo Sapiens before.\"\n\nGuy stared at Al with a blank expression. While he appeared calm on the surface, he was freaking out internally. Thankfully the RoK existed and Guy could conveniently escape into it at any time.\n\nStraddling his knees, Guy rocked in place.\n\n\"Mast! What do I do? Can't I just tell him I'm from another world?\"\n\nGuy was not comfortable with lying. In his past life, he had spent a great part of it discouraging kids from being deceitful. He was already queasy about the whole Homo Sapiens and True World Theory spiel he made up to avert Markus' and Al's curiosity. And now, he was facing the consequences!\n\nHe always believed that lying was akin to building a house of cards. No, not the show, the metaphor. Even a casual investigation could threaten to topple the entire structure.\n\nMast materialised next to him and immediately shook his head, (No can do. My brother is keeping a part of his attention on you at all times. If he hears you reveal that you were brought here from another world, then I am screwed.)\n\nGuy then jolted up and screamed in aggravation, \"Then give me a solution, damn it!\"\n\nMast bit his lips and dissipated, leaving Guy by himself. Guy returned into a fetal position and rocked in place. Following a quick minute, Mast returned with a stack of books in his hand.\n\n(So I processed our predicament and cross-referenced it with historic scenarios from my world. You're basically struggling with keeping up an elaborate lie, right? Well, I think these could be of help,) Mast said while extending the stack to Guy with an eager and pleased expression.\n\n\"What are those?\" Guy asked. As his eyes scanned over the titles of the books in the stack, they widened in disbelief.\n\n\"You're kidding,\" he commented while shaking his head in incredulity.\n\n(No. I really think these will be useful for your cause,) Mast replied while pushing the books towards Guy.\n\nGuy leapt back from Mast's extended hands as if avoiding the plague.\n\n\"I refuse to even entertain this thought!\" Guy stipulated while closing his arms.\n\nMast shrugged and retorted, (Well, do as you wish. But just so you know, if you disclose the fact that you've been transplanted into this world, I will delete you.)\n\nAfter throwing a casual threat Mast disappeared, leaving the stack of books on the table in the middle of the RoK.\n\nGuy debated internally for a while as he approached and moved away from the books. He never would have thought that he would have to consult from books like these in his entire life.\n\nSwallowing his shame, Guy inched closer and cracked open the book at the top of the pile. Suppressing his urge to hurl, he started reading it.\n\nWhile this entire back-and-forth was occurring in the RoK, due to the lack of time dilation, in reality, Guy was basically sitting in place the entire time with a blank expression.\n\nAl observed Guy with extreme scrutiny. Truthfully, he wasn't planning to grill Guy like this. He was satisfied with Guy's explanation of the source of the knowledge.\n\nBut as he got to know Guy, he started to appreciate him as a person. He wanted to form a closer relationship with Guy; something more along the lines of friends. Al had already run a background check on Guy. He confirmed that Guy was truly an orphan and was not affiliated with any parties at all.\n\nThe only issue was that there weren't any records of Guy before he arrived in Radiant City. So there was no way for Al to verify the claims regarding the foreign species and novel theories.\n\nWhile Al could take Guy for his word, he was averse from doing so. His experience with a strayed student had taught him better than to trust people readily.\n\nAlthough Al was interested in the almost revolutionary theories proposed by Guy, he wanted to fully confirm its source. He had heard of far too many cases where mages were led astray due to tainted knowledge, resulting in cultivation deviation or worse.\n\nAl liked Guy a lot. He was a good teacher and a nice kid. If he didn't care about him, he wouldn't have egged Guy this way. If Guy refused to reveal his source, then Al would summarily cut their relationship and treat it as a passing acquaintance.\n\nTherefore, Al was carefully taking note of the changes in Guy's expression the entire time. In the beginning, when Al began his casual interrogation, he had noticed a growing uneasiness in Guy. This spelt trouble!\n\nEither the man was willfully being duplicitous, or he was unknowingly ignorant. While it was alright in both cases, the reason mattered to Al.\n\nAl was fine with Guy not revealing everything to him. But then he wanted to confirm the cause for withholding the information.\n\nBut surprisingly, Guy quickly calmed down and entered a blank trance-like state. Al kept his eyes peeled for any deviations, however, the man had turned into a statue.\n\nAfter half an hour of inaction, Al became concerned and leaned forward to nudge Guy.\n\nBut right before his fingers could make contact, Guy's eyes turned resolute and his face animated in fanaticism.\n\nAs Al once again evaluated Guy's expressions he noticed something awkward. There was a trace of disgust in Guy's resolute expression. It could have been easily missed by anyone but since Al was paying particular attention, he grasped on to it very quickly.\n\nTo Al, the resolute expression conveyed that Guy was about to reveal a truth he had suppressed deeply. While the hint of disgust indicated that Guy was not proud of it.\n\nAl's eyebrows furrowed as he wore a frown.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-029]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":191,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 027 - Cultivation of Self","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nAs Guy walked towards Al Jeeves' office in the library, he started to look back on the events since his transmigration.\n\nGuy's previous experience during the check-in session with his supervisor gave him a rude awakening on just how weak he was in this world.\n\nSubconsciously, Guy was subscribed to the modern belief that knowledge and wealth equated to power. But it was only after seeing how Jo Way snatched the resources his student deserved through brute force, that Guy realised that in this world power equated to power.\n\nEven the smartest and the wealthiest individuals in this world were beholden to the fists of a bull-headed yet strong pauper.\n\nAnd so, Guy started to spend his free time trying to advance his cultivation realm. He had been stuck in the Late stage of Mana Condensation for quite some time now, and he understood that it would be damaging to his image as a teacher to remain there. \n\nHis main motivator was the fact that he was now a master to Markus. As his disciple, Guy was a pseudo-parent. Well, since Markus was an orphan, Guy could actually be considered a full parent. Therefore as a parent, he was responsible for the well-being of his ward. And to have a better lifestyle in this world, strength was a prerequisite.\n\nGuy wasn't disillusioned by the fact that he was a transmigrator. He knew that he didn't have any inherent advantages compared to the folk native to this world. Maybe his aberrant thoughts and knowledge could give him an edge. After all, he managed to rebuild spellmaking using modern concepts. \n\nBut when faced with a nuclear warhead, a superior writing utensil would be useless.\n\nGuy had already resigned himself to grabbing Al Jeeves' thigh. But he recognised that it wasn't a sustainable solution. For one thing, Guy knew that their relationship was built on the sole fact that Al was gaining something beneficial as well. While the scales remained balanced, Al would be willing to put his name on the line to protect Guy. But the moment Guy became more trouble than what the benefits were worth, he would be tapping into the goodwill he had inculcated in his relationship with Al to protect himself. At that moment, when the scales tilted unfavourably, Guy knew that Al would drop him without hesitation.\n\nTo an extent, it was unfair to Al as well. The man had held out a rope by virtue of their friendship. It would be selfish for Guy to exploit that.\n\nSo with this in mind, Guy tried his hardest to push his cultivation forward and breakthrough into Foundation Establishment. But he quickly realised that his past experiences and education, which he thought were things that gave him a slight advantage in this world, were actually holding him back.\n\nHe found out that his mind was unable to comprehend and resonate with the mantras and insights inscribed in the Common cultivation methods of this world. It wasn't that they were exceedingly complicated for him to understand them, but rather that they were too abstract and nonsensical.\n\nThe way the cultivation methods approached certain phenomenon was too medieval and contested with his own preconceived notions on the matter.\n\nTake his current cultivation method for example. The Way of the Burning Fist was a fairly common cultivation method amongst mages. It was basic enough to be accessible and was open-ended enough to be built upon with more Advanced methods from specialised sects or organisations.\n\nThe goal of the cultivation method was to mould the mage's mind into subconsciously tapping into the fire element in the environment, and infusing it naturally into their mana. The various mantras pulled the mage into a trance where they would observe the naturally occurring fire element in mana and slowly isolating it, circulating it, condensing it, and absorbing it.\n\nThis begged the question: what is a fire element?\n\nBack in 1789, Antoine Lavoisier defined his first periodic table in which he included an element called Caloric, or heat. He defined heat as a fluid based on the fact that it had similar properties such as moving from a region of high concentration to regions of low concentration. \n\nWas that the fire element? Maybe it was. Back then, scientists didn't have sufficient insight into the nature of elements and matter to know that heat was not an element but rather a form of energy.\n\nSo, was the fire element described in these cultivation methods referring to the heat energy in the environment? Such as infrared radiation, the kinetic energy of particles, and potential energy in intermolecular bonds?\n\nMaybe it was. But how was Guy supposed to visualise them? Energy by nature was an abstract concept. He could visualise the radiation as waves. But how? Maybe he could refer to how infrared emissions were displayed in heat maps that used visible colours to define the intensity. However, this was also a method used by humans to comprehend abstract idea. It was not an accurate representation.\n\nAlternatively, he could identify the energy as waves. Which brought him back to the question, how? How do you visualise waves that don't require a medium to travel through? At least with conduction and convection, the transfer was through particulate vibrations. But that was only a small part of the wide, and abstract, concept of heat and, by extension, the fire element.\n\nWhile all these methods were plausible in assisting Guy in cultivating the Way of the Burning Fist, they didn't resonate with him. Deep down, Guy knew that these images were only half-baked and couldn't stand by themselves. He knew that even after he built his foundation and broke into Foundation Establishment, he couldn't move further as his base was unstable.\n\nFor a cultivation method to resonate with an individual, they must be able to comprehend it and internalise it perfectly. There must be no unsurety or apprehension. If the mage had a shadow in their subconscious that fought with their understanding of the mantras in the cultivation method, they would never be able to advance. And if they managed to advance forcefully, they would face catastrophic backlash in the future.\n\nHaving an unshakable will was the only way for mages to advance their cultivation and grow stronger.\n\nThis was a luxury out of Guy's reach. He was a foreign man in a foreign world, without any foundation. He didn't have a crutch to fall back on like most people in his position, such as a hidden family with deep roots, or an immortal grandpa with heavenly knowledge, or even a system that gave him some random boosts once in a while.\n\nAnother reason for Guy's lack of success in cultivation was because every time he sat down to cultivate, his mind would deviate and he would end up contemplating random thoughts.\n\nFor instance, was he unfulfilled in his last life?\n\nHe was! He never married, nor did he have any emotional connections with people apart from his family members. While he was psychologically and physically fulfilled, Guy was emotionally repressed most of his life.\n\nEven after being thrown into this world, Guy was quick to adapt to the unfamiliar scenario. Why wasn't he overwhelmed? Of course, he was! He was on the verge of crapping himself the moment the gravity of the situation dawned upon him.\n\nBut he quickly reverted to an easygoing frame of mind. It was because he was equally emotionally repressed for most of his life.\n\nObserving the unfairness of the world, and the squalor that a large portion of the innocent population of his old world was subjected to had warped his frame of mind. He recognised that he was born with immense privilege, unattainable to most others even through hard work.\n\nHe subjected himself to intense scrutiny and drilled the thought that his happiness was undeserved. He never had to work hard to get the things he wanted, while the kids he taught had to work themselves to the bone for it.\n\nEven after he was given a second chance in life in this world, Guy quickly went back to his old frame of mind and started to sacrifice himself for the benefit of a pitiful kid. Even Jo Way, the brute who called himself a teacher, was collected enough to work towards his own happiness. Right now, that man was raking in money by selling a myriad of potions using his cheat.\n\n\"Why couldn't I do the same thing?\" Guy would ask himself.\n\nAnd it was because of these introspective excursions that Guy unwittingly reduced his cultivation time. Guy had lied when he said that he handed so many minute variations of a basic spell to Markus to test him in thinking critically. In truth, Guy was just afraid of settling his mind through meditation.\n\nSo ultimately, Guy concluded that this second life of his was inconsequential.\n\nHis first life, at least the first 25 years of it, was fulfilling enough. His lack of an emotional connection was his own choice and he should be able to accept the consequences of it. And while he was struck with a battery of illnesses in the final leg of his life, it wasn't as bad as what most others in the world were subjected to. If anyone did deserve another chance it would be them.\n\nTherefore, Guy decided to ride the wave with his second chance. He would tackle things as they came. However, he kept in mind that he was an anomaly in this world. A dead man walking while the others were alive and were living their first and last life. And so, he wasn't going to hinder the course of others for his own benefit.\n\nThe moment Guy solidified this thought, a profound yet subtle change transpired within him. His budding foundation, which was a residual from the cultivation of the deceased Guy Larks, dissipated and another one slowly formed in its place.\n\nA mage's foundation was generally in the form of a body of fluidic mana. The base nature of the body was a good indication of the cultivation method employed by the mage. While before, Guy's foundation held a faint appearance of heat and burning, this new one was tranquil and serene.\n\nIf one equated the foundation to a body of water, this new one was as if the water body was so unperturbed and clear that a casual viewer couldn't make out whether there was water in it in the first place.\n\nSince Guy was still in the Mana Condensation realm, he couldn't register this change. He casually shrugged off the sudden discomfort as a side-effect of his rather heavy and oily breakfast and knocked on Al's door.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-028]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":192,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 026 - Inductive Fallacy","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nModern scientific inquiry is based on two schools of logic: deductive and inductive reasoning. Nearly all theories and models developed through the scientific process are based on these two lines of inquiry.\n\nTo define them using a simple analogy, consider a pyramid.\n\nDeductive reasoning can be equated to a person moving from the bottom of the pyramid to its tip. It is commonly observed in mathematics and other systems built on axioms. The goal is to determine the nature of a specific case given a general conclusion.\n\nFor example, let us consider a situation where we want to determine whether a horse is a mammal. We start with a general statement that can properly describe a mammal, such as its ability to give birth to live young. We then observe that a horse can birth live foals. Therefore by comparison we can conclude that a horse is a mammal.\n\nWhile this method is straightforward and effective, there are some glaring faults that can topple the integrity of the process. First off, deductive reasoning relies on a robust general conclusion. Without the major premise, it is impossible to draw a comparison with the specific case.\n\nSecondly, if the major premise used as the basis of comparison is not properly defined, then we experience something known as a deductive fallacy. Reconsidering the above horse example, while the fact that \"all mammals give birth to live young\" is true, it is not holistic. For instance, platypus and echidnas are mammals that lay eggs. Evidently, these are isolated cases, but the fact remains that unless defined during the deductive process, we open ourselves to a false conclusion. Because of that, there needs to be greater rigour when picking a general conclusion prior to deductive reasoning.\n\nHowever, in nearly all other cases, scientists resolve to use inductive reasoning. This is akin to starting from the top of the pyramid and moving downwards. We begin with a specific case and work towards building a general conclusion through controlled experimentation and surveys.\n\nWhile this process is more measured and rigorous, it is prone to a common logical fallacy known as the inductive fallacy. In simple terms, it states that to disprove a general conclusion, all it takes is a single exception to the statement. For example, the statement that \"all swans are white\" can be easily disproven by finding a single black swan.\n\nAnd this problem needs to be considered when drawing sweeping conclusions through inductive reasoning.\n\nAs a teacher, Guy was intimate with these fallacies and always made it a point to enlighten his students - in a way that was easy to comprehend - to be aware of them in their daily lives. His goal was to not just inculcate knowledge in his students but to impress upon them the skills and tools needed to become effective learners. This was so that when they step foot into the jungle-like modern world, they would be more independent in advancing themselves, and would be more critical in absorbing information from different sources.\n\nIronically, Guy himself fell into the trap of forming a false generalisation based on insufficient evidence. When he first developed this new modular spellmaking method, he found that Markus was able to cast them without a hitch. And so, Guy figured that as long as the spells pertained to the basic elements, Markus would be able to cast all of them similarly.\n\nThe mistake he made was that he didn't test his hypothesis with all the variations of spells that could be developed using this spellmaking method. As a result, there was a subset of spells that were beyond Markus' reach.\n\nTherefore, after having a filling lunch, Guy sat down in the library and approached the issue with a fresh frame of mind.\n\nFollowing inductive reasoning, Guy had to determine the cause of the exception. To do this, he needed to first find out the commonality between the spells. If he could define the similarity, then he could work towards alleviating the problem.\n\nAs he stared at the spells constructs in the sheets before him, he started to note down the characteristics that could be gleaned through a cursory glance. It was likely that the answer was staring him right in the face, just that he was too involved to notice it.\n\nGuy realised that element-wise, the spells were diverse. There was an equal mix from each basic element that Guy had set out to cover. After eliminating the element of the spell as the cause of the problem, Guy went a level deeper and evaluated the number of modular components composing the spell.\n\nHe couldn't find a pattern there either. Some spells were concise and contained up to four components, while others were more intricate with around eight or ten components. However, in the process of investigating this avenue, Guy realised that although he built the new method on the concepts of programming, the former was much smarter as it performed a lot of garbage collection automatically.\n\nUsually in programming, when feeding a variable into a function, unless specified, the program copies the variable and runs the function on that copy. This can very quickly lead to the system running out of memory. The modular spell, however, does not create unnecessary copies and is smarter about how it handles variables fed from Source Components.\n\nBut Guy didn't go further along this path and shelved it for later because it was a segue from his current predicament.\n\nAfter testing out other hypotheses, Guy quickly realised that the issue might not be in the technicalities of the spell, or the way it was put together.\n\nTaking a different approach, Guy started to physically cast the spells in an open field outside the library.\n\nAfter cementing an efficient method to develop spells modularly, Guy had kind of gone off the rails and put together a ton of spells, most of which were similar in nature, but were sufficiently distinct to be considered novel.\n\nFor instance, he took the |Fire Ball| spell and starting to play around with the Action Components to change its shape, developing the |Fire Torus|, |Flame Disk|, |Fire Arrow| and so on. Although they had a different visual, 90% of the components used in the spell were the exact same. He only fiddled with the components that defined the shape of the spell.\n\nWith that, he started to cast each spell sequentially. \n\nThe first spell produced a burgeoning fireball in his hand and propelled itself in the direction his palm was facing. The following spells were similar, except it wasn't a fireball anymore and the shape of the flaming projectile varied.\n\nThe second set of spells produced a ball of whirling wind in his palm, which then propelled itself. The following spells were also wind projectiles, except with different shapes.\n\nThe third set was similar, except the element was earth. Since earth was a generally static element, Guy couldn't produce many variations in its offensive spells. However, there were a lot of defensive solutions such as a spell that made a set of levitating condensed earth disk that could intercept opposing projectiles or a spell that formed sharp projectiles out of sand particles that could penetrate through the application of friction.\n\nThe final set comprised of water spells that worked both offensively and defensively such as |Water Jet| or |Water Shackles|.\n\nAs Guy progressed through the stack of spells, he finally figured out the reason why Markus failed to activate these spells.\n\n\"They're all range based!\"\n\nAs defined previously, every mage has a mana domain that demarcates a region of space centred around them, which the mage has full control over. As the mage advances in their cultivation realm, this domain expands proportionally. Since Markus was only at the Early Stage of the Mana Condensation realm, his mana domain was a measly two metres.\n\nAs long as the spell's effect remained within this two metres limit, Markus didn't have to expend excess mana to sustain the spell. But as soon as the spell is required to leave this domain, additional mana is required to maintain the integrity of the spell.\n\nThis additional expenditure follows a square relationship. That is, the amount of mana is proportional to the square of the extra distance beyond the mage's mana domain. This is because the mana domain forms a sphere, whose surface area is a function of the square of its radius. And when the spell exceeds the mana domain, the mage is forced to control the spell by establishing a pseudo mana domain that has a larger radius.\n\nGuy noted that this correction was another one of those automatic fixes implemented to ensure that the spell activated.\n\n'This world seems to provide a lot of assistance to mages in its own way.'\n\nHe figured that given more time, he could optimise the modular spellmaking method, and streamline the mana use so that instead of making a pseudo mana domain that is a complete sphere, it only forms a spherical sector. But considering the time-cost-to-mana-performance relationship, Guy concluded that it would be more efficient to seek out alternate solutions.\n\nUltimately, it was predictable that Markus was unable of activating these ranged spells because he was physically incapable of doing so.\n\nSo Guy was now faced with a new problem, and that was to determine a solution to facilitate these ranged spells without the need for expending an astronomical amount of mana. To do this, he decided to seek assistance from a veritable information powerhouse, Al Jeeves.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-027]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":193,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 025 - Critical Thinking","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nThere were many practising fields distributed across Radiant Academy's campus. They were generally quite wide and could accommodate multiple students at a time.\n\nMost students would spend the majority of their free time at the practising fields to brush up on their martial arts or spellcasting.\n\nThe fields were built specifically to be highly resilient to damage, and they also had multiple wide-scale ritual formations to aid in that endeavour.\n\nFor instance, one of the most common ritual formations embedded into the practising fields could distribute any concentrated source of damage across the entire field's surface. By doing so, it reduced the amount of destruction caused by potent offensive spells.\n\nIt was also not uncommon for students to cultivate in the practising fields. However, this was mostly undertaken by students whose cultivation methods were especially volatile and were prone to damaging the environments they cultivated in.\n\nOne student, for example, had a cultivation method that was geared towards explosion. Essentially, the method converted the student's blood into a potent primer. The student's mana is converted into an activator which, once infused into the blood, initiated a brilliant explosion. While the student cultivated, they would constantly exude contaminated blood from their pores. This would inevitably get infused with the mana the body released during cultivation. Because of that, the student was forced to cultivate in such reinforced spaces like the practising field.\n\nFor others though, a place that was constantly filled with a cacophony of different spells exploding, training dummies shattering, and adolescent boys and girls grunting was not typically conducive to cultivation. So it was natural for the students that were present to throw awkward gazes towards the corner of the field where a student was seated in the lotus position, surrounded by a stack of books.\n\nMany were tempted to go there and ask the boy why he was reading books here of all places when there was a less noisy library readily available in the academy's campus? But they scrubbed that thought. They were here to practise, not waste time.\n\nHowever, Markus was here at the field for an important reason. For the past few days, Master Larks had been handing him different spells that were within Markus' capacity. Most of them were similar in nature and were derived from a base spell. In the end, the sheer quantity of those spells exceeded Markus' expectations.\n\nWhile he was excited at first, Markus quickly realised one key problem. He had to memorise all the spell constructs so that he could cast them at a moment's notice. He didn't have the luxury to pull out the sheet displaying the spell construct in the middle of a confrontation.\n\nAnd so Markus decided to squat at the practising field with all the spells his master developed for him and cycled through a set every day until he internalised them properly.\n\nUnfortunately, the memorising marathon had been interfering with his other studies. Especially the additional work Master Larks provided in the form of a workbook. He had managed to complete one or two experiments and read through one theoretical section in the book. But for the past few days, his progress had stagnated.\n\nMarkus stored a stack of spells into the folder marked \"Memorised\" and pulled out the next stack to start memorising.\n\nHis process was simple. Each spell on the stack had a specific name or identification assigned to it. Some spells were similar and so their names would also include a descriptor that differentiated them from the others. Markus would first flip through the stack in hand and examine each spell carefully. He would keep his eye out for specific features in the constructs that differentiated them.\n\nHe would then cover the spell construct, revealing only the name and descriptor. He would go through the stack again, but this time he would try to recollect the spell construct just based on the name and descriptor and see if he could cast it successfully. If he failed to do so, he would remove that particular spell from the stack and move on.\n\nAfter an initial run-through, he would revisit the stack that was removed after the first run and repeat the same procedure until all the spells were memorised.\n\nOnce he finished, he would test the entire stack once again to make sure that they were internalised properly before moving the spells into the \"Memorised\" folder.\n\nIt was a time consuming and arduous process, but Markus figured there wasn't an alternate strategy. This was how everyone was taught from the beginning.\n\nBasically, a mage's basic training revolved around three things: cultivation, spell casting, and martial arts. These three were linked together with the cultivation method at the centre.\n\nThe cultivation method was an indicator of what types of spells and martial art were compatible with the mage. Obviously, it wouldn't make sense for a mage with a fire-type cultivation method to learn water-type spells. Similarly, water-type mages would be attuned to martial arts that had a fluid nature.\n\nThese factors made it so that the mage didn't have to memorise a bunch of irrelevant spells. They would only keep the spells pertinent to their cultivation, and ones that would complement their martial arts.\n\nMarkus was in an unfortunate and special situation where he didn't have a cultivation method or martial art. Therefore, he was forced to memorise a plethora of spells that spanned all the elements classified as basic such as fire, water, earth, and air.\n\nJust as Markus started going through the new stack, a familiar voice interrupted him. \n\n\"Markus! You're still here? It's time for lunch,\" Guy exclaimed as he made his way towards Markus' corner.\n\nMarkus scratched his forehead as he smiled wryly, \"I guess I lost track of time...\"\n\nGuy shook his head in defeat as he instructed, \"Nourishment is important for an active mind. You're only holding yourself back by doing this.\"\n\nMarkus nodded his head vigorously and started to arrange the sheets and books before him.\n\nAs Markus was floundering to retrieve some of the papers that were out of his immediate reach, Guy observed the mess before him.\n\nFurrowing his brows, Guy asked, \"What are you doing here anyway?\"\n\n\"I'm memorising the spells, Master.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Guy asked in a stern voice.\n\nNoticing the shift in his master's tone, Markus answered carefully, \"So that I can cast them without having to refer to the sheet with the spell construct.\"\n\nGuy shook his head and clarified his point, \"You don't need to memorise them. You're only wasting your time by doing it this way.\"\n\n\"I don't?\" Markus exclaimed in shock. \"But then what about all of these sheets,\" he continued while raising a massive stack in his hand.\n\nGuy chuckled, \"I was only showing you some examples. Do you still have the workbook I gave you last time?\"\n\nMarkus nodded and pulled out the workbook from his backpack.\n\nGuy shuffled through the pages and commented, \"You've only finished these many chapters?\"\n\nMarkus lowered his head and said, \"I'm sorry, Master. I couldn't manage my time properly.\"\n\nGuy waved his hand and pointed at a page in the book, \"Look here.\"\n\nHe continued, \"You finished the experiment on understanding combustion, but you didn't look through the entire chapter.\"\n\n\"Do you remember the first spell I showed you? The one that used coal to ignite a fire in your hand?\" Guy asked.\n\nMarkus nodded and retrieved that spell from his backpack.\n\nGuy placed the sheet next to the workbook and turned the page. In this section, Guy had included a copy of the spell construct which was broken down, with explanations supporting the different sections of the spell.\n\n\"The spells I gave you are all modular. They are different from the ones in the library, in that you have more control over what you want them to do. Take this fire spell, for example, there are a few key components in the spell that determine its function.\"\n\nGuy pointed at the decomposed spell and said, \"This is a Source Component that pulls in the oxygen from the environment. As you already know from the experiment, oxygen is necessary to sustain the combustion reaction. This Source Component derives the carbon from the coal to act as fuel. You can see here that these Action Components act according to what you learned from the experiment, to sustain the fire.\"\n\nGuy reached into Markus' memorised folder and retrieved a few fire-type spells. He laid them on the floor and continued his explanation, \"The reason I gave you these spells was to show you how you can use the information from the experiments and theoretical chapters, as well as the relevant components described in the sections after, to put together your own spell to fit your need.  \nYou must have already noticed that most of these spells are similar. That's because I am modifying, adding, or removing some components from the spell.\"\n\nMarkus nodded as he digested all this information, \"I have disappointed you, Master. I was too hasty...\"\n\n\"It's mainly my fault. I am used to teaching in one particular way and failed to consider your approach to learning. As a teacher, it is my responsibility to tailor my teaching style to suit the student, not the other way around.  \nBut I do want to point out, that if you had taken the time to read through the workbook, you would have figured out my purpose much earlier.\"\n\nGuy then tapped Markus' nose and chuckled, \"To be successful, you need to work smarter, and not work harder. It is very easy to develop tunnel vision when working on a problem singlemindedly. To avoid that, you must always consider all the resources available to you and derive smarter solutions.\"\n\nMarkus nodded his head resolutely, \"I will keep that in mind from now on, Master.\"\n\nHe then resumed packing up all of his things. But halfway, he paused, as he remembered something.\n\n\"Oh, right! Master,\" he called out, \"I was so immersed in memorising the spells that I forgot to inform you-\"\n\nHe then dug through his folder and retrieved a few sheets.\n\nHanding them to Guy, Markus stated, \"I can't cast these spells. I can form these constructs, but I can't activate them by channelling my mana.\"\n\nGuy's forehead wrinkled as he perused through the spells. He was confident that the spells were functional as he had tried them before handing them to Markus.\n\nWith a confused frown, he muttered, \"What's wrong now?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-026]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":194,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 024 - (Interlude) Meeting an Old Friend","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nKaist Maika tapped his fingers on his office desk as he read through the form in his hand. Even though he was over 100 years old, his appearance evoked a youthfulness of a middle-aged man. If not for his eyes that betrayed the inevitable vicissitudes of life, one could easily mistake him for a 30-year-old.\n\nHe wore a clean suit bearing the academy's colours, with some extra regalia indicating his position as the headmaster.\n\nJust yesterday he received a notice from the academy's administrative department that a teacher filed a form requesting a transfer of a teaching apprentice.\n\nUsually, such requests involved the acknowledgement of the teacher under whom the apprentice was currently working and the teacher under who the apprentice was set to be transferred.\n\nThe issue here was that the form was submitted with only the signature of the latter, and just the name and information of the former. Such one-sided and blatant requests were usually shredded at the end of the week, but this one was special.\n\nThe guys at the admin department were stumped because the teacher who submitted the form was Al Jeeves.\n\nKaist sympathised with them. In the past few years, he had also started to regret seeking out the man and convincing him, through an extremely laborious process, to join his Radiant Academy.\n\nAlthough Radiant City was one of the most well-known cities in the Solar Empire, Radiant Academy was only a second-tier academy within the empire. This was primarily because the highest level of teaching certification held by any teacher in the school was 3-stars.\n\nSo it was a little counterproductive to seek out a teacher who only held a 1-star license to boost the school's prestige. But the fact was that although Al was only a 1-star teacher, his capacity was far beyond that. \n\nEven Kaist, who held a 3-star license, had to display his deference in front of Al.\n\nUnfortunately, even though Kaist convinced Al to join the Radiant Academy 50 years ago, it appeared as if it was only in name. Al refused to involve himself in matters such as apprenticeship and tutoring. The man basically shut himself in the academy library and refused to entertain anyone.\n\nBut this didn't stop Kaist from shamelessly plugging in Al's name when wealthy families surveyed academies for their children.\n\n\"Our academy is also home to the renowned Teacher Jeeves,\" he'd tell them.\n\nWhen they'd ask if it was possible to put in a good word for their children with Al, to which he'd say, \"Well... I can't promise anything. He's very strict when it comes to choosing personal students.\"\n\nThe parents usually mistook that for a hint that some monetary lubrication would be needed to grease the metaphorical wheels.\n\nThey'd then offer some \"donations\", which of course Kaist would reject once. But after a few volleys of half-hearted pushing and pulling, he'd \"reluctantly\" accept the amount while assuring that he would, \"try my best to put your children's names at the top of the list when Al considers taking in some personal students.\"\n\nHe didn't lie. He would always mail in a list of names every year to Al. What Al chose to do with that list? Not his problem.\n\nSo it was a pleasant surprise when the apprentice transfer form with Al's name printed on it popped up in the admin department. Luckily, the guys working there had the presence of mind to contact him instead of disposing of it.\n\nAs Kaist read through the form, he took note of the apprentice listed for the transferal.\n\n\"Guy Larks,\" he muttered as he dug through his memories for any information related to that name.\n\nAs a mage in the Core Condensation realm, his mental faculties were far beyond the limits of mortal men. So it came as a surprise when Kaist failed to recollect anything about this man.\n\nAs he scratched his forehead to dig out any information, a series of equally spaced out knocks interrupted him.\n\nKaist sat up straight in his seat and waved his hand. The air pressure in the room shifted slightly causing the door to open slowly.\n\n\"You called for me?\" Al asked as he walked into the room calmly.\n\nKaist wore an amicable smile and gestured Al to take a seat. \"It's getting harder to get you out of the library, old friend.\"\n\n\"Nothing interesting happens nowadays that necessitates it. Besides, it's more fun to live amongst books,\" he replied mirthfully.\n\nThe two then descended into friendly banter as they exchanged new tidbits.\n\n\"... so I told him, 'I don't think those are vines...' But he didn't listen. He walked up and poked the tips hanging off the ceiling. And guess what?\"\n\nAl leaned in in anticipation.\n\n\"The 'vines' instantly fired through his nostrils and slithered down his backside. Before he could flush his system, they hardened and broke off,\" Kaist chuckled.\n\nAl subconsciously clenched his anal sphincters.\n\nKaist quickly waved his hand and assuaged Al, \"Relax, it didn't hurt. We did some research and found out that these, let's call them Mimic Vines, constantly seek the quickest way into the soil. Unlike regular plants, they germinate in extremely dry and nutrient-less locations. As they grow, they creep towards nutrient sources in order to sustain themselves. Considering this peculiarity, they're extremely rare and only grow in highly specific environments.\"\n\nAl nodded in understanding and quickly fired off a few questions related to these new plants.\n\nAs Kaist answered them methodically he chuckled inwardly, 'Still as inquisitive as always.'\n\nOnce the discussion reached a standstill, Kaist decided to carefully probe Al regarding the transferal form.\n\n\"So enough about me. What I really called you here for was to ask you about this,\" he said while sliding the form across his desk.\n\nAl glanced at the form blankly and answered, \"It's an apprentice transferal form.\"\n\nKaist snorted and commented sarcastically, \"Really? I did not know that.\"\n\nHe then shook his head and rephrased his question, \"It's been 50 years since you joined this academy, and not once have you actively involved yourself in its matters. I consider you a friend and an invaluable source of credible advertising, so I didn't bother you about it. But now I see that you're taking on an apprentice, and that too some random bloke called Guy Larks.\"\n\n\"And?\" Al urged impatiently.\n\nKaist choked on his words, \"And? What gives? Why now? And why him? If you want I can suggest a few promising teachers or apprentices with good aptitudes.\"\n\nAl quickly shook his head and interrupted Kaist, \"I'm not doing this because I want to train a teacher. Why would I take on an apprentice willingly? I already told you that I'm not planning to ever teach another person in my lifetime.\"\n\nAs he finished that sentence, the expression on Al's face dropped.\n\nKaist furrowed his brows in sympathy, \"I heard that Ziva has started his own sect deep within the Blackstar Kingdom.\"\n\nAl nodded in affirmation, \"I know...\"\n\nThe person of interest, Ziva Lune, was Al's first and last student. The boy displayed a high affinity for magic and managed to achieve his 1-star teaching license at the age of 18.\n\nKaist remembered the immense pride with which Al used to tote his student's accomplishments.\n\nBut as the saying went, \"tall trees fall the hardest\". Who knew whether it was because he advanced in realms too quickly, or if he grew too arrogant, but the boy started to display unfettered sociopathic tendencies, stopping at nothing to advance his strength.\n\nBy perverting techniques Al himself created, the boy developed his own techniques to unleash a potent plague that wiped out the population of an entire city in less than a week. The worst part was that the plague lingered and could sustain itself indefinitely. It also wrought a drought so vile that it turned the land into an expanse incapable of supporting any form of life.\n\nTo date, none could formulate a countermeasure to the disease. Essentially turning a strategic portion of the Solar Empire into an uninhabitable no man's land.\n\nIt was then that Al slowly retreated into a shell and obsessively seeked new knowledge. For others, this looked like a consequence of Al's cultivation method, but that was only a half-truth. Al's cultivation method did require him to accumulate new or unheard-of knowledge, but it wasn't to a level that he had to seclude himself.\n\nKaist knew that Al, rightfully, held himself responsible for the calamity his student wrought into this world. He knew that Al was constantly searching for a way to counter the plague.\n\n\"So then why are you taking on an apprentice now?\" Kaist voiced his concern.\n\nAl's seriousness dissipated as he chuckled, \"I'm doing it because the boy needs resources for his student.\"\n\nKaist stared at Al with a stumped expression, \"That's it? He asked you to take him on because he lacked resources?\"\n\nAl nodded, \"His previous supervisor hoarded everything and refused to give it to his student. Saying that there would be no point and that the student was a waste anyway. But the boy was unconvinced, so I decided that I could register for him. It's a win-win situation if you ask me. He gets his resources, you can finally advertise that I took someone under me. I know that there have been complaints that I'm just here in name.\"\n\nKaist's forehead crumpled, \"What's the real reason?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\nAl sighed, \"I might have finally found a way to tackle the plague. And I think this boy has the solution.\"\n\nKaist's eyes widened. He quickly shuffled in his seat as he sat up straight. \"What?\"\n\nBut Al quickly gestured to Kaist to calm down, \"Relax! I don't need you to do anything to him, or for him. This is my responsibility. I just need you to approve this request,\" Al said while pointing at the form.\n\nWithout hesitation, Kaist took another look at the transfer request.\n\n\"Blevin Hinds? Wasn't he the teacher who crapped himself in a spar against his apprentice?\" Kaist said while clicking his tongue.\n\nShaking his head he stamped his seal of approval on the form. \"If what you said is true then it would definitely be a waste to keep that boy under Hinds.\"\n\nBlevins, who was currently laying in the infirmary treating his physical injuries and his shattered ego sneezed ominously.\n\n'Is someone talking shit about me?' he surmised as he massaged his buttocks. Apparently, even after entering Foundation Establishment, the anus remained the most vulnerable part of the body.\n\nThe forceful evacuation of his bowel had ended up injuring a lot of the nerve endings located in that region. Resulting in him losing all control of the muscles in and around his anus. \n\nHe gritted his teeth as he swore to the heavens, in a whisper, \"I'll definitely have my revenge, Jo Way! Just you wait... just you wait...\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-025]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":195,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 023 - Ancient Art of Thigh-Grabbing","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nGuy and Markus returned to the library in low spirits.\n\nGuy was distressed over his inadequacy and incapability to support his student. He was also a little jealous of Jo Way and his unfair and cheat-like Omniscient Library. \n\nBased on the discussion that was happening in the crowd during the duel, Guy could glean the reason for Jo's victory. The man struck Blevin's most blatant weakness, the channel convergence point. The mob characters in the crowd were frantically throwing around theories on how Jo was able to discern the location of one of the most closely guarded secrets of a mage.\n\nSome posited that Jo simply got lucky. Others proposed a radical theory that Jo had a magical eye capable of determining the location. But Guy knew the exact reason why, and it made him feel like crap.\n\nGuy was a fervent believer in the idea that knowledge equates to power. And while Guy's own RoK offered a modest assortment of assistance, comparable to the Omniscient Library, it failed in one key aspect and that was in the ability to synthesise the available information and provide solutions.\n\nIf Guy wasn't a transmigrator like Jo, he would have swept this whole scenario under a metaphorical rug and moved on with his life. As the saying went, \"ignorance is bliss\". But Guy didn't have that luxury, he knew exactly why Jo was able to cruise through everything, and he was salty about it. \n\n'You know what, Mast? If Jo just happened to be some kind of a genius, like a regressor or a dude with a secret master, I'd understand. But this Jo is just another idiot who got lucky!'\n\n(You can't really say that he's lucky. He died after all.)\n\n'Still, though! With that library inside his head, he's living life in easy mode. But what about me? Why can't you help a brother out?' Guy pleaded coquettishly.\n\nMast sighed, (You're being hypocritical. If I gave you the same \"cheat\" like Jo, wouldn't it be unfair to everyone else. You already have the advantage of having lived one life.)\n\nGuy immediately adorned a childlike innocence and contested, 'But don't I deserve it? I wasn't born here, and my mentality hasn't adapted to this world's society. Doesn't that justify a boost of some kind?'\n\n(I've already given you enough assistance. In fact, that computer inside the RoK is already pushing it. If I offered any more, then what would be the point of bringing you here?)\n\nGuy mentally tilted his head and asked, 'That's a good point, why DID you bring me here?'\n\n(I told you already that this world is stagnating. There hasn't been a significant advancement in years! That is exactly why I brought you here. I believe that an external perspective can help push this world forward. It just so happens that our goals are similar so I decided to bring you here.)\n\n'Well if you're just trying to help your brother, what's up with all this secrecy?'\n\n(It's an established rule for world builders to not interfere in each other's worlds. The persistence of the world is deeply connected to the survival of the builder after all. My brother is a stickler for rules and doesn't tolerate interference from outside.  \nHe keeps complaining about how slow this world is every time we have a reunion. So I'm just providing some familial assistance.)\n\nThere was a pause as Guy contemplated on this information. Guy was still uncertain about the technicalities regarding these higher beings called world builders. It all felt outside his realm of comprehension, and whenever he asked Mast for clarification he would always skirt around the question. So these intermittent tidbits Mast would voluntarily reveal were extremely valuable for him.\n\n(The main reason I'm not giving you a cheat, like Jo's is because I've found that with sentient beings such as humans, necessity is the mother of creativity. I can tell you this much, the amount of contribution you've made in pushing this world forward already exceeds Jo's. His Omniscient Library only offers solutions that exist and are already established in this world. There is nothing new. And that man is so reliant on it, that he hasn't bothered to exert his own ingenuity for anything.)\n\nGuy sighed and lamented, 'But what about my problem right now? Without some kind of power, how can I fight for my student's rights?'\n\n(Power isn't always physical, have you considered other alternatives?)\n\nJust as Mast finished that last thought, Al returned to the library and walked up to the gloomy teacher and student duo.\n\n\"I heard some gossip back at the teacher's lounge about how some apprentice from your generation wiped the floor with the academy's poster boy. What happened?\" Al rattled out with visible excitement on his face. \n\nOver the past few weeks, Guy found out that although Al was mostly detached from the world, he was extremely perceptive to gossip and rumours. Guy figured it must be a side effect of Al's cultivation method forcing him to seek out information, of any kind, ardently.\n\n\"My colleague, Jo Way, challenged our supervisor, Teacher Hinds, to a duel because the latter was withholding student allocated resources,\" Guy said monotonously.\n\n\"That's admirable. The boy's talented to be able to defeat someone an entire realm ahead of him...\" Al muttered while nodding his head.\n\nHe then shook the thought and asked cheerily, \"Anyways, why the long faces, you two?\"\n\n\"Although Mr. Way defeated Teacher Hinds, he took my allocated resource as well,\" Markus lamented.\n\nAl furrowed his brows and sighed. But then he asked, \"Is that why both of y'all are so distressed? It isn't that big of a deal. I mean, I have an allocated quota as well. If you want I can get some for you.\"\n\nGuy smiled bitterly and thanked Al, \"Thanks, I would really appreciate it. I'm just sad that I wasn't strong enough to fight for my student the same way Jo did.\"\n\nAl patted Guy's shoulder and said, \"That's understandable to feel that way. The student depends on you after all. But there was nothing you could do about it. All you can do is work hard and push yourself forward to avoid these situations again. Besides, strength isn't always about being physically superior -\"\n\nAl grinned and continued, \"- it's about being so high up that other's can't ever look down on you.\"\n\nGuy's eyes widened. He slapped the desk as he suddenly had an epiphany. His eyes darted sideways and locked on to Al's upper thighs.\n\nUnder Guy's predatory gaze, Al cautiously took a few steps back and covered his crotch.\n\n\"Umm... Guy?\" Al asked probingly.\n\n\"How could I forget! The MC slaps face to survive. But what about the regular folk? The ones without those stupid cheats? How could I overlook the most ancient art of survival of the side character?\" Guy muttered inaudibly.\n\n\"Mr. Jeeves, I want to grab you thi-\" Guy coughed and truncated his current line of thought.\n\nHe corrected himself and repeated, \"Mr. Jeeves, can you do me a huge favour? If not for me, then for my student?\"\n\nAl tilted his head, \"What favour?\"\n\n\"I want my student to get his resources. I owe him that much. But I don't think I will be able to score them as long as I am under Teacher Hinds.  \nThat is why I sincerely request for you to take me on as your apprentice.  \nI know that you don't like to get yourself involved in these trivialities. But please, I am just asking you to bear with me until the apprentice's tournament.\"\n\nGuy then bowed profusely to present his sincerity in the matter.\n\nAl nodded in contemplation and then asked, \"A favour implies reciprocation. What can you do for me in return for this favour?\"\n\nGuy bit his lips and sat down, defeated.\n\n\"You're right. I don't have much to offer. Sorry for bringing it up.\"\n\nAl grinned widely and roughly patted Guy's shoulders.\n\n\"I'm kidding! Of course I can take you on as an apprentice. In fact, there is something you can offer me in return. I want you to share everything you know about this True World Theory, just like how you're teaching Markus.\"\n\nGuy thanked Al, but then he followed up in confusion, \"I was already going to share them with you. It isn't something I planned to keep hidden from you anyways.\"\n\nAl quickly corrected Guy, \"You weren't obligated to share it at first. You could have kept it a secret and it would have become a debt I would owe you in the future. After all, for me, new knowledge is crucial for cultivation. But now, I've turned the table and made it so that this knowledge is payment for a debt you owe me. I've robbed you of a favour.\"\n\nGuy shook his head in amusement. He was already gratified that Al was willing to assist him.\n\nGuy realised something. He had been going about things all wrong. He wasn't the typical main character from those transmigration novels he had read before. \n\nFrom the very beginning, Mast had made it clear that Guy was living a second life. To live is to try and fail. If every venture was successful regardless of the effort put in, then what was the point of living?\n\nWithout failure, life is meaningless because you don't learn anything. \n\nWithout failure, life is meaningless because you never mature.\n\nGuy was given a second chance in life. He decided to cherish this opportunity and keep failing.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-024]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":196,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 022 - Wei Zao the OP MC","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nIt was not uncommon in this world for individuals to resolve their differences through combat. With the existence of magic, it was a trivial matter to treat most injuries that would have been fatal back in Guy's old world.\n\nTherefore, within Radiant Academy, there were multiple combat rings distributed across the campus. There just so happened to be one right next to the wing where the teachers' offices were located.\n\nThe news that the academy's poster boy was challenged to a duel was too juicy! A crowd was forming around the duelling ring, filled with people providing pertinent exposition in the form of generic dialogue.\n\n\"What's happening here?\" Mob character A asked.\n\nMob character B, who was already part of the crowd provided a sufficiently descriptive response, \"Jo Way challenged Teacher Hinds to a duel.\"\n\n\"What? Is that braggart crazy?\" Mob character A exclaimed. The situation did not conform to common logic after all.\n\nMob character B realised that this individual was lacking information on the backstory surrounding this confrontation. So being the friendly bystander that he was, he elaborated, \"Apparently Teacher Hinds was holding onto Jo's student's allocated resources. And so Jo challenged Teacher Hinds for it.\"\n\nMob character A finally understood the context and, as a being capable of complex thought, offered his opinion, \"That's admirable but still! How does he expect to win against a Foundation Establishment mage when his realm is only at Late stage Mana Condensation?\"\n\n\"I'm going to tear you apart Jo Way!\" Blevin arrogantly declared. \n\nNoticing how the others were looking at him with a distorted expression, he realised that he came across as a bully who targeted the weak. So he then added on magnanimously, \"As your senior, I will give you a 5 hit head start.\"\n\nThat caused the spectator's expressions to soften.\n\nOn the other side of the ring, Gaige and Mai were trying their hardest to discourage Wei Zao from going through with the duel.\n\n\"Teacher Way, why don't we leave it? I don't need the academy's resources, I can try contacting my family,\" Gaige said while trying to reason with his teacher.\n\n\"I agree with Gaige, Jo. I think you're being really reckless here. I appreciate you standing up for me, but you're just coming across as a brash braggart!\" Mai commented as she tried to suppress her growing discomfort.\n\nIt wasn't that no one had ever stood up or spoken up for her. As a woman with remarkable beauty, it was a common occurrence. But usually, those pursuers would give in if they were forced to confront someone superior. It was a natural reaction and she understood it, but deep down she resented those spineless men who couldn't follow through on their promises.\n\nAnd while she did have some grievance with Wei Zao for his usual braggadocio, the fact that he was willing to put himself in danger's way for her sake raised her opinion of him.\n\n'Even if he loses, I will try and be a little more accomodating with him,' she thought to herself silently.\n\nWei Zao simply patted Gaige's shoulder and said, \"Don't worry! I am not someone who tries to bite off more than he can chew. I wouldn't have proposed this duel if I wasn't confident in my chances of winning.\"\n\nHe then turned to Mai and said, \"And I am not doing this for you. I just don't like it when superiors try to take unwelcome advances on their juniors simply by virtue of their position and power.\"\n\nGaige's eyes widened. Over the past few weeks, he had gotten a new perspective on his teacher and had slowly relinquished his prior opinions that were built on \"false\" rumours.\n\nUnlike what was being disseminated through word of mouth, Gaige saw that his teacher was far more knowledgeable and capable. The efficacy of the specialised cultivation method and the Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion was indicative of that fact. Furthermore, whenever Gaige had troubles in his cultivation or his martial arts, Teacher Way was able to pinpoint the weaknesses and areas for improvement almost instantly.\n\nSo Gaige concluded that there must have been a reason for his teacher to suppress his popularity and build a negative image of himself. Why? That Gaige didn't know. But he fully believed that his teacher, who was all-knowing and capable, definitely had a plan.\n\nMai wanted to take one last shot at reasoning with Wei Zao and so she turned towards Gaige and nudged him.\n\nGaige ignored those signals and resolutely raised his fists in a cheer, \"I believe in you, Teacher!\"\n\nWei Zao smiled and turned to face Blevin who was well prepared at this point.\n\nWei Zao concentrated on his opponent, and instantly a book with Blevin Hinds written on it materialised inside his Omniscient Library.\n\nBlevin noticed that Wei Zao had a dazed expression and smirked inwardly.\n\n'Let's see how far your bragging can take you!' he sneered.\n\n\"Ready when you are!\" He then mocked.\n\nWei Zao ignored those taunting shouts and focused on the information before him.\n\nHonestly, Wei Zao wasn't sure about his chances of victory either. He didn't even have a record on his opponent when he picked this fight. It was just that he was fed up with all the ridicule this body had received.\n\nOver the past few weeks, he had been putting out one fire after another that the original \"Jo Way\" had lit through his unfettered foolhardiness. Blevin just happened to be the last person on his list.\n\nBut the reason Wei Zao was not too worried was that he now had some confidence in the powers of the Omniscient Library. While in the beginning, he had some dislike for the passiveness of the library - especially how it couldn't even offer him any gacha benefits like potions or artefacts - it had proven its mettle time and time again.\n\nOne of its benefits was the ability to pinpoint any mage's channel convergence point. No two mages had similar mana channel distributions. It was a unique characteristic known only to the mages, and possibly their physicians.\n\nAs their name suggested, these points acted as nodes where multiple mana channels converged as one. The quantity of these points in a mage's body was countable in one hand. Moreover, these points were never static and could relocate once the mage breaks through to higher realms.\n\nThe reason for such a level of secrecy concerning a mage's mana channel distribution was due to the existence of these channel convergence points. If an opposing mage were to strike these convergence points and channel their own mana through them, the shellshock could instantly incapacitate the person.\n\nWei Zao read through the entry on Blevin and recognised the location of the convergence point that was easiest to reach, which was conveniently located right above the liver.\n\nWei Zao returned from his daze and lowered his body for stability.\n\nWhen Blevin saw the sudden change in Wei Zao's expression, he started feeling uneasy. While he was confident in his chances of victory before, now he felt a little threatened. When he realised the shift in his own mental state, he gritted his teeth and prepared himself for the upcoming onslaught. He cursed at himself silently for giving Wei Zao that 5 hit head start.\n\nWei Zao didn't waste any time and channelled mana into his appendages. He was going to take full advantage of those 5 hits!\n\nWith a sudden burst, he covered the distance between himself and Blevin, and then he reeled his right arm for an upward jab.\n\nBlevin calculated the trajectory of the punch and curled his left arm for an upward block. As a Foundation Establishment mage, the punch appeared to hurtle towards him only at a brisk pace.\n\nJust as he let down his guard, Wei Zao propelled his left arm for a quick jab right below the liver. Blevin's eyes widened as he saw the fist closing in on him. Although a liver punch wouldn't incapacitate him like a regular person, the problem was that his convergence point happened to fall at a location right where the fist was headed. Usually, he'd be careful in guarding that region. But he became negligent when facing the seemingly weak Wei Zao.\n\nThe jab connected. Blevin hoped that it was just a simple hit, but to his horror, he felt Wei Zao channel his own mana towards that point.\n\n'How did he know!' Blevin screamed internally.\n\nBut before he could do anything, he felt the energy leaving his body.\n\nAs Blevin cursed his poor luck, Wei Zao reeled back and jabbed at the same point once again while screaming, \"2!\"\n\nBlevin's started to sweat as he anticipated what was about to happen next.\n\nPUNCH \"3!\"\n\nPUNCH \"4!\"\n\nPUNCH \"5!\"\n\nAfter the fifth punch, Blevin summarily evacuated his bowels and fell over into his mess. He couldn't control his body at all. The first two punches were sufficiently cushioned by his superior physique, but the following three struck while his body was powerless. He wanted to cry but couldn't shed any tears because his entire body had shut down at this point.\n\n\"Thank you for the 5 hit head start, Teacher. I am grateful,\" Wei Zao said in a mocking tone.\n\nThe incontinent Blevin was so agitated that he started to throw up blood uncontrollably.\n\n\"Wow... I never knew that people could actually throw up blood in real life... It doesn't make any anatomical sense...\" Guy muttered as he mused at the situation.\n\nWei Zao casually dusted his clothes and walked towards the wooden box next to the ring, under the sparkling gazes of Gaige and Mai. He picked it up, bowed towards the crowd and walked away.\n\nEveryone present slowly dispersed while gossiping about what just happened. The only two people that remained were Guy and Markus.\n\n\"Wait! He just took all the resources! Did he forget about us?\" Guy screamed.\n\nSadly no one minded him. And those who did hear him channelled the noise through one ear out the other.\n\nGuy hung his head and sighed, \"What do we do now?\"\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-023]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":197,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 021 - Wei Zao vs. the First Arrogant Young Master","n":0.302},"1":{"v":"\nWei Zao and Gaige were making decent progress towards the apprentice tournament. While Wei Zao hadn't advanced in his cultivation, which was still at the Late stage of Mana Condensation, Gaige had advanced to the Middle stage. Over the past few weeks, Gaige had also stabilised his cultivation.\n\nAfter taking the Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion, Gaige's affinity with darkness aligned mana had skyrocketed. With the assistance of the Specialised cultivation method, Gaige was making amazing progress in his comprehension of the darkness element and was becoming increasingly familiar with how to use it. Although, his temperament was also growing more morose and taciturn, which was to be expected.\n\nSince cultivation methods are inherently designed to broaden a mage's will, they tend to askew the practitioner's personalities accordingly. A mage practising a cultivation method based on fire would subconsciously have a passionate and intense personality, while a mage practising a wood-based method would be more quiet and contemplative. \n\nThis doesn't mean that every fire focused mage is a hot-head. There are variations as not everyone obtains similar insights in their cultivation.\n\nUltimately, the duo hit a roadblock. As they calculated their rate of progression, they realised it would be impossible to break through to Late stage Mana Condensation realm by the time the tournament arrived.\n\nWhile it wasn't a necessity to reach that stage, it definitely increased the chances of winning the tournament.\n\nThe issue they faced was that they just didn't have enough resources to facilitate the advancement. In actuality, a mage could advance organically by cultivating diligently. But this method is painfully slow.\n\nIt may take an average mage over 5 years to reach Foundation Establishment from Early stage Mana condensation. This assumes that the mage achieves an insight in their cultivation that resonates with them and is stable enough to act as a foundation to build upon.\n\nThis process can be sped up through the use of Mana Crystals and Mana Replenishing Potions.\n\nThe mage's body naturally regenerates mana at a rate proportional to their cultivation realm. This can be sped up by meditation, taking regenerative potions, absorbing mana from mana crystals, or relocating to a place that is dense in mana.\n\nDuring cultivation, as the mana is circulated along the body's mana channels, it is naturally used up. A mage can deplete their entire reserve just by cultivating continuously for 2 hours.\n\nWithout an assistive resource to regenerate this mana, the mage is doomed to wait for at least 4 hours to replenish their reserves. \n\nThis is why Wei Zao even bothered to attend the periodic check-in sessions with his supervisor. Teaching apprentices are allocated a fixed amount of mana crystals and mana replenishing potions to be used on their personal students. They can only retrieve it from their supervising teacher.\n\nAfter exhaling a long and drawn out breath, Wei Zao opened Teacher Hinds' office door and stepped in.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Teacher Hinds,\" Wei Zao said as he walked in nonchalantly.\n\nWei Zao noticed that everyone was seated around a meeting table, and so he pulled out a chair and sat down.\n\n\"Gaige, sit!\" He said while tapping another seat next to him.\n\nWei Zao conveniently missed the increasingly distorted expression creeping on Blevin's face. The hate Blevin had for Wei Zao was ingrained into his bones. When Wei Zao deviated Blevin's student's cultivation progress, the academy had held Blevin responsible for the matter. Although he had some goodwill due to his rapid progression and superior aptitude, the academy had to acquiesce to the accusations of the student's parents and settle for monetary compensation. The amount was deducted from Blevin's account. Even since then, Blevin had an even greater dislike for Wei Zao.\n\nCurbing his hatred, Blevin resumed his previous \"conversation\" with Mai.\n\n\"As I was saying, Apprentice Louts,\" he started while slowly inching toward Mai Louts. Since Wei Zao was seated next to her, she couldn't retreat any further and had to bear with Blevin's disgusting advances.\n\nBlevin continued, \"my connection at the logistics department managed to source a Thunderbird Tailfeather. I know that your student has an affinity with the lightning element, so I asked him to pass it to me.\"\n\nHe then carefully opened the wooden box and revealed a vibrant feather. It was splashed in a rainbow colour which was oscillating periodically. Thunderbirds were known for their high affinity to the lightning element and were indigenous to the highest peaks of Serrated-Peaks Mountain Range. It was a belief that when a thunderstorm occurred during a particularly droughty season, it was the blessing of the majestic Thunderbirds.\n\nThunderbirds regularly shed their feathers as they channel natural lightning and manufacture thunderstorms. Once shed, these feathers deactivate and only hold a dormant lightning essence. The tailfeather in the wooden box was of that kind. It would have no other use apart from brewing a potion that can contain this essence. On the other hand, if a Thunderbird's feather is physically dislodged or plucked, then it would contain essence of an extremely high concentration. That can be used to manufacture weapons and far superior potions. But no one really wants to court death by sneaking up on a Thunderbird and plucking its feather.\n\nMai didn't want to accommodate Blevin's foul advances, but she recognised the benefits the tailfeather would offer to her student. Grinding her teeth, Mai reluctantly accepted the gift and handed it to her student. But deep down she felt icky.\n\nBlevin smiled triumphantly as Mai accepted the offer. He had cashed in a lot of favours to get his hands on that tailfeather. He was satisfied with the outcome though. At least now Mai would be grateful to him and look at him in a favourable light.\n\nHe suddenly seemed to recollect something and stood up abruptly from his seat. \"Oh! Don't forget to take this month's allocation of mana crystals and mana replenishing potions.\" \n\nBlevin returned to his desk and retrieved another, less decadent, box and brought it to the table. He placed it carefully and slid it towards Mai.\n\nGuy furrowed his brows. Those were supposed to be equally distributed amongst all of Blevin's apprentices.\n\nGuy spoke audibly, \"Umm, what about ours?\"\n\nAfter he finished he waited for an explanation. But no one even acknowledged him.\n\n'Mast, are you sure that there isn't an isolating ritual in place? Why can't they hear me?'\n\nMast signed and responded, (They heard you. It's just that to them, you're an insignificant presence.)\n\nGuy refused to accept this! But before he could do anything about it, Wei Zao spoke up.\n\n\"Wait a minute! I haven't received my student's allocated resources!\"\n\nBlevin sneered and scoffed in response by saying, \"What's the point? Does he even stand a chance? It would be wasted on him.\"\n\nWei Zao knitted his eyebrows and retaliated in displeasure. \"How can you say that? You aren't being fair -\"\n\nBlevin slammed his fists on the table and interrupted Wei Zao. In an aggressive tone, he jeered, \"I get to decide what is fair and what isn't. Do you know why? It's because I am stronger than you.\"\n\nAs a man from the modern era, Wei Zao still hadn't gotten used to this world's skewed perspective on how \"might makes right\". It just didn't harmonise with his inherent worldview.\n\nAnd so, with a morose expression, Wei Zao replied, \"We live in a civilised society, not a lawless jungle.\"\n\nBlevin guffawed in response, \"Stop being so naive. The laws you talk about are made by those with the strength to enforce them. If the Duke of Maika says that all men must chop off the tips of their ears, then all the men under the Duchy's umbrella must do it. That is strength!\" he said in a patronising tone.\n\nWei Zao's eyes widened as it suddenly hit him. This entire time he'd been cruising through this world treating it as an extension of the world he came from. Even though he had the old memories of his current body, he didn't take it seriously primarily because he wasn't there to personally experience them. \n\nBlevin's revelation summarised the common belief of this world succinctly. As Wei Zao pondered over it, the expression on his face solidified and evoked a sense of immense confidence.\n\nGuy, who was observing the situation, noticed the changes in Wei Zao's face and sighed while lowering his head. Markus leaned towards Guy and whispered, \"Is there something wrong Master?\"\n\nGuy shook his head and answered, \"It's nothing. I'm just a little disappointed.\"\n\n\"Why, Master? Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"I just wish I could stand up for you and fight for you. But I'm not strong enough,\" Guy lamented.\n\nMarkus curled his fingers into a fist. His body started to shake as he disgested his Master's words. He wanted to comfort his Master and tell him that he didn't care about any of that. He also wanted to tell his Master that it was alright and that the lengths his Master had gone through for him were memories he'd cherish his entire life. \n\nBut Markus just couldn't verbalise his emotions. He also didn't want to offend his Master by implying that he was weak.\n\nWei Zao stood up from his seat and resolutely challenged Blevin, \"If that's the case, then I challenge you to a duel! If I win, I get double the allocated resources for my student -\"\n\nMai quickly interrupted Wei Zao by poking him with her elbows. Frankly, she had no idea why she acted that way. It wasn't her problem if Wei Zao wanted to have a bout with Blevin who had a clear advantage.\n\nBut she was a little amazed by how he was so willing to stand up for his student even in the face of adversity. So as a sincere gesture, she chose to warn Wei Zao so that he could save himself from some face.\n\nWei Zao, though, took the gesture to mean something else altogether. He was also observant of the awkward and one-sided advances Blevin made towards Mai. So when he saw her nudging him with a pleading gaze, he boldly added another declaration. \n\"- and I want you to stop pursuing Apprentice Louts.\"\n\nMai's eyeballs nearly burst out of their sockets.\n\n'What the hell are you doing?' she screamed internally. 'That's not what I wanted!'\n\nBut of course, Wei Zao couldn't hear any of that. He was stubborn and just couldn't take Blevin's sleights anymore.\n\nBlevin sneered in response and accepted the challenge, \"Fine! But if I win, then you will resign from your apprenticeship and leave this city. If I ever see you again, I will break every bone in your body and hang you on a pole by the city's walls! Don't blame me for being ruthless,\" he said in a threatening tone.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-022]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":198,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 020 - My Face-Slapping Sense is Tingling!","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nWhile Al was experimenting, Markus was taking down notes on the workbook according to his observations. \n\nIn this world, the field of education had stagnated significantly. While there were courses on basic arithmetics, arts, civics, literature, and philosophy, there wasn’t any field similar to science from Guy’s old world.\n\nThe only “technology” that was in this world was tied intimately with magic and mana. These included magical engineering, enchanting, and alchemy to name a few.\n\nSo when Markus was exposed to this fascinating new world of science, he was immediately taken with it. Everything made sense. And things that didn’t make sense could be verified by simple tests and experiments.\n\nOn top of that, one didn’t need to have a profound cultivation realm to get involved in it! Compared to the almost nonsensical cultivation mantras he read through before, this was more coherent.\n\nAl and Guy both observed the excitement with which Markus filled in the workbook.\n\nAl reached into his storage disk and retrieved a badge with a symbol of an open book on it. He handed it to Markus.\n\nMarkus jolted in his seat and quickly shook his hand, “Sir! I cannot accept your seal as I already have a master.”\n\nAl patted Markus on his shoulder and instructed, “Relax. I assume that you will need access to the Academy’s alchemy lab to conduct most of the experiments in this book. Show this seal to the caretaker, and he’ll let you in. You can also check out items under my name.”\n\nMarkus’ eyes widened in excitement. He turned towards his master to ask for permission. Guy couldn’t bring himself to say no in front of those pleading eyes, so he nodded in affirmation.\n\nMarkus carefully pocketed the badge and continued filling in the information in his workbook.\n\nGuy diverted his attention to the mana-powered clock at the back of the library and nearly jolted in his seat.\n\n“Markus we need to go! We need to check in with my Supervisor, Teacher Hinds.”\n\nMarkus carefully closed the workbook and packed up his stationery. The two then briskly walked towards Blevin Hinds’ office.\n\nAn academy's fame and prestige was directly correlated to the number of accomplished teachers that were in its employ. More specifically, it depended on the number of teachers with starred licenses. \n\nIn Gaea, individuals with licensed certificates in particular professions are valued highly. It is a direct indicator of how proficient they are in that singular field. Of them, the teaching license holds the highest position. This is because the metaphorical distance between levels of a teaching license is exponential, as opposed to other professions where it is mostly linear. A 2-star teacher must hold 2-star licenses in two different professions. Similarly, a 3-star teacher must have 3-star licenses in three different professions.\n\nWhile Blevin had secured a position as a teacher in Radiant Academy, he was not an officially certified one. In fact, he was currently working towards a 1-star enchanting license so that he could finally become eligible to apply for a 1-star teaching license.\n\nTo academies, teachers such as Blevin Hinds were considered promising investments. Whenever an employed teacher showed potential, the academies would sink more resources into nurturing them and pushing them forward in their careers.\n\nOnce these talents achieved their starred teaching licenses, they would inevitably raise the value of the schools they were employed in.\n\nSure, it was a possibility that the newly licensed teachers would leave their current academy. But that rarely happened because they would subconsciously feel a sense of gratitude to the academy for supporting them.\n\nThis was one of the ways academies retained talents. As opposed to hiring externally, organic growth was sustainable. Additionally, as academies grew in fame, more accomplished teachers would be drawn towards it, since an increase in fame and power would correspond to growth in wealth and access to rarer resources.\n\nAs of now, Guy wasn't sure of what he wanted to achieve in this world. His motivation was to teach, but he couldn't decide whether he should work towards a teaching license. As a new migrant into this world, he was still trying to figure things out and he didn't want to make any hasty decisions.\n\n'One step at a time,' he told himself while knocking at Teacher Hinds' office door.\n\nAn affirming grunt resounded from the other end. This was how Blevin usually indicated for visitors to enter. Blevin didn't know whether the visitors were of a higher position, or if they were below him. But he grunted nonetheless. Apparently, his arrogance didn't discriminate. Guy kind of respected that...\n\nGuy slowly opened the door and performed a salutation offered to individuals of a higher stature by bowing in a light thirty-degree angle.\n\nThe room was moderately sized. There was a desk for the occupant at the back of the room, and right next to the entrance there was a table with a few seats next to it, to hold impromptu meetings.\n\nNot all teachers in the academy could enjoy the luxury of having an individual room. This mere detail spoke volumes of how valuable Blevin was for the Radiant Academy. It was highly unusual for a 21-year-old Foundation Establishment mage to qualify for a teaching position. There were usually multiple stringent tests following the teaching apprenticeship that evaluated the basics of cultivation.\n\nMost individuals would extend their apprenticeship for a few more years just to gain more knowledge and broaden their horizons. Ultimately, the average age of earning a teaching position was 25 to 27-years-old.\n\n\"Larks? Why're you here?\" Blevin remarked curtly. Clearly, he wasn't pleased to see Guy. To Blevin, apart from Mai Louts, his other two apprentices were eyesores. He could tolerate Guy, but he simply hated the guts on Jo Way!\n\n\"We were supposed to check in today to track our student's progress,\" Guy reminded him.\n\nBlevin scratched his head while wearing an annoyed expression. He flipped through a book on his table to verify. Once he found the entry for today's date, he clicked his tongue and scrunched his face.\n\nHe then pointed at a table near the entrance. Guy and Markus respectfully sat down around the table and waited for the meeting to begin.\n\nNot a minute later, another knock was heard from the door, to which Blevin unleashed his standard grunt. The door opened with a confident swing, and a familiar woman stepped in.\n\nThe frown on Blevin's face evaporated instantaneously.\n\n\"Apprentice Louts! You're right on time. Please take a seat,\" he said with a sweet intonation.\n\nAlthough he was ogling at the woman's near impeccable face, he failed to observe the clear displeasure rendered on it.\n\nMai strutted towards the table and pulled out a seat opposite Guy and sat down. A student that looked like a spiritual carbon copy of Mai strode in arrogantly and sat down beside her teacher.\n\nMarkus nodded his head to greet the student, but the girl snorted and turned her head perfunctorily.\n\nMarkus lowered his head in embarrassment. He criticised himself internally for reaching out. After basking in the open and jovial environment cultivated by his Master, he had forgotten the cruel indifference of the world around him.\n\nGuy shook his head and patted Markus' shoulders. He had also observed the interaction between his and Mai's students. Although as a modern teacher he was inclined to reach across the aisle and instruct the girl to be more accomodating of people, he held himself back. This world didn't consider bullying to be detrimental to student health. It actually encouraged such \"friendly rivalry\".\n\nWhile he knew that to others, such behaviour was acceptable and a natural course in a student's life, Guy was not willing to budge on his stance on bullying. He sincerely wanted to seek retribution for Markus, but his logic prevailed and held him back. He knew that as a grunt in society, he didn't have any power or hold any influence. He could only swallow his grievance and support his student emotionally.\n\nMeanwhile, Blevin finished his tasks and walked towards the meeting table, with a wooden box in his hands. He gently placed the box on the table and sat down close to Mai.\n\nMai wore a pleasing smile but slowly nudged her seat away from Blevin. Her face and body language spoke two different things. She was disgusted by Blevin's blatant toadying, but she could only swallow her disgust and ingratiate herself to the man. He was her superior after all.\n\nThis was another thing that irked Guy. As a man, he recognised his privilege. Even in this world, where both genders potentially have the opportunity to stand equally as mages, men had a distinct advantage. The issue was not related to physical strength, but mental and emotional conditioning. As this world was still in the dark ages, women were conditioned from a young age to be submissive. Even with the power to overturn the universe, the goddess immortal would subconsciously act reservedly to a male opponent of equal strength.\n\nSo presently, Guy could only watch as Blevin started to get handsy with Mai, who was fidgeting in discomfort.\n\nWhat surprised Guy, though, was that they were completely ignoring him and Markus. It was as if they were invisible.\n\nGuy coughed audibly and still didn't receive any reaction.\n\n'Hey, Mast! Is there some kind of an occluding ritual or spell in motion?'\n\n(Nope. They just don't care about you,) Mast replied.\n\nAt this point, even Guy was feeling queasy watching the blatant sexual harassment. Just as he was about to speak, the door burst open and a familiar face walked in.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Teacher Hinds,\" Jo Way said as he walked in nonchalantly.\n\nAs Guy observed the self-important way in which Jo just burst into his supervisor's room, he felt the hair at the back of his neck stand upright.\n\n'My face-slapping sense is tingling!'\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-021]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":199,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 019 - Science in Magic","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nEarlier, when Guy and Markus split up for breakfast, Guy was in a bit of a pickle. Although he didn’t want to lie to his disciple, he couldn't just reveal that he was from another world. Although he believed in the free dissemination of knowledge, there were some things best left unsaid.\n\nAnd so, Guy spent a good chunk of time coming up with a decent explanation to support his new \"discoveries\". That was how he came up with the idea of the True World Theory.\n\nGuy was unskilled in stitching together mistruths out of nothing. Therefore, he resolved to borrow from Earth's history and made modifications here and there so that it would make sense for the people in this world. The True World Theory was an appellation he threw together that corresponded to the amalgamation of all the knowledge he brought over from his original world. He planned to use it as a convenient catch-all for ideas and concepts that were foreign in this world.\n\nIn the end, though, he only needed to build a facade that could stand on its own at a cursory glance. He wasn't expecting anyone to obsess over it. Even Mast's sibling wouldn't preoccupy themself over it. Guy was convinced that Tron would probably write it off as a revolutionary thinker trying to stay low-key to not attract too much attention.\n\nEvidently, the result was a tad outlandish and a little fanatical. As Guy listened to himself say it out loud, he felt as if he was a preacher initiating new members into an up and coming cult.\n\n‘Believe in the True World, and ascend!’ Guy delivered internally. He quickly shook that thought away and returned to his audience.\n\n“True World?” Al muttered as he digested the new information. “But how were they able to arrive at that conclusion?” he asked in response.\n\nGuy answered, “According to the books that I read, it said that when they travelled to other realms, they were able to sense mana. It was only their realm that was devoid of it. They then began to conduct experiments in all the different realms they had access to and found that without mana, certain behaviours and phenomenon were consistent. But when they introduced mana, these behaviours began to deviate and that too without any consistency. Following that, they concluded that in a world without mana, the True World, things worked the way they were supposed to. By introducing mana, you essentially lied to the True World and caused it to deviate.”\n\nAl scrunched his eyebrows and probed, “How did that lead you to develop this spell?”\n\n“I used that ideology to guide me as I developed the spell. The books from the travelling merchant didn’t contain any spells. All they contained were the theories developed by the Homo Sapiens. I used their theories as a basis and created this spell, which is as close as we can get to the True World,” Guy replied.\n\nMarkus tilted his head and spoke sheepishly, “Master, I don’t understand…”\n\nGuy nodded knowingly and presented an analogy, “Consider the following case. An acquaintance of yours asks to borrow some money from you, but you know that he is unreliable and don’t want to give him any money. However, this acquaintance is pretty close to you and you don’t want to spoil your relationship with him. How would you get out of this predicament?”\n\nMarkus pondered for a bit and said, “I’d think of an excuse.”\n\n“OK! What excuse can you think of?”\n\n“I’d say I don’t have any money to lend,” Markus replied confidently.\n\nGuy shook his head and retorted, “He would know your monetary situation before asking you for money. If you tell him you don’t have any he’d only get more suspicious.”\n\n“Then I’d show him proof. Maybe I could ask my sister to hide the money away when he isn’t looking…” Markus started to conjure up an elaborate strategy to convince this hypothetical defaulting relative.\n\n“Stop, stop! You came with such a long-winded strategy to accomplish something so simple. Can’t you just tell him that you’re saving up to purchase something big? He would immediately give up since you were upfront and transparent with him,” Guy proposed.\n\nMarkus opened his mouth as it dawned upon him that an easy solution was right before his eyes.\n\n“The purpose behind this whole exercise was to show you how this spell works. The other spells that you see here in this library are like a longwinded lie. They contain way too many unnecessary details and use up a lot of mana to hold up. This spell is a short and straightforward lie. It hits only the important points and requires only the amount of mana to just get the job done.  \nSo in other words, spells are lies you tell the True World to make it do what you want. And how do you spin the most convincing lies? You keep it as close to the truth as possible. That is the importance of the True World Theory.”\n\nAs Guy exhaled a long breath, his audience members nodded their heads vigorously as they digested everything.\n\nAl felt the information was revolutionary. His foundation was literally bursting from within, urging him to devour this new knowledge. He held himself back with great difficulty while soothing himself, ‘One at a time now, first the Beast Tamer license, then this.’\n\nGuy closed the topic with a question for Markus, “As it stands, I can give you two options. One, I will try to develop a few more spells and hand them to you. You can grind them and push your cultivation forwards. Two, aside from grinding, I can also teach you about this True World Theory so that you can gain a better understanding of what you are doing. Since you are my disciple, I highly recommend option two. But in the end, it’s your choice. What will it be?”\n\nMarkus dipped his head and stared at the spell construct in front of him. He spent the entire breakfast time deciphering it, but he ended up short.\n\nHe replied resolutely, “I also think option two would be better. In fact, I want to know more about how this spell works.”\n\nGuy smiled and reached into his carry bag. He pulled out a workbook and handed it to Markus. Apart from building up a decent lie, Guy didn't slack off during breakfast. He used the computer in the RoK to compile the introductory chapters from the elementary school science textbooks into a workbook. Presently, the book was incomplete. Guy planned to fill it up as Markus worked through it.\n\nMarkus carefully held the workbook and opened it up. On the very first page, the following words were written: “To learn about the True World, One must follow the scientific method.”\n\nMarkus asked, “Master, what is the scientific method?”\n\n“It is the way by which Homo Sapiens did their research. It is a very rigorous process that ensures the integrity of their experiments, and the accuracy of their results. Instead of telling you about it, I think the chapter should help you figure it out. But I’m going to leave you to work it out later. Give the book here for a second.”\n\nGuy took the workbook from Markus and turned to a different page, “This should explain how the spell works.”\n\nAl scooted over to Markus, leaned in and started to read through the workbook as well.\n\nMarkus started to read audibly, “For a fire to burn, it needs three things: Heat, Fuel, and Oxygen.”\n\n“Master, what’s oxygen?”\n\nGuy replied, “It is a type of gas that exists in the air. It is the same gas that you breathe.”\n\n“So you’re saying that there are different types of gases in the air?” Markus asked in disbelief.\n\nGuy nodded. Al thought about it and speed read through the rest of the chapter. Within the workbook, there were experiments that Markus could perform, and space to jot down his observations.\n\nAl looked through the methodology and quickly pulled out a palm-sized plate from a pocket inside his jacket.\n\nHe then channelled his mana into the plate. Almost instantly, a myriad of apparatus and items materialised on the table.\n\n“That’s a storage disk!” Markus exclaimed. Al smiled and sorted the items on the table. He had pulled out a transparent beaker, a set of transparent test tubes, a heating and a cooling rack. The racks had spell formations etched on them that ensured the items placed in them were at a steady temperature.\n\nHe also removed a piece of coal from his storage disk and, using a knife, cut out equally sized small pieces.\n\nHe placed one of the coal pieces on a fire-proof pad and ignited it. As the flame bloomed, he followed the first instruction on the workbook at covered the flame with the beaker.\n\nMarkus and Al both moved closer to observe the flame. As seconds passed, they saw the flame decrease in intensity until it was completely doused, while the piece of coal remained.\n\n“It really does breathe,” Al murmured. “How do you know what gas is being used?”\n\nGuy thought about it and replied, “There are methods that can be used to differentiate between the gases. To understand them you’d need to learn more. It won’t make any sense otherwise.\" \n\nThe teaching voice resurfaced as he elaborated, \"An intuitive way to go about it is to think about how blacksmiths stoke their flames. If you blow on fire, it burns out. But if you lightly fan it, it starts to grow. We can surmise that the gas you exhale is detrimental to the fire. Naturally, that gas must also exist in the atmosphere. So if the flame grows when you fan it, that means that in the air you exhale, there is less of the gas beneficial for fire, and more gas that is detrimental to it.”\n\nAl nodded and continued with the experiments. The next thing he did was place a coal piece inside a test tube and ignited it. He then lowered the tube into the cooling rack and observed the flame. As described in the workbook, the flame slowly diminished.\n\nFinally, Al commented in awe, “These experiments are really interesting. In fact, we already know all these mechanics through common sense, but we don’t think too deeply about it. The way this book breaks down the components and isolates them into different controlled tests is quite fascinating.”\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-020]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":200,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 018 - First Disciple","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nDisciples and student may mean the same thing by their definition. But in fact, there was a massive gulf that separated the two statuses.\n\nA student could be anyone enrolled in an academy or teaching establishment. It could also be someone that frequented lectures or talks given by notable individuals. In essence, students are affiliated with any organisation or individual. Personal students are just regular students but with a temporary supervisor.\n\nDisciples, on the other hand, are special. Disciples are directly connected to their Masters. Becoming a disciple of a teacher was akin to gaining a new parent. The master would hold many responsibilities apart from simply relaying knowledge to their disciples. They would also be required to raise them and guide them in their path. As a result, disciples tended to follow their masters in their journeys.\n\nA master-disciple relationship is evoked through an informal process. There aren’t registries that indicated whether someone was a disciple of a particular teacher or not. This affiliation is ascertained by the coat of arms or symbol adorned by the disciple, matching their master’s. Qualified teachers, especially those with a star certification, would develop their own unique seal. When the teachers took on disciples in the future, they would allow them to decorate their outfit with this seal. This would be an indication that the disciple is affiliated with said teacher.\n\nAlthough the initiation was informal, the master-disciple bond is taken very seriously. One doesn’t invoke this relationship on a whim. Breaking a master-disciple bond was a shameful deed, biased in favour of the master. Even if the disciple’s rank and capacity far exceeded their master’s, the master-disciple connection would still remain. The disciple was naturally required to be respectful to their master. This was why Guy advised caution at Markus’ seemingly impetuous decision to establish a master-disciple relationship.\n\nHearing Markus’ resolute declaration, and his bent figure, Guy was taken aback. Based on this body’s memory, taking on a disciple or recognising a master was considered a huge deal.\n\nWhile he was fine accepting Markus, Guy admitted that he was probably viewing this situation from a modern man’s lens.\n\nIn his old world. The idea of becoming a disciple was an archaic concept. While it still persisted in some old customs, with the ubiquity of the internet most knowledge was no longer hoarded or withheld like in the olden days. If someone wanted to learn a new skill, finding a skilled teacher was more often than not only a few clicks away. \n\nGuy realised that such ubiquity was not a thing in this world. Even within the Academy’s library, which was supposed to be a public repository, there were closed-off sections inaccessible to the regular folk.\n\nAnd so Guy decided to caution Markus, “While I would love to accept you as my disciple, I do have to warn you. I am just a teaching apprentice. I want you to think carefully before you make this decision.”\n\nMarkus smiled self-deprecatingly, “You don’t understand, Sir. That day, during fresher’s week, I was this close to giving up,” he said while pinching his fingers.\n\nMarkus sighed and continued, “As you already know, I’m an orphan. I am from an orphanage in a sparse village five days away from Radiant City. The village is right at the foot of the Serrated-Peaks Mountain Range, bordering the Green-Sky Forest. To get there, you need to take a long detour from the trade routes. You can already guess, the security situation. We live on the edge every day.”\n\n“I’m the oldest back at the orphanage. My siblings and I scraped and scrounged to save just enough to send me here. I have just enough to pay the fees for a year and a half, only just,” he commented solemnly.\n\n“I… I…” as he tried to continue, tears started to flow down his cheeks. “I was ready to give up everything! I was… I was going to …”\n\nMarkus quickly brought his sleeves to his face and dried his tears. He wore a serious expression and continued speaking with a stable voice.\n\n“You have no idea how much this means to me,” Markus declared as he picked up the neatly folded spell diagram.\n\n“You’ve given me hope. It would be my absolute honour to become your disciple. So please,” Markus stood up once again and bowed at a ninety-degree angle, “I want to become your disciple, Master!”\n\nGuy smiled warmly and stood up in front of Markus, “Well, as long as you are confident and have thought it through.”\n\nHe placed his palm on Markus’ shoulders and declared, “I, Guy Larks, accept you, Markus Reva, as my first disciple!”\n\nMarkus straightened his back and beamed in excitement. He then lowered his head and brought his hands together in a praying gesture. “I, Markus Reva, greet my Master, Guy Larks!”\n\nGuy returned the gesture and completed the ceremony.\n\n____\n\nMarkus called out, “Master,” and then smiled as he mentally processed his new master-disciple relationship. Although his master wasn’t a certified teacher or even a complete teacher for that matter, he was extremely elated. He held immense respect for his master. His master never gave up on him and accomplished something that most people had written off as impossible. He had found a way for Markus, who was magically inept, to advance in his cultivation.\n\n“Sit, sit! I hope you had breakfast? We have a lot to go through today,” Guy said while gesturing for Markus to take a seat next to him.\n\nThe two were back at the library at Guy’s usual spot. It was sufficiently secluded that other’s wouldn’t be disturbed by their hushed conversation. Although, most advanced mages could still hear them with their improved senses.\n\n“Yes, master!” Markus answered sheepishly and sat down obediently in a chair next to Guy.\n\n“Alright, so-” but before Guy could continue with his lesson, a familiar call interrupted him.\n\n“Wait for me!”\n\nGuy and Markus both turned in the direction of the voice and saw an excited Al walking briskly towards them. Al shamelessly pulled a seat opposite Guy and looked at them with an expectant gaze.\n\nSeeing as the two were simply staring at him, Al waved his hand and said, “Go on! I’m just observing.”\n\nGuy nodded and diverted his attention back to his disciple, “Alright, so I guess you have a lot of questions?”\n\n“Yes, master. I -” but again they were interrupted by Al,\n\n“Master? Hold up! Did you accept this kid as your disciple?” Al exclaimed in an uncharacteristically high-pitched voice.\n\nGuy looked at Al in defeat causing the guilty party to gesture by pressing an extended index finger against his lips. Guy exhaled and indicated to Markus to continue.\n\n“So during breakfast, I was going through the spell construct once again. As you already know, I’ve studied quite a few spells from this library, but I don’t think I’ve seen anything like this one,” said Markus in a confused tone.\n\nGuy nodded in affirmation and replied, “Of course it isn’t here. I developed it.”\n\nThe revelation received similar responses from Al and Markus. For Al, it was a little bit more exaggerated since he actually knew, as an intellectual, exactly how difficult it was to develop new spells.\n\n“Well, I didn’t make it from scratch. I put pieces together and developed them. If you look at it carefully, the spell is basically a modular construct made up of both sequential and parallel components,” Guy explained while pointing at the pertinent sections on the spell construct.\n\n“What are these symbols?” Al asked. Markus nodded as this was also something he didn’t fully understand.\n\n“Remember when I told you about the books I purchased from the travelling merchant? These symbols were scattered in it, with explanations supporting what they meant,” Guy articulated while infrequently glancing at Al. When he saw that Al was nodding in contemplation, he relaxed. Guy wanted to make sure that there weren’t any holes in his explanation. He knew Al was a smart cookie, and so he couldn’t half-ass it.\n\nMarkus scratched his head, “Which book are you talking about, master?”\n\nGuy smiled wryly and began his anecdote, “When I was little, I used to love to read a lot of books. As you know, books can get expensive, and since the orphanage I lived in was quite poor, we had to make do with very little. Luckily, the matron was acquainted with a travelling merchant that passed through our village regularly. Every time he stopped by, he would unload stacks of books that were about to fall apart. He would donate those books to the orphanage. I used to always look forward to those days when he would stop by.”\n\nAs he spoke, he modulated his tone to his signature teacher’s voice. “One day, he brought a stack of books that were in near-mint condition. When I asked him, he said that he tried selling them, but no one would buy them. The customers always complained that the contents made no sense, and were really boring.  \nFor me, that didn’t matter. Books were books, I didn’t have the luxury to be choosy. And so I started reading those books. At first, things didn’t make sense. But after I finished them once, and read through them again. I got a clearer picture of what they were talking about.”\n\nGuy paused and gauged the mood of his audience. As a teacher, orating was a valuable skill. Especially back when he was going from village to village in his old world. He had picked up methods to quickly attract the attention of little kids and keep them hooked. Unsurprisingly, he had completely bewitched Markus. When he turned his head, he saw Al looking at him with a very weird gaze. It was almost as if he wanted to devour Guy whole. It gave him goosebumps. \n\nHe quickly shook it off and continued speaking, “The books were actually records written by a long-forgotten race from an old realm.”\n\nThat revelation registered gasps from both his audience members. Although, Al was wearing a sceptical look.\n\nAccording to Guy’s research, realms were a highly debated topic in this world. The word itself was used ambiguously. Some said that a realm was an alternate dimension. Others said that realms connected to different worlds. As a world-traveller, Guy was somewhat of an expert in this field. Well no one else apart from him, and maybe Jo, had traversed from another world so he was the expert by definition. \n\nBut Guy decided to gamble on this ambiguity and make an assertion, “The race was called Homo Sapiens, and the realm they lived in was extremely scarce in mana.”\n\nGuy saw that Al had loosened his frown. It appeared as if he bought this lie. After mentally pumping his fists, Guy continued, “Since the world lacked mana, the Homo Sapiens had to make do and develop ways to survive in their harsh environment.  \nAnd it is their unique perspective borne from the unusual circumstance that led them to develop in a completely novel direction.”\n\nGuy took a deep breath, grit his teeth and stated, “They theorised that the world was inherently devoid of mana. They called this model, the ‘True World’.”\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-019]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":201,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 017 - Scrutiny","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nUnsurprisingly, Markus passed out in exhaustion.\n\n“The poor boy was holding in a lot,” Al commented as he carefully inspected the sleeping Markus’ condition.\n\nAl and Guy were now back at Markus’ dormitory.\n\n“I can imagine. I’ve seen kids like this before. He had nearly lost all hope. His soul was burnt-out and lifeless,” Guy spoke morosely.\n\n“By the way, where did you find that spell? I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Al asked inquisitively.\n\n“Umm,” Guy searched for a decent response. He didn’t want to tell him that he made it himself. While it would be the truth, Al wouldn’t believe him, and in the end, it would only alienate their relationship as Al would think Guy was trying to be disingenuous.\n\nAl thought he stepped on some forbidden ground. There were always secrets when it came to cultivating. “If it’s a secret, you don’t have to say anything,” he said while trying to smooth things out.\n\nGuy shook his head in reply, “It’s not that I don’t want to tell you. I’m just apprehensive because I worry that you won’t believe it...”\n\nAl tilted his head in contemplation, and smiled, “You can try me.”\n\nGuy wore a shy expression and replied, “Back when I was at the orphanage, a travelling merchant once passed by and sold a large stack of books that talked about strange ideas and inventions. At first, I read it for fun. But over time some things started to make sense. However once I grew up, I kind of threw them away at the back of my mind. When I was struggling to come up with a solution for Markus, my mind just recollected all that information and I felt it wouldn’t hurt to try it out.”\n\nOf course, that was all a lie. If the old Guy had such an encounter, he wouldn't have been stuck in such a dead-end position.\n\nActually, Guy formulated this backstory based on a whim. He didn’t want to leave any loose ends that Al could later catch onto, and so he thought that it would be best to chuck all of it to a fortunate encounter in his past. Nearly all successful mages had such encounters, so Guy figured that Al wouldn't pursue it any further.\n\nAl nodded and then shrugged, “I guess you had a fortuitous encounter. Those things are few and far between. Surprisingly it was more helpful for your student than yourself,” he commented as he turned to face the sleeping Markus.\n\nAl tapped his thighs as he stood up, “Alright then. It’s getting pretty late. Why don’t we discuss this again tomorrow? I’m really interested to know more about it!”\n\nAnd with that Al departed from the dorm.\n\nWatching Al's departing figure, Guy exhaled in relief. He had his fingers crossed and his breath held the entire time. He worried Al wouldn't be convinced and would push him to reveal more. Seeing as his gambit worked, Guy was relieved.\n\nHe then turned to face the unconscious figure in bed and smiled bitterly. On one hand, Guy was happy that Markus had such an emotional catharsis. But on the other, he was worried by the sheer magnitude of the release. It was extremely unhealthy for an adolescent to hold in so much. And so, Guy decided to stay back until Markus woke up and smooth things out through a meaningful heart-to-heart conversation.\n\n____\n\n[There’s a discontinuity here!] #**$#@, or Tron for the lower-dimensional peasant-folk, exclaimed as he rewatched the sequence of events leading up to a sudden surge in progress.\n\nThrough past experience, he had a general idea of how sentient beings in a world developed.\n\nThere were usually one of two trajectories. The first, and the one he hated the most, was the sequence based on non-secular reasoning. In his old world, one of the more advanced sentient species saw a tree fall in the forest. Unlike its brethren, the being decided to ponder on why the tree fell. Who was pulling the tree down?\n\nThe being looked around but didn’t find anyone. Considering itself to be smart, it decided to recruit a few of its kind and started to dig under the fallen tree. Maybe there was someone below pulling it down.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful excavation, all it was left with were a few bruises after its brethren vented their anger for wasting their time, a massive hole in the ground, and a lingering question.\n\nWho pulled the tree down? Who pulled me down? Who’s pulling everyone down? Give me answers damn it!\n\nScreaming into the high heavens, it still didn’t receive any answers. At the point of giving up, the being had an epiphany.\n\n‘Of course!’ it exclaimed. ‘It has to be the almighty Earth Spirit,’ it concluded. And thus the lore of how the Earth Spirit was holding down the world was born.\n\nTron hated these. The conclusion was never built on facts, and it always irked him when the sentient beings attributed his designs to an artificial construct. \n\n[It’s not the Earth Spirit damn it!] He would scream. Alas, no one would hear it.\n\nHe didn’t have a god complex per se. It’s just that he preferred it when the discovery was properly supported and disputable. Because it was only then that society would advance, and new creative juices would flow. And creativity was how the world builders thrived.\n\nApart from a stable world, a world builder aimed for a world that could output a lot of creativity. It was an abstract concept, but for the inherently insipid world builders, the machinations of the sentients in their worlds were equivalent to giving colourblind glasses to a colourblind person. Once a sentient being in their world expired, their soul, or the core of their being, is absorbed by the builders and gets recycled. During absorption, the builders get to experience everything the being went through in its life cycle.\n\nA few world builders would simply create a basic world that could sustain itself for eternity. But that was never enjoyable. How fun would it be to observe balls of gases or rocks floating in a void? Sure the world builders would live, but their life would be devoid of any colour.\n\nAnd while most world builders usually registered creative progression once they received feedback from deceased souls, Tron was an experienced veteran. He already had another world that was in its mid to late stages of development. He had formulated a method to gauge progression in its early stages. It was an arcane process - not something lower-dimensional beings could fathom.\n\n[How did he come up with this idea? He didn’t read any books about it. There shouldn’t be any books about it yet. This progress doesn’t follow the proper sequence,] Tron murmured as he metaphorically scratched his head.\n\nHe was currently observing the series of events leading up to when Guy first cast the modified firestarter spell.\n\n[Let’s see here…] Tron scrolled through the timeline. [He spent three weeks without making any progress, and then a massive leap within 2 hours!]\n\n[Who is this guy? How did I miss him?] Tron went further back.\n\n[Wait a minute, I remember this one!] Tron recollected the time when a particular mismatch in the sentient soul balance sheet had occurred.\n\n[He was ready to commit suicide here. But then not a minute later he changed his mind?]\n\nTron scratched his head as he tried to decipher what was happening. For a logical being such as himself, it made absolutely no sense.\n\n[And what the heck?! He lied over here,] Tron exclaimed as he saw how seamlessly Guy stitched together some bullshit about a fortuitous encounter. [He's hiding something!]\n\n[I can’t take this! I need to check this out myself!] Tron declared and zoomed into Guy, who was currently sleeping while seated on a chair in Markus’ dorm.\n\nGuy was sound asleep on the chair next to Markus’ bed. He was initially waiting for Markus to wake up, but in the process, his drowsiness got the best of him and he nodded to sleep.\n\nAll of a sudden, an immense pressure descended on him, which jolted him awake. It the same feeling he experienced when he first entered this world. Mast’s brother was observing him in person.\n\nStruggling to catch his breath, Guy slid limply from his seat and started to crawl towards the window. As he fell with a thud, he caused Markus to wake up. Noticing that his teacher was struggling on the floor, Markus quickly got up from his bed and rushed towards Guy.\n\n“Teacher Larks!” he exclaimed as he grabbed Guy under his shoulders and supported him to stand up.\n\n“Teacher Larks…. I….” Markus started to panic! He was just a 12-year-old boy. It looked as if his teacher was drowning. He didn’t know what to do.\n\nJust as Markus was about to break down, the pressure lifted from Guy. He wheezed as he tried to catch his breath. The experience was much worse than before, at least back then the observation was only cursory. This felt as if someone was digging into his soul and putting it under a microscope. He definitely did not want to experience this ever again.\n\n‘Mast! What happened?’ Guy interrogated.\n\n(My brother got suspicious. The spell you made was a massive leap in advancement in this world. It caught my brother’s attention. And well, your history doesn’t offer a genuine sequence to support it,) Mast replied in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\n‘You should have told me to be careful! I nearly died!’ Guy cursed.\n\nMast shook his head and replied, (He can’t kill you. If he does it would cause this world to collapse.)\n\n‘But still… I felt as if I was drowning,’ Guy mumbled\n\n(Don’t worry. You’ve set a precedent, so anything you do from now on shouldn’t raise his suspicion. Besides, as long as I’m inside you, he won’t know a thing!)\n\nMarkus interrupted Guy’s internal conversation with a worried probe, “Sir, are you alright?”\n\nThis caused Guy to turn ad face the panicking boy close to tears. Guy’s heart softened and he gently patted Markus’ shoulders, while he stood up shakily.\n\n“Don’t worry about it. It’s a persistent health issue. Happens from time to time. I’m sorry for causing you to worry.”\n\nMarkus sighed in relief. He quickly rushed to his study desk and poured out a glass of water. He carefully handed the glass to Guy and sat down obediently on his bed.\n\nGuy downed the entire glass and placed it on the bedside table next to him.\n\nMarkus broke the lingering silence first by saying, “Teacher Larks… I…” he quickly stood up and bowed at a complete ninety degrees. This was a sign of respect in this world.\n\n“I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart! I don’t have much to offer as a token of gratitude, and I know that I'm being presumptuous with this request, but I implore you that you please accept me as your disciple!” Markus exclaimed without stop.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-018]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":202,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 016 - Bane of Students...

The amount of progress he made in one hour blew the last three weeks out of the water.\n\nAs a logical thinker, Guy decided to use deductive reasoning to figure out a possible solution.\n\nIn some spell books, there were crude circles where the author tried using Common Tongue. While the spells worked, the mana expenditure was massive. With this, Guy developed a train of thought.\n\n‘Ancient Tongue is used because it is precise. The more precise the magic is, the less mana it uses. So if I use precise language, it should work, right?’\n\nAlthough Guy knew Common Tongue thanks to this body’s memories. He still felt that the language, like all others, was inherently ambiguous. In fact, there weren’t many words to describe some things such as Oxygen, or even Molecules, that were present in his old world.\n\nHe contemplated using English or one of the many languages he was fluent in from his original world. As a world traveller, Guy was fluent in quite a handful of languages. That was the only way he could develop a personal connection with his students since one couldn’t expect those from impoverished nations to learn fluent English. They had their own problems; it would be selfish of him to expect them to speak in unadulterated English.\n\nThis avenue was also a dead-end. While the words he wanted were present in those languages, he felt that there was still some ambiguity. So Guy shifted his direction slightly. He concluded that ‘for it to be precise, when a person simply sees or hears the word the corresponding object must be immediately brought to the forefront of their mind.’\n\nThat narrowed down his search considerably. What was the only language that transcended all cultural barriers back in his world?\n\nMaths!\n\nGuy laughed maniacally as he remembered all the groaning faces from when he taught maths to his students.\n\n‘You can run as far as you can, even transcend worlds, but Maths will always find you. One way or another. That tenacious bastard!’ Guy cheered.\n\nGuy realised that using mathematical and scientific notation would alleviate his precision problems. If he followed the standards used by experts in the field when they submitted articles or proceedings to globally published journals, he could get as close to precision as humanly possible.\n\nWith that problem out of the way, Guy started to formulate the spell chain.\n\nHe had to concentrate the oxygen in the atmosphere into one place and pressurise it. He then needed to concentrate compounds with flammable properties. Since he wasn’t sure if there was sufficient methane in the air, he decided to use solid hydrocarbons such as coals. He then needed to bring them together and energise them. To ignite the mixture, he needed to provide sufficient activation energy. Seeing as how combustion was self-sustaining, initiating a single reaction would be sufficient.\n\nAs he observed this chain superficially, Guy felt that it would work.\n\nGuy immediately put together the spell and printed it out from the computer in the RoK.\n\nMagically, the paper materialised in front of him in reality. Guy grasped the paper and rushed towards the librarian’s desk.\n\n“Mr. Jeeves! By chance, do you have any coal?” Guy asked excitedly.\n\nAl mimicked cleaning his ear to make sure that he heard correctly, “Coal? What do you want coal for?”\n\nGuy calmed himself. This was a massive breakthrough, he couldn’t fumble his words. “I think I did it! I found a spell that might work. But I need some coal.”\n\nAl became serious, “You found a spell? I’ve read all the books here. I don’t think there’s a spell that fits your needs,” he asked sceptically.\n\nGuy tried to brush off the inquiry and spoke hurriedly, “This one isn’t from here. I… remembered this one from way back. I don’t want to get into it right now, I need to see if it works.”\n\nWith an apprehensive gaze, Al went towards the heating furnace at the back of the library and fetched a palm-sized piece of charcoal. Although it was possible to set up a heating formation and maintain a steady temperature in the library, ritual formations used mana crystals or expensive catalysts. Alternatively, furnaces used coal or charcoal. By virtue of economic frugality, using a furnace was optimal.\n\nWith the charcoal in one hand, Guy started to measure his breath. This was a momentous occasion, and he could not afford to make any mistakes.\n\nGuy carefully placed the paper with the new magic circle in front of him and inspected it. He had already cast a few spells after transmigrating into this world. His old body’s memories and experience played a key role in his adapting. And so he was confident that he could cast the spell. Whether it worked or not, that was a completely different matter altogether.\n\nCarefully, Guy began to construct the magic circle with his will. To cast any spell, the will of the caster played a key role in materialising the spell’s framework. Without a proper framework, the spell couldn’t be activated by channelling mana from the caster.\n\nAl stared at the weird-looking magic circle in front of him. In all his years, he had never seen anything like it before. Although he could see some familiar shapes in the spell, the construction was a little different. Usually, magic circles had a sprawling form, but this one was more separated and modular.\n\nAl shifted his attention to Guy, and saw that he had completed constructing the circle. That meant that the spell would work. If the caster couldn’t build the framework of the spell, either through chanting, rituals or circle constructs, that meant that the spell was a dud. Al was pleasantly surprised at the outcome. Now all that was left was to see if it provided the desired outcome.\n\nGuy channelled his mana into the construct that was levitating on his free hand. As the mana escaped from his fingertips and powered the construct, it started to light up. On the other hand with the charcoal, a smaller circle formed and started to rotate.\n\nSimultaneously, an orange ball of fire lit up on his free hand.\n\nBoth Guy and Al stared at the fireball. \n\nBefore Al could say anything, Guy quickly extinguished the fire and bolted out of the door with the charcoal in one hand and the paper with the spell on the other, leaving Al with his mouth agape like a fish.\n\nGuy sprinted in wild abandon, shedding all pretence of his stature as a teacher, towards the public practising ground. He knew that Markus usually stayed there till sunset, and he didn’t want to miss him.\n\nWhen Guy cast the spell back in the library, he could feel the difference in the mana expenditure. It was significantly lower. His mind started to formulate some theories, but his emotions got the best of him. He really wanted to show it to Markus. Guy was confident that this was it!\n\nEveryone in the hallways and grounds saw a blurred figure run past them. For those in the Foundation Establishment realm and above, they were able to determine who it was with their advanced senses. But since no one had an opinion on Guy, they simply brushed it off flashing a disdainful gaze at his poor behaviour.\n\nBy the time Guy reached the practising grounds, he saw that there was only one sorry looking figure standing there. Even from this distance, Guy could recognise Markus.\n\nGuy felt a little ashamed. He was supposed to be a teacher. A person that students depended on. But the past three weeks weren't exemplary. With his unfocused floundering, he was sure that Markus was disappointed in him.\n\nBut Guy quickly shook his head. Although it was late, he was successful. He was proud of himself. He managed to keep his promise, in this foreign world, by relying only on himself and his capabilities. Sure he had Mast’s help in providing the computer and the RoK. But everything from researching, experimenting, and creating the spell was done by him alone. He was sure that even if Mast wasn’t there with the assist, Guy would have still accomplished the task, albeit he would take much longer.\n\nIn the middle of the run, Guy went through a multitude of emotions before settling down and centring himself.\n\nAs he approached Markus, Guy screamed, “Markus! I did it!”\n\nMarkus turned towards the source of the voice in confusion. What he saw was his revered teacher, running towards him with a piece of paper in one hand and a block of charcoal in the other. Not something Markus could have ever imagined in his lifetime. \n\nBut after hearing his teacher’s exclamation, he was shuddering in anticipation.\n\n‘Teacher found a solution?’ he repeated in his mind. With each repetition, his heart pumped harder.\n\nGuy stopped next to Markus and wheezed as he caught his breath. He had sprinted without pause from the library to the grounds, which was evidently much farther than this body could handle. Guy silently told Mast to remind him to work out afterwards. This just wouldn’t do. He had to uphold a certain image in front of his students. Guy conveniently erased the whole spectacle of him running like a maniac from his mental history.\n\nGuy handed Markus the piece of paper with the spell and the charcoal.\n\n“Try it! Make sure you keep the charcoal in your mana domain when you activate the spell though,” He instructed.\n\nThe mana domain was a region of mana around the mage that was under the mage’s control. Although the mana in this region was not mouldable by the mage unlike the mana inside them, it was under their influence and could be controlled.\n\nThe mana domain expanded as the mage advanced in their cultivation. For an Early stage Mana Condensation realm mage practitioner, the domain formed a sphere of a radius ranging between 2 to 3 metres from their core.\n\nMarkus calmed himself and focused his mana on the charcoal. Once he was sure that it was stable, he started to go through the magic circle on the sheet.\n\nThe construct looked novel to him. He had never seen anything like it in the library. But there was no room for doubt. His teacher handed it to him confidently, which meant this was legitimate.\n\nMarkus carefully formed the construct using his will, and it materialised on his free hand.\n\nMarkus exhaled and started to channel mana into the construct.\n\nWith every passing second, the tension inside him grew.\n\n‘Would this fail?’ he asked himself. ‘Please work!’ he pleaded. ‘COME ON!’ he screamed.\n\nLo and behold. A ball of fire materialised on his free hand.\n\n“YES!” Guy screamed. “We did it!” Guy said looking at Markus, who was blankly staring at the fireball in his hand.\n\n“Markus?” Guy nudged him.\n\n____\n\nAl was following Guy at a brisk pace. He was also a little excited. That magic circle was completely new, and Al was thirsting for some of that juicy new knowledge.\n\nBy the time Al reached the practising field, he was shocked by the sight.\n\nRight at the end of the field, Markus was on his knees and bawling. The raw emotions emanating from the wailing boy moved Al’s heart.\n\nThere was unbridled sadness, anger, relief, and even gratitude. Al knew right then and there that Guy had succeeded.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-017]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":203,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 015 - Modular Spellmaking","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy picked the first component shape on the list and tried to cast it in isolation. With circle-based magic, this was possible as long as the spell could be standalone. Some components had dependencies. For those spells, Guy would have to work backwards and cast the dependencies in tandem with it.\n\nWhile the RoK greatly amplified his rate of progress, it was technically considered an isolated space. His body was not physically present in here, only his consciousness was. Therefore, Guy had to alternate between the RoK and the real world when testing the spells. And so, Guy optimised the process by grouping up spells together and testing them in bulk to reduce the number of transitions.\n\nAs Guy went through the process, he gradually started to understand the perspectives of the people indigenous to this world. For them, magic was an arcane process in which the end justified the means. With things that didn’t make any sense to them, they simply chose to overlook it since all they cared about was the outcome.\n\n“This spell creates fire…Why? Who cares! It makes fire, that’s all that matters,” was the common thought process.\n\nWhile there were groups that specialised in spell research and development, the way they went about it lacked generalisability and repeatability. Essentially, their methodology was unique to the school of magic they were trained in, and an outsider would not be privy to the process. This inevitably led to a regression in the rate at which new spells were developed.\n\nUnlike back in Guy’s original world, where knowledge was accessible at everyone’s fingertips, this world, which was still stuck in the middle ages, kept knowledge on a need-to-know basis.\n\nUltimately, this problem was circular. Without dispersion of knowledge, there was a lack of varied perspectives, resulting in technological stagnation. And the advancements that did occur, happened at a snail’s pace.\n\nThanks to Guy’s out-of-this-world experiences, and with the help of the RoK and the technology within it, Guy was able to approach the problem with a unique perspective.\n\nAs a modern man who was initiated in the scientific process, Guy was able to systematically go through the decomposed component shapes and take pertinent notes on their purpose and effects.\n\nAfter a primary run through the components that worked in isolation, Guy realised that in each fire-based spell, there was a component that infused inflammable properties to mana. This produced what the locals called fire-infused mana or mana attuned to the fire element. There were additional properties to the mana such as conductivity to heat, which were implicit.\n\nWhat Guy realised was that the magic in this world went for a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n“Want to make a fire? Well, first let’s change a part of your mana to become inflammable. And while we’re at it let’s make it conductive. Oh, and why not make it volatile. And I almost forgot, the fire needs to burn continuously, lets add an oxidising agent as well!”\n\nGuy felt that the whole idea was redundant. There were already inflammable compounds in the air, there was also oxygen to sustain it. Why bother changing mana if a resource is already available with all the required properties?\n\nThe dependent components that followed added to this base infusion step and performed actions such as compression, dispersion, concentration, diffusion, repulsion, attraction, energising, de-energising, and so on. Those were the names Guy gave to those spells since their purpose was implicit in their effect. \n\nGuy decided to categorise these components as “Action Components”. They performed specific actions and were dependents. In order to gauge their effects, Guy used a basic spell called |Inspect|. It was considered a cantrip, but it was moddable to perform different tasks. Guy modified |Inspect| to observe the molecules of the substances in the area affected by the spells.\n\nHe then documented those Action Components for later use.\n\nAfter that, Guy moved on to the less frequent component shapes captured by the decomposing algorithm. \n\nMost of them were duds and didn’t have any purpose in the grand scheme of things. But the ones that stood out, were dubbed \"Source Components\" by Guy.\n\nThese Source Components were different from Action Components because they were independent. By design, they appeared similar to the fire-infusion component. But instead of sourcing mana, they sourced naturally occurring substances.\n\nFor instance, one Source Component appeared to draw in a large quantity of air from the environment to increase the size of a |Fireball| spell.\n\nAnd so, Guy scoured through the folders and managed to gather a list of Source Components.\n\nThis entire time, Guy had a particular goal in mind. When he worked as a teacher, he primarily taught kids who were in elementary school or middle school. While he did teach a few high-school courses, he preferred interacting with little kids over those hormone-fueled monsters. Furthermore, his charity efforts were geared towards increasing the base educational level and inevitably forced him into that speciality.\n\nAs a teacher, Guy aimed to increase the approachability of knowledge to those that didn’t explicitly show any interest in learning. For little kids, going to school and sitting in classes was simply a chore. It was something they had to slog through.\n\nIt was his job as a teacher to make them interested and capture their curiosity. To accomplish this, Guy would regularly scour various teacher forums and discussion boards to find novel ways to engage his students.\n\nOne of the topics he found most difficult to teach kids was coding and programming. In the age of information, working with technology and automation had become commonplace. It was almost impossible for someone to survive in a competitive STEM industry without having some knowledge of how to code. So it was inevitable for the topic to enter the school’s syllabus.\n\nAt first, it was only a high-school requirement. But over time, the topic began to breach into middle schools, and finally into some elementary schools.\n\nOne can only imagine how hard it was for a teacher to get a child interested in printing “Hello World” on their monochrome consoles windows.\n\nTo them, the conveniences provided by knowing a programming language were irrelevant. It just wasn’t exciting enough to learn. Guy blamed the media for glamorising the idea of programming for the layman. Typical coding sessions seldom involved flickering screens, lines of scrolling text, and intense techno music.\n\nIn Guy’s experience, a typical coding session usually meant hours of cursing at his screen, downing cans of caffeine-filled energy drinks, sleepless nights, and frantic searches on StackOverflow.\n\nSo the question at hand was: How to get kids interested in coding? \n\nGuy found that kids preferred it when their work displayed tangible results. Most of the time with coding, the results were abstract. Things happened on the screen, and lines of text were spewed out. They weren’t interesting at all.\n\nFrom various forum threads, Guy managed to find a coding framework perfect for kids called \"Scratch\". It was a programming language that was completely visual.\n\nIt contained specialised blocks that performed specific tasks and could be chained to form a script or a function. The best part was that the result of running a script was automatically evident in a graphical user interface. It was also possible to program peripherals using this language.\n\nIntroducing that kid-friendly programming language showed immediate results in his classroom. His students started to take initiative and came up with novel projects. The best part was that when those students reached a higher level and learned of the inherent limitations in the language, they were able to assimilate advanced languages more easily.\n\nGuy’s end goal in his current endeavour was to develop a method to create spells similar to the way Scratch worked. He already had “blocks” that performed actions, and blocks that were sources. He wanted to figure out a way to efficiently put these together and still have a functioning spell.\n\nBased on his observations, the spells had to have a circular construction to work. He didn’t know if it was a strict requirement, but it was a plausible conclusion given the lack of spells that suggested otherwise.\n\nSo in his experiments, he started with a large circle. Next, he began to fill in the circle with the components for a simple spell that compressed air and rotated it into a ball in the palm of his hands.\n\nHe first placed the components in a symmetric pattern inside the circle. He then tried to activate the spell, but it failed to even initiate. It was a complete dud.\n\nAfter pondering on it for a bit, Guy hypothesised that a specific ordering was required. Just placing the components didn’t provide a proper sequence for the components to activate. It didn’t make sense for air to compress before actually sourcing it.\n\nAnd so, he connected the components using straight lines and achieved some success. Although a ball formed in his hand. It was unstable. It would frequently flicker and would disperse intermittently.\n\nAfter activating the spell a few more times, Guy found out that the result was because of a sudden interruption in the influx of mana. Compared to published spells, this construct would often sputter. If the spell construct was equated to a long and winding length of tubing, it was as if there were sudden knots in between causing the water pressure to build up and disperse irregularly.\n\nGuy wasn’t knowledgeable enough to figure out the nitty-gritty details of the whole spell casting process. His current methodology was purely led by his preconceived logic and concepts. So after getting stuck at such a critical juncture, he began to push his mind to come up with a suitable solution.\n\n“The components work. The spell circle works. Then what is causing the mana flow to choke? It most likely has to do with the interconnects between the components…”\n\nAs he spoke out loud, Guy was struck by a sudden thought! “Is it because the connections aren’t closed?”\n\nThis idea sprouted from his understanding of modern electrical circuits. Guy equated the spell components as electrical components in a circuit, mana as current, and mage as the energy source. With that analogy, it made sense to him that the lines which connected the components must form a closed-circuit. The existing set-up left everything open; there wasn’t a line joining the last component with the first component.\n\nWith that in mind, Guy redrew the spell circle. Before placing the components, Guy drew a star with the same number of corners as the number of components being placed. When drawing it, he never lifted his writing utensil; it was drawing in a single line. He then placed the components on the heads of the star and activated the spell.\n\nEureka! It worked!\n\nGuy congratulated himself and performed an impromptu dance solo in the confines of his RoK.\n\nAfter a quick 5-minute dance break, Guy calmed himself and started to create a |Fireball| spell using his newly developed method.\n\nBut Guy faced a roadblock. In nearly all the Source Components, there were fragments of Ancient Tongue that provided targeting. If Guy wanted to source oxygen from the air, he would need to include it in the Source Component. But the problem was he didn’t know what oxygen was called in Ancient Tongue as it was a dead language.\n\n\"What to do now?\" Guy muttered solemnly.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-016]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":204,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 014 - Giving Up","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n“Look it’s that squib again. Why’s he wasting his time?”\n\n“Heh! People should know when to give up.”\n\nDuring the past three weeks of the semester, Markus would punctually arrive at the public practising grounds at 7 am and would diligently run through a list of spells provided by Teacher Larks.\n\nOver time, he had grown numb to the jeering remarks his so-called peers would throw his way. They’d call him a squib. A waste of time. A stray. Sometimes they’d get creative and direct their insults to his deceased family.\n\nHe didn’t know why they did these things. What had he done to deserve this? That’s when he realised that this was how the world worked. Only those with power were allowed to hold any ambition. What’s the use of dedication?\n\nIn the beginning, Markus had a drive. That one day he’d grow, and rise above his “peers”. But with every failure, his drive was punctured, until it reached the state it was in right now.\n\nMeeting Teacher Larks, and studying under him gave Markus a way out of the mire. Teacher Larks’ unorthodox views thawed into Markus’ jaded heart. He felt for the first time that his diligence wouldn’t go to waste. He realised that not everyone saw the world as an unforgiving jungle.\n\nThe first week under Teacher Larks’ tutelage, Markus worked in overdrive. Whenever he was given a new spell to try out, he’d try casting it again and again. In the end, he went through over 30 different spells, without success.\n\n‘No matter,’ he told himself. ‘Teacher is still searching for more options.’\n\nThe second week was approached with less enthusiasm, but it was equally bright for Markus. This time, he went through 15 spells, without success.\n\nIt wasn’t that he was unable to cast them. He could very easily form the circle with his will, but when he activated it by feeding it mana, it would simply collapse with an inaudible poof.\n\nNear the end of the second week, the insults and remarks that were directed his way, which he had initially tuned out, started to resonate inside him again.\n\n‘Did I raise my hopes for nothing?’ He questioned. ‘No. There’s still more, there has to be a solution!’\n\nThe third week was catastrophic. He practically ran through a single spell every day, only to face utter disappointment by seeing the circle poof before him.\n\n‘That’s it!’ Markus exclaimed internally. ‘I give up!’\n\nAnd he marched back towards the library. He ran through a speech in his mind. He would first apologise to Teacher Larks. He would then thank Teacher Larks for the efforts. He would then go to the administrative department and drop out. Markus was physically and emotionally drained.\n\nWith firm resolve, Markus stepped into the library. He knew where Teacher Larks usually set up shop and made his way there with long and confident strides.\n\nBut just as he approached the shelf before his teacher’s spot, he overheard a conversation.\n\n“You’ve looked through all the books Guy. There is no solution. There is nothing you can do. That child Markus just isn’t meant to walk the mage’s path.”\n\nThat voice belonged to the librarian, Al Jeeves. Markus was acquainted with him. Mr. Jeeves usually never paid attention to the students that came and went, unless they caused trouble or caused a ruckus. But after Teacher Larks built a nest of books and metaphorically settled into the library, Mr. Jeeves and his teacher had built an informal relationship. After that, Mr. Jeeves would always offer words of encouragement to Markus. Sometimes he’d even give him some of his delicious home-cooked meals.\n\nMarkus slowly inched closer to the shelf and pushed his ears closer. He heard his teacher’s reply, “I get what you’re saying Mr. Jeeves. But it isn’t fair.”\n\nMarkus sighed, but he quickly covered his mouth. He didn’t want to interrupt.\n\n“If we follow the orthodox logic, then only the people talented enough to walk the mage’s path are worthy to be invested in. Those that don’t have the inherent talent should resign themselves to their lives.  \nBut what about those that don’t want to resign themselves to their fates? Is it right for us, as teachers to tell them to just give up? Tell them that ‘life just isn’t fair, deal with it!’?”\n\nThere was a long pause, after which his teacher continued, “If the student is unwilling, then as a teacher it is my job to support him all the way, Al. I promised Markus that I would find a way for him to advance, and I don’t plan to give up.”\n\nMarkus could feel his nose itch as tears started to flow from his eyes. He felt inadequate. Here he was, ready to give up and throw in the towel, while his teacher was giving it his all.\n\nMarkus was ashamed. He quickly turned and ran out from the library. His emotions were in turmoil, and he felt that he was going to bawl.\n\nWith great effort, Markus suppressed his emotions and returned to the public practising grounds. He had regained his frame of mind from three weeks ago. He would never give up. Not until his teacher decided to do so. Someone was willing to believe in him, and that was sufficient!\n\nThe other students at the grounds were disdainful when they saw Markus leave. They felt that he was simply wasting time. He clearly had no future, why was he putting in so much effort? To them, his very presence and unbending attitude were sufficient to receive their scorn. His failures made them feel superior, and so they vented on him. Little did they know that if Markus left, the next one on the spotlight would be one of them. It was an unending cycle of violence and trauma.\n\nMarkus didn’t give any of that his attention. He began his routine.\n\nWith new vigour, he even revisited some of the older spells to see if he could implement any changes in the way he cast the spells. Maybe feeding mana more slowly would work? No? What if he activated it in pulses? Not that either? No matter, there are many more possibilities.\n\nHe kept going, all the way till sunset. As the sky gained a vibrant red hue, the students at the grounds started to vacate. He was the only one left. He was going to continue for another half an hour and call it a day.\n\nJust as he was about to cast a spell, he heard a familiar voice calling his name!\n\n“Markus! I did it!”\n\nA man with an excited smile plastered across his face, with his eyes bulging in his sockets, was running towards him.\n\nIt was his teacher!\n\n____\n\nGuy had completely transferred all the spells constructs into his computer and programmed a simple image recognition and decomposition algorithm that ran through the contents in a folder.\n\nHe was currently focusing on fire-based spells since he felt they’d be easier for him to visualise and draw comparisons.\n\nAs the algorithm ran, it would copy snippets from those spells into folders in a different location and categorise them with labels indicating which spell they came from. The algorithm also added a cross-reference to the original image, so he could check out the context of the spell. This was in case there were dependencies, and the shape required another one to run.\n\nWith Mast roiding up Guy's dingy last generation laptop, the algorithm finished running almost instantaneously. Guy was awestruck by the efficiency of this computer.\n\n‘If only I had something like this back in my world,’ he lamented. His old laptop had travelled the world with him. And inevitably, it had become a shadow of its former self. Even starting it up was a monumental effort.\n\nGuy recollected a fragmented memory from his past when he tried to run a Bill Nye the Science Guy video from his computer, only to have it loop at the theme song, \"Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill!\"\n\nHe shook the thought immediately. He didn't want the song to get stuck in his head again!\n\nAnd so he began to peruse the decomposed images. As he opened the directory holding all the folders, he was assaulted by a truckload of data.\n\n‘Oh Shit! That’s a lot!’\n\nThere were innumerable distinctive shapes within the spells he fed into the algorithm. Guy realised that this brute force strategy may not be as efficient as he had thought.\n\nGuy was thankful that he was currently inside his consciousness. He feared that if he saw this sight in real life, he would have sweated through his outfit.\n\nRather than waste any more time, he started to come up with a more efficient strategy to tackle this problem. It wouldn’t make sense to go through each and every single geometric shape that the algorithm flagged. There were no guarantees that the shapes had any substance to them, for all he knew they could be random figures with no purpose.\n\nInstead, it would make more sense to start with the component shapes that were most common between the spell constructs. Logically, all the fire-based spells should contain some base structures that defined them. If he had surmised correctly, Guy theorised that these archetypical shapes would become the boilerplate template that formed every fire spell in existence.\n\nWith that in mind, Guy changed the sorting parameter from alphabetical order to frequency and saw the folders rearrange themselves before him in real-time.\n\nGuy exhaled to calm himself down and psyched himself up. ‘It’s OK! You can do this Guy!’\n\nHe opened up the top-most folder and viewed the component shapes stored within.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-015]]\n","n":0.025}}},{"i":205,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 013 - A New Solution","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\nAfter entering the RoK, Guy was now face-to-face with Mast’s avatar. With an irritated growl, Guy started to vent his frustrations. \n\n‘Why can’t you help me? You saw how hard I worked the past 3 weeks. I accomplished diddly-squat!’ Guy complained.\n\n(It’s not that I am unwilling to help you. While you were busy, I looked around for possible solutions myself. But you see, there aren’t any existing solutions in this world to your problem,) Mast soothed Guy.\n\nGuy’s eyebrows furrowed. He probed, ‘But aren’t you like a god? Can’t you figure out a new method?’\n\nMast sighed as he replied, (World builders cannot innovate. Creativity and inventiveness are not within our capacity.)\n\n‘But you made the world I came from.’\n\nMast nodded, (If we’re talking semantics, then I didn’t make that world I birthed it.)\n\nGuy was a little confused about the underlying meaning of that sentence, “What’s the difference? birthing the world, making the world, they both sound the same to me.”\n\nMast hummed as he thought of a suitable reply. (Think of it this way. Let’s say my world is a tree. If I made the tree, that would mean one minute there was no tree, and the next minute there was a tree. Everything about the tree is known to me and controllable by me down to the tiniest of detail. In the future, I can change the tree whenever I want. On the other hand, if I birthed the tree, I simply planted the seeds for the tree and let it develop naturally. While I know all the tiny nuances of the tree's genetics, I cannot change it at a snap.)\n\n‘So it’s like you wrote the basic code for your world, and you let it grow naturally?’ Guy said to confirm his understanding.\n\nMast smiled and nodded, (That’s the gist of it. World builders program the laws and truths of their worlds, and the world does the rest by itself. I don’t control anything. However, what the inhabitants of my world create or develop, will naturally become available to the world builders themselves. In fact, in the past few weeks, I’ve been using a back door in this world to access the knowledge developed here. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anything of help…)\n\nGuy started to walk around the RoK as he pondered on the revelation.\n\nAs he strolled through the rows of shelves, he commented, ‘Damm. So there’s really nothing I can do huh? Well, at least I tried everything…’\n\nMast interrupted Guy, (Not everything), and pointed towards the previously locked section of the RoK, which held books from Guy’s original world.\n\nGuy raised his eyebrows while inquiring, ‘What use are those book? They are related to my old world right?’\n\nMast affirmed in response, (They are indeed related to the rules from my world. But the programming for this world is actually much closer to mine than you realise. The only difference is the existence of mana. To be honest, I don’t understand how elder brother managed to include such a cheat without causing his world to collapse. The amount of contradictions mana introduces to some of the interactions between the laws and rules of this world are unbelievable.)\n\nGuy exhaled in amusement as he gently picked up one of the books from the shelf.\n\n‘Mast, how close were we to the rules and laws that you programmed into your world?’\n\nMast laughed as he replied, (If I’m being optimistic, I’d say barely 5%.)\n\nGuy choked on his saliva, or at least his consciousness did. ‘Only 5%?!’\n\n(Come on now! You humans barely left your planet. Most of the rules and laws you formulated to describe my world were only half-baked. Given the rate at which you humans were progressing, I’d say maybe in 1000 years you all would have figured out maybe 10% of the rules of my world. But after that, things would become exponentially more difficult as some of the laws are interconnected. Ha! The %#*#% species were further ahead of you guys in that regard.)\n\nGuy’s eyes narrowed, ‘%#*#%? Who are they?’\n\nMast coughed, (They're an alien species. No point going into it now since you aren’t in my world anymore…)\n\nGuy gave Mast the stink-eye as he returned to reading the book in his hand. It was a science textbook at the elementary school level. Its contents were highly simplified and went into the core concepts that the more advanced theories were built upon.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages and immersed himself in some nostalgic thoughts, a drastic thought flashed across his mind.\n\n‘Wait a minute, let me get this straight! If we were to remove the existence of mana from this world, are you saying that it would be the same as your world?’\n\nMast nodded.\n\n‘Then what does mana do?’\n\n(I don’t want to get into too much detail because I don’t think you will understand it. Mana in the most general sense acts as an exception clause. You know that gravity pulls masses towards each other, but with mana, it is possible to introduce exceptions to this rule. There are many ways to implement these exceptions, magic spells are one of them.)\n\nGuy’s eyes widened, ‘That really is a cheat!’\n\nMast snickered, (I know what you mean. But after double-checking the programming, there are some parameters concerning mana that ensures that the world remains stable. For one thing, some rules and laws are more important than others. The law of gravity supersedes some piddly law like convection. So the amount of mana required to create an exception is proportional to the significance of the laws being undermined. \nFurthermore, while mana can be influenced through some natural phenomena, a sentient will is important to manifest it. That is why the cultivation methods in this world augment the mage’s will. By gaining insights and increasing their resonance with the natural mana, mages gain a better understanding of the myriad of ways in which mana can be used to circumvent natural laws. For higher-level mages, this becomes as easy as breathing.)\n\nGuy resolutely closed the book in his hand as he asked one final question, ‘Compared to humans from my world, how close are the sentient species in this world to understanding the natural rules and laws, excluding mana of course?’\n\nMast replied, (Less than 1%. The existence of mana makes it inherently more difficult to pinpoint the natural laws. With all the exceptions, the theories developed are extremely flimsy and filled with contradiction. And I would also add that the 1% cap is kind of flat across the board. Unlike in my world, the alien species here haven’t breached beyond certain bottlenecks.)\n\n‘I know what to do!’ Guy declared.\n\nGuy returned to the center of the RoK and began to filter out the shelves according to a set of search parameters. In the end, only the books on circle-based spells and ritual formation remained.\n\nGuy pick up several books off of the shelves and laid them open on the floor. He turned the pages to the spells pertaining to the fire element such as |Fireball|, |Flamestrike|, and |Fire-Whip|, as well as and ritual formations that included fire element such as |Fire Infusion Array|, |Burning Field|, and |Fire Strike|.\n\nStanding amidst the open books, Guy started to scan the magic circles and the formations.\n\nMast slowly approached Guy, who looked both excited and stressed at the same time.\n\n(What are you looking for?)\n\nGuy thought for a while, and answered, ‘I’m looking for similarities and patterns.’\n\nMast was a little confused, (Why?)\n\n‘My hypothesis is that since mana and magic are used to introduce exceptions in the natural laws, the spells themselves must contain similarities that correspond to those instructions that apply these exceptions,’ Guy explained.\n\nMast nodded in affirmation, but retorted, (If that’s the case, then I don’t think this will work. As you can see -) he spread his arms to encompass all the books in the library, (-there is way too much content to go through. It will take ages.)\n\nGuy smiled wryly at that realisation. But then he proposed, 'Is it possible to turn the RoK into something like a time-dilution chamber. So that time moves much faster in here, than outside?’\n\nMast shook his head and replied, (I cannot mess with the flow of time. It is one of the laws that supersedes everything else. If I was to turn this into a time-dilution chamber, then my brother would no immediately.)\n\nGuy collapsed into a squat and hugged his knees, 'What then? I can't afford to waste any more time.'\n\nBut Guy quickly thought of a solution, 'Although we can't speed up time, we can speed up my productivity.'\n\nTurning to Mast, he proposed, 'Can you make it so that this computer has all the other functionalities from the PC in my world?'\n\nMast nodded and snapped his fingers, causing an explosion of particles to materialise above the computer at the centre of the RoK for a brief moment. Once the particles subsided, the computer had turned into the laptop Guy used to own in his old world.\n\n (That is possible? But it won't have access to the Internet, since that doesn't exist here.)\n\nGuy grinned and added, ‘Can you also add a high-quality and high-speed scanner that can be connected to the computer?’\n\nMast furrowed his brows and complied by snapping his fingers again. This caused a familiar machine, that had an appearance of a scanner, to materialise next to the computer.\n\nGuy sat down before the computer at the centre of the RoK and booted it up. While he began working, Guy started to explain his plan, ‘As you said, it will take ages to go through all the intricate spells and formations to isolate the specific components. There’s only so much work the human brain can do, right?\nSo what I’m going to do is to leverage the power of this computer- oh by the way, can you boost this computer’s processing power and memory the PC from my old world was pretty basic because I couldn't travel with a gargantuan monster?’\n\nMast signed and acquiesced one last time by snapping his fingers.\n\nGuy then continued his explanation, ‘So I’m going to leverage the power of this computer and run an image recognition algorithm that takes in the spells’ image and isolates similar shapes and designs. It’s pretty basic.’\n\nMast smiled as he understood Guy's intent, (That’s pretty smart.)\n\nGuy smiled gloatingly and began to scan each of the books one page at a time.\n\nMast pondered for a while and said, (Since I know what you intend to do, I think I can make it a little easier.)\n\nHe snapped his fingers, and the scanner transformed into a plain grey box.\n\nGuy nudged the machine and lifted its lid. Once opened, all he saw was an empty space.\n\n‘What does this do?’ Guy asked.\n\n(Place the book inside and close the lid.)\n\nGuy did as instructed. He opened the lid and placed the book inside. Almost immediately, a series of flashes blinked through the sides of the box, and a pop-up appeared on the computer screen.\n\n‘It scanned the entire book in one go!’ Guy exclaimed in excitement.\n\nGuy looked around the library and exhaled with vigour.\n\n‘In those other novels, the main character travels the world, collects women, slaps face, annoys young masters, and does badass shit.\nAnd here I am, digitising books.’\n\nGuy raised his fists and exclaimed, ‘Let’s do this!’\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-014]]\n","n":0.023}}},{"i":206,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 012 - Teacher's Vow","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGaige was sitting in the lotus position inside his room, staring at the book and the potion container in front of him.\n\nHe was feeling a little conflicted. Not even a moment ago, he was silently bad-mouthing Teacher Way, only to get such expensive gifts handed to him.\n\nHe knew just how expensive the Bloodline Partial-Awakening potions were. He was a little suspicious about their quality, but he couldn’t question the alchemy guild’s certification attached to the container.\n\nThe cultivation method was what threw him for a loop. After reading through it, Gaige had a good idea that it was genuine. The methods and the insights in the book were top notch! As a son from a prominent clan, he had the opportunity to observe different cultivation methods. The nameless book before him was definitely new, but it was a specialised method and was perfectly tailored for him. To a frightening degree at that.\n\nThe information in some of the pages was so personal that even Gaige was surprised. Was Teacher Way spying on him?\nGaige quickly swivelled his head in place and put on a jacket to cover his body. He then closed the curtains and double-checked the locks on the door.\n\nWith a satisfied nod, he returned to face the two items.\n\nGaige’s eyes reddened as tears threatened to burst out.\n\nAfter his failure, a lot of bad things happened one after the other. Although his father didn’t despise him, Gaige could see a hint of disappointment in his gaze. His mother, who was already averse to his presence, became even more disinclined. The worst part was that his childhood sweetheart, the person he was set to marry in the future, summarily cancelled the engagement. The emotional gut-punch turned into an unrelenting groin barrage when her family offered the marriage alliance to his elder brother.\n\nHe was thankful to Teacher Way for providing him with another opportunity. He vowed that even if the potion and the cultivation method didn’t work, he would be forever grateful to him.\n\nAnd then without a second thought, Gaige popped the stopper, brought the potion towards his lips, and drowned it with an audible gulp.\n\nAs the liquid descended his gullet, Gaige quickly returned to the lotus position and followed the instructions on the new cultivation method.\n\n‘The darkness swallows everything. It is endless and all-encompassing. To be one with darkness is to become a devourer of light…’\n\nAs he mentally chanted the mantra, he started to feel the familiar churning of mana inside his channels.\n\nWith a smile on his face, he continued. But after a while, the mana inside him started to become turbid.\n\nGaige frowned. It was happening again. He was preparing himself for the inevitable backlash. But contrary to his expectations, a new heat started to resonate from his core. It felt both scorching and soothing at the same time. It was as if a new body part was being added into his body forcefully, but it didn’t feel foreign at all.\n\nGaige scrubbed his unnecessary thoughts and continued his cultivation.\n\nThe heat in his body started to spread with the mana in his channels. Following every circulation, the heat in his core started to subside, while a cooling sensation permeated through his body.\n\nAfter a while, the instability inside Gaige started to settle. With one final circulation, everything returned to normal. Just as he opened his eyes, a surge rushed through his mana channels.\n\n‘I’m breaking into the middle stage!’ Gaige exclaimed.\n\nThe surge burst out from the pores in his body causing his body temperature to lower slightly.\n\nOnce the dust settled Gaige stood up in place, his legs shivered in excitement. \n\n'It worked!'\n\nAs he tried to circulate his mana once again, he didn’t feel any obstructions, nor did he face any irregularities. In fact, the whole process felt much easier.\n\nGaige couldn’t contain his glee and screamed out loudly, \"YES!\"\n\n“Hey! Shut UP! People are trying to sleep here!”\n\n____\n\nIt was now three weeks since Guy first started his delve into the academy’s library. Over those weeks, he had exhausted all the books accessible to him.\n\nHe first went through all the available spellbooks. He listed down the most basic spells and had Markus try casting them. Unfortunately, none of them panned out.\n\nGuy then went through the books on ritual formations. He wondered if he could boost Markus’ mana capacity, or offer any casting cost reductions. While there were some options, none of them was sufficient to offer any substantial gains. Most of the boosting ritual formations were percentage-based, and would only amplify based on the individual’s base capacity.\n\nExhausting those options, Guy apprehensively went through the books on alchemy. Guy was a little averse to this topic because he had a poor experience with toxic medications from his past life. After being pumped with deadly chemicals as part of his chemotherapy, he was a little jaded with alchemy as a whole.\n\nAccording to the literature, alchemical potions were basically poisons that offset the damages they did to the body with the massive benefits they offered. Guy would not, in good conscience, subject an average Joe like Markus to such a torturous experience.\n\nHowever, although he was reluctant, he still went through the alchemical books for any possible solutions.\n\nThere were none.\n\nFor the heck of it, Guy decided to look through the other books in the library holding on to a modicum of hope that there would be some hidden or obscure solutions. According to most of the novels he’d read, the main character always found some heavenly cheat in the last place anyone would look.\n\nBut the reality was a bitch!\n\nAll he gained from his fervent search were a bunch of books in his RoK, as well as empathetic looks from the librarian, Al Jeeves.\n\nAl Jeeves was a Core Condensation realm mage who had been working in the Academy’s library for over 50 years. In fact, he was overqualified for this position as a librarian since Al held 2-star licences in alchemy, painting and sculpting, smithing and runecrafting, cooking, as well as herbology. With such a foundation, earning a 2-star teaching licence or higher would have been a piece of cake. But Al didn’t pursue that path and had settled after gaining the 1-star licence.\n\nHis main goal was to keep learning since his cultivation method was built upon the foundation of increasing one’s knowledge. After realising that teaching and pushing his cultivation forward would conflict against each other, he decided to focus on the latter.\n\nHe was a highly renowned figure in Radiant City as well as the Solar Empire. He chose to settle in Radiant Academy because he wanted to work towards a beast-taming 2-star licence. Radiant City was close to Green-Sky Forest, which was home to a myriad of beasts - some that were rumoured to be in the Tesseract Formation realm, which was a realm higher than Core Condensation.\n\nThe closeness to such an abundant resource had sling-shotted the beast-taming guild’s achievements in the city. Thus Radiant City became the unofficial Mecca for beast-tamers in the Solar Empire.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Al and Guy had gotten really close. After observing the diligence with which Guy researched for his student, Al was greatly moved and did his best in helping Guy in his efforts.\n\nEvery evening, when Guy left the library, the old librarian would offer some consoling words and take him out for dinner. Before they parted ways, Al would always gently urge Guy to give up.\n\nNoticing the exhausted Guy slouched over a book, Al slowly approached him and patted his back.\n\n“Come on now, Guy. You’ve looked through everything. There’s nothing that you can do to help your student,” he said gently.\n\n“Ah! Mr. Jeeves.” Guy jolted up and rubbed his eyes.\n\nWith furrowed brows, Al handed Guy a cup of hot beverage. “Here, drink some of this!”\n\n“Thank you for this, I really needed a pick me up!” Guy commented.\n\nAs Guy slowly drank the beverage, Al pulled over a seat and sat near him.\n\n“You’ve looked through all the books Guy. There is no solution. There is nothing you can do. That child Markus just isn’t meant to walk the mage’s path,” Al said while consoling Guy.\n\nGuy carefully placed down the empty cup and smiled. “I get what you’re saying Mr. Jeeves. But it isn’t fair.”\n\nAl’s ears twitched and his eyes darted to a spot directly behind Guy. But he quickly lowered his vigilance after confirming something.\n\nGuy turned his seat to face Al and continued, “If we follow orthodox logic, then only the people talented enough to walk the mage’s path are worthy to be invested in. Those that don’t have the inherent talent should resign themselves to their lives.  \nBut what about those that don’t want to resign themselves to their fates? Is it right for us, as teachers to tell them to just give up? Tell them that ‘life just isn’t fair, deal with it!’?”\n\nGuy’s gaze turned serious as he declared confidently, “If the student is unwilling, then as a teacher it is my job to support them all the way. I promised Markus that I would find a way for him to advance, and I don’t plan to give up.”\n\nAl smiled wryly while shaking his head. As he stood up to leave, he added, “Well, good luck. I’ll keep an eye out for any good literature. Just don’t exhaust yourself Guy…”\n\nGuy was a little conflicted himself. He spoke all righteously and confidently, but deep down he was extremely burnt-out. He had essentially wasted 3 weeks!\n\nWith a long and dejected sign, Guy decided to turn towards Mast.\n\n‘Mast. Can you help a brother out?’ Guy asked with a hint of expectation.\n\n(I… can’t,) Mast replied.\n[[\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-013]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":207,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 011 - Wei Zao the 1-star Alchemist","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\nTo partially awaken the Abyssal Wyrm’s bloodline within Gaige. The most optimal strategy would be to brew a Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion with an Abyssal Wyrm’s vitality base. These vitality bases could be in any form as long as they held the bloodline's fragment.\n\nInitially, Wei Zao was planning to source out an Abyssal Wyrm scale, even a tiny sliver of it. But finding an Abyssal Demon nail shaving caused him to completely change his initial plan.\n\nIn his Omniscient Library, there was a recipe for the Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion listed under Gaige’s information. This recipe was formed once Wei Zao assimilated the books from the academy and the alchemy guild. As soon as he touched the Abyssal Demon nail shavings, the recipe updated and another variation was provided. The only difference was that this new recipe was a little volatile and utilised a lot more ingredients to mould the vitality fragment in the nail shavings to fit the Abyssal Wyrm’s bloodline.\n\nAs he scanned through the list of ingredients, Wei Zao was a little relieved. All of them were readily available in this storage facility. Furthermore, with the highly detailed instructions, Wei Zao was confident that he could brew the potion. The best part was that he wouldn’t even have to shell out any money. This was a double whammy!\n\nWithout wasting any more time. Wei Zao carefully collected all the required ingredients and moved towards the testing hall.\n\nBeyn and Eida decided to monitor the test as well. Eida was a little resigned at the new developments. She didn’t expect Wei Zao to pull such a stunt. In fact, she too was kind of looking forward to gaining a promising apprentice. But after the recent fuss, she wrote Wei Zao off. The man wasn't worth the trouble.\n\nBeyn was simply there to watch an interesting spectacle unfold. \n\nUnexpectedly, he saw the subject in question walk in with a hodgepodge of ingredients. Beyn nearly lost his shit right there! What the hell was the man doing?\n\nSilently, Beyn prepared his retardant talismans for a possible catastrophe. Alchemist Rao was practically sweating a river at that sight. But he chose to keep quiet as the manager hadn’t said anything yet.\n\nOnce all the candidates were prepared, alchemist Rao signalled the start of the test.\n\nBeyn had his focus completely on Wei Zao. He wanted to see what the man was going to do and be ready to respond to any dangers at a moments notice. He was not going to have the guild building collapse under his watch!\n\nThe first thing Beyn saw was the young man staring out into space blankly. Beyn was slowly growing impatient. It was almost as if he was watching a ticking time bomb.\n\n‘Move, damn it!’ Beyn cursed inwardly.\n\nAlmost on queue, Wei Zao slipped out of the trance and started working with a firm expression. First, he lit up the burner under the standard brewing crucible. Most training crucible nowadays had a magic apparatus that read the temperature inside them. Gone were the days of alchemists eyeballing the conditions of their crucibles.\n\nAs the crucible was heating up, Wei Zao filled it up with distilled water based on the amount listed on the recipe.\n\nWatching the man work, Beyn was a little assuaged.\n\n‘At least he is being a little methodical and not throwing all the ingredients inside at once.’\n\nBut Beyn couldn’t finish that thought. Because not a second after the water reached boiling point, Wei Zao unceremoniously tossed three-quarters of the ingredients on his side into the crucible.\n\nBeyn’s words were stuck in his throat. He was prepared to evacuate the testing room. He saw the crucible shake violently, it was a sign of an imminent explosion.\n\nBracing for impact Beyn circulated the mana inside his body and reinforced his muscles. He then started chanting an impromptu warding spell to protect Eida and his colleague.\n\nRight before the crucible reached the point of no return, Wei Zao added the rest of the ingredients barring the Abyssal Demon nail shavings.\n\nAs the newly added ingredients entered the mix, the vibrating crucible stopped shaking, until it reached a standstill.\n\nIt was at that moment that Beyn realised what had happened. He started to recollect the list of ingredients the man brought with him and the entire process. The ingredients were clearly for a Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion as well as a vitality cleansing and reconstructing catalyst. Noticing the Abyssal Demon nail shavings remaining on the table, the complete picture dawned in Beyn’s mind and he involuntarily exclaimed, “He’s forging a Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion for a darkness aligned bloodline!”\n\nEida and alchemist Rao turned their heads in surprise.\n\n“But that’s a peak 1-star potion!” Eida added.\n\nAlchemist Rao nodded in agreement. He reassessed the blasé young man’s earlier actions.\n\n“He definitely has a strong foundation. But I think his brewing technique is a little mechanical,” Rao commented.\n\n“It’s obvious that he hasn’t brewed this potion before. Actually, the way he is handling the crucible and the other equipment indicates that he probably hasn’t brewed many potions either,” Beyn nodded in agreement.\n\nWith a final flourish, Wei Zao added the shavings and doubled the heat. Slowly, the liquid in the crucible started evaporating. After a measured minute and a half, Wei Zao extinguished the burner and allowed the concoction to settle.\n\nOnce the fluid cooled down to a handleable temperature, Wei Zao retrieved four containers with stoppers and carefully poured the potion into them.\n\n“Such a high yield! Alchemist Rao, once this is finished, I want you to go and take note of the ingredients the young man used. There were a few new combinations I have never seen before. The brewing method was fairly basic, so I guess that those new combinations somehow increased the yield,” Beyn pointed out.\n\nWei Zao collapsed onto the seat next to him and started to inspect the potions. The Omniscient Library provided an evaluation on them. Only one out of the four gained a high rating, while the other three were only satisfactory. Wei Zao sighed in relief and carefully closed the stoppers.\n\nHe then approached the examiners.\n\nHe said, “I’ve brewed a Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion for the Abyssal Wyrm bloodline. Please take a look,” and handed the four containers.\n\nThe three alchemists carefully opened each container and inspected the potion inside. Alchemist Rao and Beyn were more knowledgeable than Eida in this matter and were able to immediately discern the quality of the potions following a cursory evaluation. Eida performed a series of tests to determine the efficacy and potency of the potions, and she too was surprised after the fact.\n\n“Such a wonderful concoction. All of them are of good quality. But this one in particular is perfect. Young man, you could earn a fortune with this one if you auction it!” Alchemist Rao exclaimed.\n\n“Wonderful! Marvellous! I know this goes against protocol, but congratulations on gaining a 1-star licence, Alchemist Way,” Beyn added.\n\n“Would you like to sell them through our guild? You will receive 90% of the profits from your sales?” Beyn asked.\n\nWei Zao was a little shaken by the fact that he could earn a fortune with the sale of the high-quality potion. He was extremely tempted to do it, but he remembered his original purpose. And so he replied, “Apart from the perfect potion, I would like to sell the rest.”\n\nEida sent over a questioning gaze.\n\n“You see, my original intention to enrol into the Alchemy guild was to get a Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion for my student,” He added.\n\nThe faces of the three alchemists softened when they heard Wei Zao's full explanation and purpose in pursuing an alchemy license.\n\n“I am envious of your student for having such a diligent and caring teacher,” Beyn commented in admiration.\n\nAlchemist Rao said, “Yes. Back when I was a student in the Radiant Academy, my teacher never even looked at me. My aptitude in cultivation was quite poor, my strengths lay in alchemy. But he didn't even bother to evaluate my potential properly.”\n\nBeyn carefully packaged the perfect-quality potion and handed it over to Wei Zao. While doing so, Beyn said, “Come over tomorrow to get your official 1-star certification. Once you have it, you will be recognised in any of the alchemy guild branches across the world. And if you have any problems or queries, make sure to ask my daughter Eida here. She is also a 1-star alchemist who is about to take the 2-star certification test. I saw that you are lacking experience in brewing. Don’t hesitate to ask her for guidance, I have taught her everything personally.”\n\nWei Zao turned to Eida and flashed a bright smile and bowed. “Then I will be in your guidance ma’am.”\n\nEida blushed and waved her hand.\n\nSince Wei Zao had accomplished his goal, and that too in a single day, he was in an uplifted mood.\n\nWhen he exited the building, he saw that the sun was nearly setting.\n\n‘I guess Gaige’s probably back at his dorm.’\n\nHe then started to make his way into the student’s quarters.\n\nGaige had called it an early day and was in his room trying to cultivate. Even after failing continuously, Gaige was tenacious and refused to give up. \n\nTeacher Way had said that he would find a way to help him out. In the beginning, Gaige was excited. Wei Zao even said that he had an Abyssal Wyrm’s bloodline. Although he was sceptical, the details Wei Zao went into during the recruitment were too convincing as a lot of the symptoms he described, even some obscure ones that popped up near his genitals, matched up. \n\nBut after asking around, he found that teaching apprentice Jo Way was an infamous figure for messing up a student’s cultivation.\n\nThat key fact caused Gaige to rethink his decisions. He was tempted to drop out of Wei Zao’s tutelage, but he decided to hold out.\n\nGaige had a strong sense of righteousness. Ever since a young age, he just couldn’t take it when someone was being wronged. He was holding out to see whether the rumours on Wei Zao were true. If the “help” his teacher provided was crooked in any way, Gaige was prepared to report him to the management and have him fired.\n\nWhile Gaige was contemplating on his next plan of action, a series of knocks interrupted his thoughts.\n\n‘Who could it be at this time?’ Gaige scratched his head.\n\nAs if answering his doubts, Wei Zao’s voice resounded from the other side, “Gaige! It’s me! Teacher Way.”\n\nGaige opened the door. He wanted to ask Teacher Way why he was visiting him so late. But he didn’t get an opportunity to voice it out, as the other man quickly shoved two items into Gaige’s empty arms.\n\nWei Zao then rattled out a series of instructions, “That right there is a cultivation method aligned to your specific constitution. And this is a Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion for the Abyssal Wyrm bloodline. Drink the potion and practice this cultivation method. Don’t go back to your old one, that will cause irreversibly harm to you. Once you’ve done that, meet me tomorrow at the sparring yard. Alright, so I’m gonna go,” and simply left.\n\nGaige remained standing at his doorstep with a blank look on his face.\n\n‘What the hell just happened?’\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-012]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":208,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 010 - Wei Zao the Genius","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nThe testing hall was fairly spacious. There were tables placed with around 6-feet of separation between them row- and column-wise.\n\nThe examinees started to take their seats starting from the front-most spots.\n\nEida walked up to the examiner’s table right at the front of the hall and handed out the test papers face-down to all the occupied desks.\n\nFollowing that, she waited for the clock at the front of the hall to perfectly reach the next hour and gestured for everyone to begin.\n\nThe test was an hour-long and there were 20 questions the examinees had to answer.\n\nAs Wei Zao inspected the questions, he quickly recollected where the pertaining information was located in the books inside the Omniscient Library. Cross-referencing was reasonably easy; the moment he thought of a particular search term, the library brought books related to it to the forefront.\n\nWei Zao found that nearly all the questions could be answered from the information in his Omniscient Library. So without wasting any more time, he started to write his responses.\n\nEida was observing the examinees from her desk. She saw a lot of confused expressions. Evidently, a lot of them weren’t prepared. But as her eyes fell on Wei Zao, she was surprised.\n\nThe man was happily jotting down answers one after the other. As she saw his actions, she noticed that every time he finished a question he would read the next, stared blankly at the wall for a quick moment, and then answered it unwaveringly.\n\nShe didn’t know what to think of his behaviour. She questioned whether he had already learned the basic knowledge and was purely reviewing the content back in the repository. That would make sense given how unperturbed he was in answering the questions.\n\nJust as she was about to move her gaze back to the other examinees, Wei Zao stood up from his seat. Not even half an hour had passed and he already stood up? Eida thought he was giving up after realising that some of the questions were quite complicated. She wanted to return some words of consolation but to her surprise, he said, “I would like to hand in my answer sheet.”\n\nObserving his genuinely calm smile threw Eida for a loop. Without wasting a second she snatched the sheets from his hand and flipped through them.\n\n‘He answered all the questions! And that too in one shot? There aren’t any scratches or error markings!’ She exclaimed internally.\n\nWithout even reading the answers she knew that the man before her was quite knowledgeable. It was almost impossible to bullshit such verbose answers in a short time frame. He would have to prepare them before entering the hall, and who would do something so stupid?\n\nEida calmed herself and waved for Wei Zao to leave the hall. As he walked out, the other examinees sent a myriad of gazes his way. Some were envious, others were disdainful. But Wei Zao didn’t care. He was confident in his responses, and he was already preparing for the next test.\n\nAs soon as he exited, Eida started to thoroughly read Wei Zao’s answer sheets.\n\nWith every passing line of text, her expression grew more agitated.\n\nThe answers were precise to a T. It was almost as if he copied them from a book. That was definitely not the case since the hall was lined with ritual formations that recognised any transitioning mana fluctuations. Furthermore, he couldn’t have smuggled in a book. This only meant that the man had properly memorised all this information.\n\nBreaking protocol, she started to correct the answer sheets right there. As a 1-star alchemist, she was allowed to do so, but it was usually done after all the tests were collected.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Wei Zao scored full marks. There weren’t even any spelling mistakes. It was just too perfect.\n\nEida calmed herself and waited for all the examinees to hand in their sheets. The last one handed in his sheets right at the final minute, which irked Eida a little. Mainly because he had already closed his answer sheets and was simply staring at her during the last 15 minutes.\n\nWith the answer stack in hand, Eida rushed out in a brisk walk towards the branch manager’s office.\n\nBeyn Barr was the current manager of Radiant City’s Alchemy Guild, and he was a 3-star alchemist. He was also Eida’s father.\n\nEida impatiently knocked on the door and walked in as soon as she heard an affirming hum from within.\n\n“Dad, check this out!” She said as she slid Wei Zao’s paper across Beyn’s desk.\n\nBeyn glanced at the paper. As an advanced alchemist, the test was a trivial matter for Beyn. With a cursory look, he could determine the accuracy of the answers. \n\n“Hmm. There doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it. What’s the matter?” Beyn asked with a confused gaze.\n\n“The examinee answered the paper in less than half an hour!” She exclaimed.\n\nBeyn’s raised his eyebrows. “The candidate is definitely impressive. He would be a good addition to our guild.”\n\n“I know. I was going to present him with the licence personally and possibly offer some personal tutoring. What do you think?” Eida asked in an expected tone.\n\n“That’s also a good idea! You are close to earning a 2-star licence, this could be a good opportunity to get yourself a promising apprentice. You know what? Let’s go probe him out!” Beyn commented excitedly.\n\nAs the father-daughter duo made their way through the hallways they had a spring in their steps. The success of the different guilds depended primarily on the quality of the members in them. Alchemy was a difficult and expensive profession to get into. That, in and of itself, was a steep step to sway away potential entrants. Not even the prospect of raking in a boatload of cash, later on, was sufficient to draw in more people into the profession. This was why Beyn was excited at the prospect of unearthing an alchemical genius.  Not only would it be beneficial for the branch, but it would also raise the competence of the guild as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, there was also a custom amongst alchemists to take on an apprentice once they earned 2-stars. It was a tradition put in place to raise the skill floor of the guild members, and to improve the relationship between skill tiers within the guild. Ultimately, this custom favoured the apprentices as it gave them access to a high-level contact in the guild as well as a credible source of guidance in the profession.\n\nBeyn’s second purpose in personally visiting Wei Zao was to cultivate a decent student for his daughter. She was an extremely promising seed herself, and if her student wasn’t up to the mark it would also hinder her progress.\n\nOnce the duo reached the front halls, they started to hear a commotion near one of the testing halls.\n\n“Young man you cannot take the test! You don’t have a practising licence yet!” A familiarly deep voice echoed from within, laced with a tinge of annoyance.\n\n“But Sir, I just took the test. It said on the board that I’d receive the licence within half an hour from the test. But there seems to be a delay. I expressly signed up for the 1-star test consecutively after the practising licence test because of that,” a younger masculine voice answered.\n\nBeyn turned to his daughter and saw her furrowing her brows. He guessed that the voice probably belonged to Wei Zao. They hurried their steps and arrived outside the testing hall.\n\nOutside the hall, one of the 2-star alchemists who usually handled the 1-star tests was irritatedly reprimanding Wei Zao.\n\n“First off! You just attended the practising licence test. How can you be so certain that you even passed it?”\n\n“I’m 100% confident that I passed it!” Wei Zao declared righteously.\n\nBefore the proctor could retaliate, Eida quickly interrupted and clarified, “Alchemist Rao, I procrastinated and delayed posting the marks. I actually came here to congratulate comrade Way, and present him with the practising licence.“\n\n“Alchemist Barr. It’s all well and good that he passed, but does this make sense to you? This man just attempted the first test to qualify as a practising alchemist, how do you expect me to trust him with the equipment and materials from our storage?” alchemist Rao questioned.\n\nEida smiled wryly and turned towards her father. At this point, Beyn was a little disappointed with Wei Zao’s behaviour. The man came across as extremely half-hearted. While Beyn was willing to believe that the man was a genius, to rush directly from the practising licence test to a 1-star test was asking for death. The jump in difficulty was not linear in any way. The former was fully theoretical and the latter involved practical work.\n\nAfter contemplating, Beyn spoke up. “Alchemist Rao, let the man attempt the test. If he fails he will just have to reimburse us. The materials and tools accessible in the 1-star test are replaceable.” \n\nBeyn smirked faintly. If the man wanted to show off, Beyn was willing to entertain his antics. Like his daughter, he too believed that learning by falling was the best way. Right now, the man was probably riding high after passing an easy theoretical test. Experiencing the difficulty of brewing a potion would give him a rude awakening.\n\nAgain, while Beyn didn’t wish ill of the young man. He hoped that the failure today would be a teaching moment for him about the difficulty of the occupation.\n\nWith that, alchemist Rao apprehensively led Wei Zao into the guild’s storage.\n\nWhile Wei Zao walked between the multitude of shelves, he was fascinated by the variety of interesting looking plants and ingredients. Most of them had such vibrant colours and shapes that he was completely daunted. One could never find anything like them in his old world. Some plants looked like animal parts and some animal parts looked like plants. Some fungi had a metallic appearance, and some metals sprouted like fungi.\n\nFor the 1-star test, the examinee had to brew a 1-star potion at a minimum. They could push for 2-star or above, but those were extremely tough since they involved mana infusion and other complicated techniques.\n\nAt first, Wei Zao was hoping to brew a basic revitalisation potion. After he earned the 1-star, he could gain access to the more obscure ingredients at a subsidised rate and brew the Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion for his student.\n\nBut he quickly changed his mind once he reached one of the farther shelves inside the storage room. In one of these shelves, Wei Zao found Abyssal Demon claw shavings.\n\nWei Zao’s eyes widened in shock. But they quickly gained clarity as he changed his plan of action.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-011]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":209,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 009 - Wei Zao the Serial Page Flipper","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\nWei Zao stood before the Alchemy Guild’s building. Before he took over this body, the original “Jo Way” had tried to apply for an alchemy license, only to fail miserably.\n\nThankfully this was in another city. Just thinking about the mess the original body made sent a shiver down Wei Zao’s spine.\n\nFor teachers, having a practising license in another occupation was a huge plus. Having a certification in another profession would automatically make a teacher more desirable. \n\nTeachers could be classified into tiers based on the number of teaching stars they earned. A teaching apprentice who advanced to become a teacher would have zero stars. Once a zero-star teacher earned a 1-star license in one of the many side professions in this world, they could take a certification exam with the Teaching Association to get promoted to a 1-star teacher.\n\nThe difference between a starred teacher and one without was like heaven and earth. A starred teacher could be considered a global entity not tied down to any political power. But an unstarred teacher was still beholden to the powers that operated in the area they worked in.\n\nTo move from a 1-star teacher to a 2-star teacher, the teacher in question would need to hold at least two 2-star licenses in any side occupation. This pattern followed in that manner, and the difficulty to gain more stars as a teacher rose exponentially with each step.\n\nThe highest number of teaching stars held by any teacher living or dead was 5. The number of 5-star teachers that existed in this entire world could be counted in one hand, and these entities were veritable powerhouses in the field of cultivation and magic.\n\nWith regards to side professions, the ones that offered certification had their own official guilds and associations. Unfortunately, not all side professions were ranked equally. For instance, holding a 2-star chef certificate was less sought after compared to a 2-star alchemist’s certificate.\n\nStarting in these certifiable occupations was similar to teaching, in that the person had to first take a practising test and earn a license for it.\n\nWei Zao calmly entered the guild’s building and sauntered over to the receptionist’s desk. Seated there was a beautiful young woman who was reading through a book on recognising medicinal wildflowers.\n\n“Excuse me. I’d like to apply for the practising license,” Wei Zao said to the receptionist.\n\nThe woman looked up from her book and pointed towards a bulletin board to the side where the sign-up forms were posted.\n\nWei Zao walked over and checked out the test schedules. There was a practising licence test in an hour, on top of that there was also a 1-star certification test right after. Wei Zao didn’t want to waste too much time so he decided to pick up the sign-up sheets for both the tests and walked back to the receptionist.\n\n“Excuse me, miss. Can you please tell me the general overview of the contents in the practising license and the 1-star license tests?”\n\nThe woman looked a little annoyed, but she answered nonetheless. In fact, she was only at the receptionist’s desk temporarily. The actual receptionist was taking the practising licence test and so she was temporarily holding down the fort.\n\nIn actuality, the woman was a 1-star alchemist called Eida Barr who ran the support workshops for alchemy practitioners.\n\nEida was annoyed with Wei Zao’s questions because the answers to them could be found on the display boards all around the building’s ground floor. If only the man bothered to look around him, he’d notice them. She automatically had a poor impression of this impertinent lad. But since she was technically a “receptionist” answering these trivial questions fell within the job description.\n\n“For the practising licence, the test consists of identifying common ingredients and listing their uses. It’s fairly simple. For the 1-star licence, the test involves brewing a potion or a pill that is at least 1-star in difficulty. For that, you will have supervised access to our storage. You can use all the ingredients you want, but depending on the success or failure of your attempt you will have to pay for the ingredients,” she rattled monotonously.\n\n“That sounds easy,” Wei Zao murmured, which was promptly heard by Eida.\n\n“Miss, for the tests preparations, would definitely be necessary. Is there a book repository or library that we have access to?” Wei Zao asked with an expectant gaze.\n\nNoticing the man’s excitement, Eida’s harsh assessment softened a little and she pointed him in the general direction of the public repository.\n\nWei Zao quickly walked towards the library to gauge out the number of books he’d have to go through for the tests.\n\nAfter he saw that there weren’t that many topics being assessed for the tests, he quickly signed up for the practising license test and began the process of assimilating the books into his Omniscient Library.\n\nWhat followed were a series of periodic sounds of aggressive page-turning. After “practising” back at the academy library, he was sort of an expert in this. He now used all the fingers in his hand while turning the pages. That saved a lot of time!\n\nWhile he was doing this, Eida happened to enter the repository to give him some advice in case he needed it. Most budding alchemists couldn’t make heads or tails of how to start their journey, and it was her role to help them out.\n\nBut as she neared the repository, he heard loud noises echoing from within. It sounded similar to someone venting their frustrations on books. She quickly rushed in to make sure nothing was wrong, and she was welcomed with a sight of a man quickly pulling out books and swiping through them like a madman.\n\nAlthough she was greatly angered by the callousness in the way Wei Zao handled these precious books, she was kind of impressed by how he got the whole process down to a science. If she didn’t know any better, it looked almost as if he had practised this many times before.\n\nShe quickly shook that stupid idea out of her head and tapped on Wei Zao’s shoulders.\n\n“Excuse me. Is there a problem? Can I help you in finding what you’re looking for?” Eida calculated her words.\n\nWei Zao put on an amicable smile and answered, “No thanks. I’m just memorising the contents.”\n\nEida’s brows collapsed into her eyes, and her skull threatened to swallow them whole.\n\n‘Who the hell memorises by rapidly shuffling through the pages?’ She questioned internally.\n\nEither she was an idiot all this time for reading books slowly and this man was a genius of immeasurable proportions, or that this asshole was trying to act overconfident and putting on a show.\n\nAs a human being that firmly believed in logic, she was leaning towards the latter explanation. \n\nShe exhaled out a long sigh and decided to let the man continue with his charade. Before she left she made sure to point out that the books in the repository were expensive and that he should practise caution when handling them.\n\nAnd with that Wei Zao returned to his leisurely page-turning. \n\nThere was still a little less than half an hour left to the practising licence test, and he was nearly finished with scanning all the books in the repository.\n\nOf those available to the public, only a few handfuls were required for the practising licence. The contents of those books mainly pertained to safety procedures, basic skills, and foundational theories. The remainder were for the aspiring 1-star alchemists and included more advanced topics more geared towards application and brewing.\n\nBy the time he finished accumulating all the books, there was still 10 minutes left. Wei Zao quickly looked through the contents in his Omniscient Library and found that similar to the books on cultivation methods, the potion brewing recipes were also edited. However, unlike with the cultivation methods, the number of additions to the recipes were staggering. They went into so much detail that even a complete layman would be able to follow them. Wei Zao was feeling confident, so before going towards the testing hall, he decided to submit the 1-star license test sign-up form along the way.\n\nJust as he arrived outside the testing hall, a representative walked over with the list of applicants. Coincidentally, the representative happened to be Eida. Wei Zao was pleasantly surprised as he had a good opinion of the well-meaning woman. \n\nEida looked through the sheets in her hands and called out the names of the examinees, indicating for them to enter the hall. For the test today there weren’t many applicants - only 6.\n\nWhen she called out the final name, she looked up and saw a familiar face.\n\n“You? Didn’t you just start looking through the examination contents?” She asked in shock.\n\nWei Zao nodded his head and tried to assuage her worries. “I did. But don’t worry ma’am, I’ve memorised it all.”\n\nEida was still not convinced and so she tried to issue a subtle warning. “Well, I can’t stop you. But just know that you only get three opportunities to take the practising licence test. And you have to wait for at least 5 years before attempting it again.”\n\nTo be honest, Eida didn’t care about the man. Even though she was the same age as him, she had already seen many kinds of people walking through the building’s halls. And while he was respectable, she felt that the man was acting a little too callous.\n\nShe had to work tirelessly to earn her 1-star licence and while she didn’t wish ill for him, she hoped that his failure today would be a teaching moment for him about the difficulty of her occupation.\n\nSeeing as Wei Zao was adamant about taking the test, she decided to not push any further and gestured him to enter.\n\nShe had washed her hands of the responsibility after issuing that previous warning. If anything were to happen in the future, she wouldn’t be held liable.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-010]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":210,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 008 - Wei Zao the Transmigrator","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nWei Zao died while reading a book and got transmigrated into another world. He didn't even bother asking the important questions such as: \n\nHow did I die?\n\nWhy am I here?\n\nInstead, he just went with it.  It was a second chance for him after all. His dead-end job as a librarian wasn’t taking him anywhere.\n\nThe world he was brought into was one filled with magic. There existed something known as mana in the environment, that people known as mages could use to do extraordinary things. \n\nIt was all very daunting. But the deity that brought him to this world offered to give him a system. Something that could support him in this world.\n\nSince he spent most of his past life in the library as part of his job, the first thought that came into his mind was to have a library that could give him the answer to anything.\n\nFor the diety, this wasn’t a hard task to accomplish. And thus started his adventure in this new world, with his Omniscient Library System.\n“Jo! Wait for me! I have some more things I want to discuss!”\n\nA sweet voice echoed from behind him\n\nWei Zao hurried his steps to add distance between himself and the woman chasing him.\n\n‘Damn it! Why is this woman trying to find trouble with me?’\n\nBut no matter how hard he tried, Wei Zao just couldn’t outrun a mage just on the cusp of breaking into Foundation Establishment.\n\n“Jo, why don’t we continue our discussion over lunch,” Mai declared matter-of-factly.\n\nWei Zao’s eyes twitched when he heard her tone of voice.\n\n‘It’s like she’s doing me a favour.’ But of course, he didn’t voice that thought out loud.\n\n“No thanks. I have better things to do,” Wei Zao replied and turned to leave.\n\nMai stood in place, stumped. For someone who was used to getting her way most of the time, this was her first rejection, and that too from someone that she considered beneath her.\n\nShe snorted in derision, ‘He probably got lucky and remembered the contents of that book. I’ll get you another time.’\n\n\nBut Wei Zao had already erased that whole interaction from his mind. His main goal in visiting the library was to accumulate more technical knowledge from this world to find a solution for his student’s problem. Although he asked the deity to provide him with a system that could answer all of his information, it seemed that it was incomplete.\n\n‘System why aren’t all the book already inside the Omniscient Library? Should omniscient mean to know everything?’ Wei Zao asked in an annoyed tone.\n\n{To have everything from the get-go can become overwhelming. It is safer for your sanity if only the pertinent information is available at the required time.}\n\nWei Zao sighed. ‘But why do I have to scan through the entire book before getting it inside the library? Why can’t I get it copied by just touching the book?’\n\n{There is a saying to never judge a book by its cover. It is possible for the contents of the book to be completely different from what is written on the cover.}\n\n‘Stupid system, you’re just making my life harder aren’t you?’ Wei Zao chided.\n\n{…}\n\nAn interesting feature Wei Zao discovered in his library was its ability to correct any errors in texts. For instance, Wei Zao knew of the typo in the book Mai brought up way before he even reached the afterword because the library highlighted the text and provided a correction for it.\n\n‘In that sense, I guess you are omniscient. Fake news is dangerous after all.’\n\nWei Zao’s first student, Gaige Bori had a latent draconic bloodline. In this world, humans can have special physiques or bloodlines depending on the make-up of their lineage.\n\nHumans are one of the most vanilla species in this world. A base human does not have any inherent advantages. Compared to other humanoid species such as elves with their high affinity to natural mana, and dwarves with their naturally high strength, a human is as basic as it gets.\n\nHowever, when a human mixes with another species, the offspring is guaranteed to be human but with a special boost which is the special physique or bloodline of the other species.\n\nThat begs the question, how does it all work? Naturally, procreation should be impossible across different species! And that fact remains true as long as the human and the other species haven’t yet reached the Core Formation realm.\n\nOnce a mage, regardless of species, breaks through Foundation Establishment into Core Formation, they are no longer considered as a member of their base species. For elves and dwarves, this is when they branch out into different sub-species. \n\nFor elves, depending on their cultivation method and alignment, they either become high elves, dark elves, wood elves, mers, or fae. As for dwarves who live in isolated clans, they advance into the inner circle of their respective clans such as the Ashfire dwarves, or the Bluesteel dwarves.\n\nAs for beasts that have reached Core Formation, they gain the ability to adopt a new form based on their cultivation method and alignment. Many chose to adopt a humanoid form, others choose to push deeper with their current form.\n\nNonetheless, once they reach this stage, mages can copulate cross-species. Which opens up the world to a more varied genetic make-up. It is analogous to jumping from nucleated ponds to one large ocean.\n\nIn the case of Gaige, it just so happened that his mother had an extremely pure draconic bloodline. His father, during his travels, once met a beautiful woman out in the woods. Her raven black hair, deep blue eyes, and slender and seductive figure completely enamoured him. After spending a few years with her, one day she just left. His father searched far and wide, but never found her again.\n\n10 years later, a baby was dropped off in front of the Bori household with a letter. It was from the woman Gaige’s father met. The letter affirmed that the child was his, but Gaige’s father was sceptical. That was until he looked into the babies eyes and saw the same deep blue void that belonged to that woman. He knew right then and there, without a shadow of a doubt that the baby was his.\n\nHe took the baby in and raised it diligently with his other children. Since Gaige was from another woman, his presence was always a scar in his current mother’s heart. She thought that Gaige’s father strayed and had relations outside of the marriage. No matter how much his father tried to clarify that he didn’t, Gaige’s current mother just didn’t believe him.\n\nWhat his parents failed to realise was that Gaige’s birth mother was a Core Condensation stage Abyssal Wyrm in human form. Wyrms have naturally long gestation periods, it was only 10 years because the other half was human, otherwise, she would have carried the child for half a century. His father had an inkling that the other woman was of a different base species. But which one, that detail forever remained a mystery.\n\nThis also meant that the potency of the Abyssal Wyrm bloodline in Gaige’s body was extremely high, he just didn't know it.\n\nWhile this signified that Gaige had a limitless future, when it is inert at the early stages of cultivation, the Abyssal Wyrm’s bloodline is highly volatile \n\nNearly all bloodlines and physiques naturally activate once the mage breaches into Foundation Establishment. It is at that realm when their inherent advantages start to become visible. It is also unsafe for a Mana Condensation mage to activate their bloodlines or physiques as it can cause adverse effects on the unprepared body such as abrupt mutation, rapid cellular regeneration resulting in tumorous growths, and even death.\n\nSo for Gaige, his problems were two-fold. First, his current cultivation method was the Bori clan’s ‘Bright-Fire Path’. It was naturally attuned to the light and fire elements, which weren’t compatible with his bloodline. Second, the inert Abyssal Wyrm bloodline would randomly wreak havoc as he tried to advance his realm methodically.\n\nAfter going through the academy’s library, Wei Zao had developed a two-pronged solution. First, he had to develop a cultivation method aligned with darkness. And second, he had to devise a strategy to either suppress the Abyssal Wyrm bloodline or activate it safely, so that Gaige could advance in his cultivation.\n\nGetting a darkness aligned cultivation method was easy. After collecting a series of dark-type cultivation methods, the Omniscient Library collated a fitting style that closely matched Gaige’s bloodline and could support him till Foundation Establishment. To go further, Wei Zao would need to collect more Advanced methods for his library.\n\nFor the next step, Wei Zao decided to use special potions that would facilitate partial bloodline activation. For those, he needed rare ingredients that weren’t readily available in the academy. \n\nAnd that’s why he was now standing outside the Alchemy Guild’s Building.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-009]]","n":0.026}}},{"i":211,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 007 - Kerfuffle in the Library","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n‘What the hell is he doing?’ Guy exclaimed as he tried to divert his attention from the irritating noise.\n\nThe sound continued for a minute and then stopped. But then immediately after, it resumed. It sounded as if someone was aggressively turning the pages of a book.\n\n‘Who even reads like that?’ Guy asked himself sarcastically.\n\nThe noise attracted the attention of Mai, who was sitting across from Guy, and she irritatedly stood up and walked towards the source.\n\nGuy had an inkling of what was going to happen. He had read way too many novels, and this scenario looked like a layup right into a slam-dunk. He was up for some entertainment so he stealthily moved towards a seat closer to the show. All he was missing was some popcorn.\n\n“What are you doing?” A feminine voice spoke up first. This caused the aggressive turning to stop.\n\n“Reading,” a nonchalant masculine voice responded.\n\n‘Wow, what an asshole. Does it count as reading if you swipe through pages after a cursory glance?’ Guy ran his commentary.\n\n“What’s with the mountain of books? Are you going to read all of them?”\n\n“Yes,” Jo replied. \n\nGuy really wanted to punch his face after hearing the way he spoke. ‘This dude really knows how to push people’s buttons.’\n\nThe girl responded with the formulaic “hmph!” and stomped out. Guy figured this girl wouldn’t let Jo go that easily. After all, it's the integrity of one’s face we’re talking about here.\n\nGuy returned to reading his book while trying really hard to tune out the horrendous noise of aggressive page-turning. After a while, he got used to it and it turned into white noise.\n\nCompared to the rate at which Jo was consuming books, Guy was a lot slower. One thing Guy didn’t understand was the reason for Jo’s urgency. There was at least a year left till the next apprentice tournament. And given that he only had one student there shouldn’t have been a need for Jo to hoard all the books in the library.\n\nSure he had an almost cheat-like ability to perfectly copy books by just scanning through the pages. But that meant that he had an advantage!\n\nShrugging off the absurdity of the current situation, Guy returned the book he was currently reading and picked up the next one.\n\nAs he moved across the rows of shelves, he saw Jo coming out from one row and entering the next. Guy watched enviously as Jo continued his usual shenanigans.\n\nThe library itself wasn’t as big as those back on Earth. The books here were specialised and were primarily on magecraft. So there were sections for cultivation methods, basics of beast taming, alchemy (the medicinal kind not the one where they turn metal into gold), spell-casting, and some primers on enchanting and smithing.\n\nEvery time Guy found an interesting proposition for Markus, he would take down some notes for future reference. Since Guy had only recently entered this world, he was still a little green when it came to casting spells and cultivating in general. Guy wanted to shore up his basics so that he could practice by himself later on and gain some experience.\n\nWhile laying in bed last night, Guy tried to cultivate by following the method the old body used. It was called ‘Way of the Burning Fist,’ and it was a martial-arts centric cultivation style, which happened to be the most common type in this world. As its name suggested, the method enhanced the user’s affinity with the fire element and naturally infused the user’s mana with burning properties. \n\nAs he read through it, Guy couldn’t help but facepalm. It was filled with lines that reminded him of those bogus motivational books. The first chapter was full of drivel asking the reader to imagine ‘You’re a great big burgeoning flame. A bright orange light that burns everything in its path. You consume everything indiscriminately. You are fire! Be the Fire!’\n\nGuy nearly tossed the book in the trash. Unfortunately, he couldn’t delete books from the RoK. Guy tried to console himself by saying that the original body chose this because it looked easy to learn. But after looking through a few others, Guy really wanted to quit being a mage.\n\nThe worst offenders were the styles that catered to a singular element. They almost always contained similar mantras asking the reader to ‘be a sturdy tree’, or ‘be flowing water’, or ‘be lightning’. Guy could empathise with Markus after reading those books. What the hell does ‘be lightning’ even mean? It was such an abstract statement that offered nothing in terms of insight.\n\nThere were other cultivation books in the RoK and the academy's library. Some were more profound, asking the reader to consider ideas and thoughts similar to those in philosophical discussions from his old world. For instance, one style asked the reader to ‘consider the need for material possessions.’ That particular style encouraged the reader to pursue complete dissociation from the world and to achieve a state free of earthly restraints. As a person borne from a capitalistic family, separating himself from his material possessions was asking for death.\n\nGuy wanted to delve deeper into what made a cultivation method, but the Sword of Damocles called the apprentice tournament hung over his neck!\n\nAnother observation Guy made was about spells. There were many kinds of spells recorded in the library. Essentially, they could be classified into three main categories: ritual-based, chanting-based, and circle-based.\n\nRitual-based magic generally required preparation. The effects of these magics were massive in scale and would require a lot of reagents and complicated inscriptions and chants. These magics were tier-less, only requiring a fixed amount of mana which in turn could be extracted from nature, or multiple mages all involved in the ritual. These rituals could be self-sustaining as long as the appropriate reagents were provided.\n\nChanting-based magic was the most common type. Its advantage was that the caster only had to remember the exact series of phrases and intonations corresponding to the magic they wanted to cast. The words were in a language called ‘Ancient Tongue’ which had very strict semantic laws, ensuring that its meaning could never be misunderstood. Because of that, the language was highly mana resonant. The only disadvantage of this type of magic was that the spell must meet the nature of the user’s cultivation style. A mage practising earth-based styles couldn’t chant fire-type magic, no matter how hard they tried. \n\nThe final type was circle-based magic. This type of magic was cultivation-neutral, which meant anyone could use it. The only disadvantage was that the caster had to memorise a convoluted diagram called formations. The diagram was usually enveloped by a circle, with the complexity of the designs inside it corresponding to the complexity of the magic itself. There were many familiar geometric shapes, however, he couldn’t figure out their purpose. He would have to break it down and evaluate everything in detail to properly decode how this magic worked. He also found some text in Ancient Tongue inside some of the shapes.\n\nThe tiers of the last two types of magic depended on the amount of mana required. There was usually a range that determined where these spells ranked.\n\nGuy straight-away crossed out ritual magics as an option since they were too complicated, expensive and time inefficient. He also cancelled chanting magic, as it would require a cultivation style to complement it. The only option left was the circle magics.\n\nGuy then began keeping an eye out for some promising spells to try later on. But as he was doing so, he saw that Jo had finished his hoarding and was now leaving the library.\n\nOn his way out, Jo was stopped by Mai.\n\n“Wait! Jo, I have a question. I saw that you were reading the book on mana-efficient alchemy, I have a doubt about one topic brought up by the author. Can you help me out?” Mai asked. Even though Guy couldn’t see her face, her voice clearly carried a hint of condescension.\n\n‘Is this the legendary face-slapping?’ Guy prepared himself.\n\nJo responded dismissively, “Sure ask away.”\n\n“It said in the book that ‘siphoning raw mana into any mixture while aerating it was found to increase the efficiency of the infusion process.’ I don’t quite understand why.” \n\nJo smirked and said, “I know what you’re talking about, but you see the book had a typo in it. You don’t aerate the mixture, and you don't siphon raw mana. You are actually supposed to circulate air-infused mana to the mixture. The information was corrected in the book’s afterword which was later attached as an additional page. The reason for the method should be self-evident, so I won’t go into the details.”\n\nMai was taken aback. She ran to the shelf where the book was kept and quickly navigated to the final page.\n\nGuy could swear he heard a palm hitting soft flesh, like an unceremonious slap on a tender face. Or was it just inside his head?\n\nMai returned the book and slowly walked back to where Jo originally was. On her way, she noticed Guy trying to muffle his laughter. Guy quickly coughed and put on a neutral expression. But when he looked in front of him he saw that he too had subconsciously built a fort out of books. Guy’s eyes widened.\n\n‘Wait! Is it my turn? Girl ready your other cheek this daddy- wait where did she go?’ When Guy looked up, Mai was nowhere to be seen.\n\nAs he swivelled his head he heard a feminine voice moving farther away from the library.\n\n“Jo! Wait for me! I have some more things I want to discuss!”\n\nGuy sighed, ‘How does this even work? Why is she even attracted to him? Why do face-slappers get all the girls? Are these girls masochists? Mast please help!’ He cried internally.\n\n(…)\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-008]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":212,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 006 - Library Etiquette","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nGuy woke up early and was walking towards the academy library with a spring in his step. Yesterday, after he recognised Markus as his personal student, Mast sent out a notification that there had been an update in the RoK.\n\nWhile he lay in bed, Guy checked out the new functions and found that the first barrier in the RoK had been lifted, opening up access to a massive collection of elementary to middle school level study materials from his old world. \n\nAs a teacher, Guy used to spend a lot of time going through different publications to figure out the best options for the kids he was teaching. Since most of his students were living in poverty, Guy could not provide a long purchase list of textbooks - it would be impractical. Instead, Guy would stitch together content from a wide range of textbooks and provide a chimaera-book, as he used to call it, that went through all the pertinent topics with high efficiency - which means to have meaningful content and fewer pages. This was so, that should the students lose their books, the printing cost to get a new copy wouldn’t be astronomical. Through this method, Guy had unwittingly read through a lot of different books.\n\nWhile Guy didn’t know whether those books would be of any use to him in this magical world, he would never look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nGuy thought that he had arrived early, but just as soon as he stopped next to the library’s entrance, he saw Markus running towards him. The boy’s face emanated excitement, but as he noticed Guy standing outside the library it subtly shifted into shock.\n\nMarkus wanted to arrive early as well, but seeing his teacher waiting outside the library he started to panic. \n\n‘Oh no! I hope I didn’t make Teacher wait too long,’ he reprimanded himself.\n\nMarkus increased his pace and quickly arrived at his teacher’s position. While struggling to breathe, Markus apologised, “I’m so sorry to keep you waiting Teacher Larks.”\n\nGuy waved his hand, “Don’t worry about it. I came early because I was a little excited. You came just in time!”\n\nGuy let Markus catch his breath before he continued, “Let’s talk inside. I booked a table for us inside,” and then guided Markus into the library.\n\nOne good thing about being a coward was that the old Guy never offended anyone in his lifetime. In fact, apart from the infrequent disdainful glares, Guy was basically an invisible character in the academy.\n\nOnce the teacher and student scouted a sufficiently isolated desk in the library, they sat down and started their discussion.\n\n“So if I remember correctly, the first time we met, you said that you already tried all the cultivation methods in this library?” Guy probed.\n\nMarkus nodded with a trace of disappointment in his eyes.\n\n“I’m going to take it that you tried everything properly, and won’t go over them again to save time. Is that OK with you?” Guy tried to confirm.\n\n“Yes. I tried every single cultivation method here that was accessible to me. The problem I’m facing is that they just don’t resonate with me. Some of them are so abstract that I can’t wrap my head around them. Others talk about such profound thoughts that it doesn’t really relate to me,” Markus explained.\n\nGuy nodded along and thought about his plan of action. The Mana Condensation realm was the first realm for any mage. Once a prospective mage managed to clear up their mana channels and cast basic cantrips they’d be considered an Early Stage Mana Condensation mage. Within this realm, the main goal is to expand the mana channels that are overlaid on top of the blood vessels in the human body.\n\nThe purpose behind widening the channels is twofold. The first is to accommodate mana in its condensed form. Generally, mana is stored in the body of a Mana Condensation mage in a gaseous, wispy form. As the mage advances from the Early to Middle to Late stage, the size of the wisp inside the human body increases.\n\nOnce the mage gains sufficient insights and manages to break through to Foundation Establishment, this wisp condenses into a liquid-like form causing the impurities inside the human body to be expelled through the now widened mana channels, which is the second purpose.\n\nTo advance within the Mana Condensation realm, having a suitable cultivation method is the safest strategy as it naturally allows the mage to advance into Foundation Establishment. Cultivation methods also have tiers. \n\nThe Common methods are the lowest tiers. They are basic and can at most allow a mage to reach Core Formation Realm. They are basic as their contents touch on topics superficially, and hence the insights that can be gained from those methods are limited.\n\nAdvanced methods are a tier higher and can provide more insights. They are generally a continuation or expansion of Common methods and can usually carry the mage through their entire cultivation journey. Within the Common and Advanced tier, there are implicit subdivisions that depend on the specificity, relatability, applicability, and similar factors pertaining thot he method itself.\n\nSpecialised methods are those that are tailored to specific individuals, bloodlines, physiques, or even species. Depending on the applicability, that is the number of people that can use the method, the cultivation methods can have a higher rarity. \n\nAncestral methods are those that are passed down from generation to generation. These can be restricted to specific clans, sects or organisations. These are highly guarded and are passed down personally.\n\nIn this day and age, there are quite a few cultivation methods, both real and fake, floating around the market. Academies usually hold legitimate copies and segregate them based on quality and rarity. Most of the cultivation methods on the general floor are Common tier and with the lowest rarity. These work for 80-90% of the population.\n\nFor the unfortunate 10-20% that can’t comprehend or pick up a cultivation method, a less common method is to forcefully expand the channels by casting spells.\n\n“Even though you are my personal student, I don’t think we can access the more advanced cultivation methods in the library’s higher levels. The methods down here are the most common and generally widely compatible. But since we already know that you aren't compatible with them, I guess our only remaining option is to brute force our way through and practice spells,” Guy declared.\n\nMarkus didn’t display a positive reaction to that. He was even less confident about this method because there was an implicit requirement. “I don’t think that option will work for us either. I’m only in the Early stage, even the most basic spells they teach are Rank-1 in complexity. If I can’t even sustain a spell, how will I advance?” Markus lamented.\n\nGuy furrowed his brows. The situation presented an endless circle. To advance, Markus needed to cultivate. But without a suitable method, he could only forcefully expand his channels. However, as he was stuck in teh Early stage, he couldn't cast any spells till he reached Middle stage or higher. To do that, he had to cultivate! \n\nGuy hurriedly stopped his train of thought and calmed Markus by saying, “Hey! Let’s not count our chickens until they’ve hatched. There are so many books here on spells compared to cultivation methods. I bet you haven’t looked through all of them. Let’s see if we can find one that can work for us. First, I want you to go through the library and mark for me the books that you’ve already looked into.”\n\nAnd with that, the two dispersed.\n\nGuy started from the first shelf and picked up the first book titled “Comprehensive Guide on Fire Magic”. This particular book was not already in the RoK, so with every page he read, a copy materialised in his mind. Although the book stated that it was ‘Comprehensive’ it was not that long, and Guy managed to finish it in around 10 minutes. Once he returned the book to its shelf he started to scan the adjacent shelves for books that weren’t already inside his RoK.\n\nWhile he shuffled along, he noticed one of his colleague teaching apprentices sitting down at one of the desks between two rows of shelves. Mai Louts was her name, and she was the third teaching apprentice under Blevin. Her appearance was nothing short of exceptional. She had a perfect figure by Earth standards. Her face, like most others in this city, had a sandy brown hue, but her eyes were accentuated with a chestnut grey colour. Her dark wavy locks rested on her shoulders and waved as her head swivelled in place.\n\nMai felt as if someone was staring at her and looked up from her book. Guy’s and her eyes met. Guy involuntarily nodded his head as a salutation, but Mai didn’t respond and lowered her head with an arrogant sneer.\n\n‘Guess my colleagues aren’t my fans,’ Guy thought to himself and moved on.\n\nWhile he was doing so, Jo strutted into the library. Guy was a little peeved about the unfairness when it came to system distribution, but he couldn’t find a valid argument to move Mast, so Guy just dropped it.\n\nJo waved superficially waved towards Guy - to which Guy responded - and then walked towards the shelf farthest from the entrance. On his way, he greeted Mai, who gave him her regular response.\n\n‘I have a bad feeling about this…’ Guy had a sudden premonition.\n\nGuy decided to push down his uneasiness and continued reading his book. But not 5 seconds after he resumed, an ungodly, periodic “Shh Shh Shh” sound echoed in the library.\n\n‘Oh, here we go...’\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-007]]","n":0.025}}},{"i":213,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 005 - Markus Reva","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\nMarkus was distraught. Today was supposed to be the last day to secure for himself a teacher. Although it wasn’t mandatory, to be a personal student of a teacher had a lot of benefits. There were increased access to resources to cultivate, better living arrangements, and much more.\n\nAs an orphan, Markus didn’t have a lot going for him. He had a simple dream, to be able to protect everyone in the orphanage. The life of orphans in this world wasn’t easy. There were dangers everywhere, be it beasts or even humans themselves. \n\nFor that, they needed strength. And of all the other orphans in the orphanage, Markus displayed the greatest level of perception of mana. Humans weren’t naturally predisposed to magic, unlike most other species in this world. It was only those that could sense the flow of mana in the environment that had some level of aptitude in pursuing mage-hood.\n\nWith that in mind, the other orphans and Markus scrounged, did odd jobs, and finally earned enough to pay Markus’ enrolment fees. His goal was to advance far enough to be able to protect the small orphanage he lived in and the caretaker mistress that ran it.\n\nBut his dreams died a slow and painful death with every day that passed during his time in the Academy. He was only a simple 12-year old who was thrown into the deep end with no friends or acquaintances. With the constant bullying from his peers and his lack of potential, Markus’ spirit was gradually waning. He was doomed to be stuck at the lowest level of the Mana Condensation realm.\n\nTechnically, those at the Mana Condensation realm and aspiring to become mages are called mage practitioners. This was because almost everyone with a base level of mana perceptivity could practice basic cantrips. Cantrips are spells that depend on the most basic mana manipulation. Spells such as |Magic Missle|, |Inspect|, |Mana Ball|, and |Mana Wave|.\n\nBut cantrips couldn’t help mages to advance. To progress within the Mana Condensation realm one needed to exercise their mana pathways. This could be done in two ways. The first, and the most common, was to utilise a cultivation method that resonated with the person. Cultivation methods included insights and mantras that exercised the mind and will. When the mind resonated with these insights, the mana within the body would circulate. \n\nMarkus tried countless cultivation methods in the Academy library. None of them resonated with him. They were either too profound or delved into abstract ideas that didn’t make any sense to him. He couldn’t ask anyone for help since everyone edged away when he approached them.\n\nThe second method was to exercise the pathways by casting spells. It was a cruder strategy, akin to brute forcing through the first realm, but it worked. The only issue was that all spells, apart from cantrips, were Rank-1 in complexity and required the person to be at least in the middle stage of Mana Condensation.\n\nThis was also impossible for Markus who was still stuck in the lowest stage of Mana Condensation.\n\nAfter the end of the first semester, there was usually a fresher’s week where newly enrolled students could look for prospective teachers who would take them on as personal students. Generally, all students would get picked since there was usually a similar quantity of students and apprentices.\n\nOnly those students that couldn’t stand out, yet still wanted to take a final gambit, would attend these fresher’s weeks. The gifted students would be plucked by the certified teachers much earlier.\n\nAs a last-ditch effort, Markus decided to attend the fresher’s week. And that was the decisive blow.\n\nDuring the entire week, every teaching apprentice Markus approached would send him away politely or straight up reject him to his face. With each rejection, Markus’ self-esteem took a hit. On the final day, in the final hour, there was only him left in the yard. Markus was distraught. He was at a point where he was regretting ever joining the Academy.\n\n‘Why bother? People like me aren’t meant to cultivate,’ he said while slowly started to internalise his shattered self. If he were left to his devices at this point, Markus would have been truly lost. But something, or someone, saved him that day.\n\nBefore Markus left the yard, he looked up and his eyes met another person’s who was standing on the other end of the yard. The person’s attire indicated that he was a teaching apprentice. Markus didn’t hold any hopes, there were still a few students who didn’t have a teacher that didn’t show up today. The teaching apprentice would probably pick from them.\n\n‘Why would he pick me?’ Markus scolded himself for raising his expectations.\n\nAs Markus observed the man’s face, he saw that the man was thinking about something.\n\n‘Will he pick me?’ Markus asked himself. ‘No!’\n\nBut then the most surprising thing happened. The man’s expression morphed from uncertainty to unwavering confidence. He then started to walk towards Markus. Markus looked around him, there was no one else. If the man wanted to leave the yard, he would have to walk the other way.\n\n‘He’s coming this way!’ Markus exclaimed excitedly.\n\nEach step the man took was like another inch of rope descending into the dark well Markus was currently stuck in. By the time the man was an arm’s length away from Markus, the rope was practically dangling in front of him. Markus wanted to grab on, but he was apprehensive. He had learned better than to have false hope.\n\n“Excuse me. Hi Mr…” the man searched for Markus’ name tag, “Ah! Mr. Reva” The man spoke with respect. This startled Markus. This was the first time someone extended a modicum of respect to him.\n\n“Yes?” Markus asked.\n\n“Hi. My name is Guy Larks. I’m a Teaching Apprentice. I came here to inquire whether you’re looking for a teacher? Because you see I’m looking to take on a personal student, and I wanted to know if you were interested?” Guy enunciated his words steadily and kept his eyes locked onto Markus’.\n\nMarkus was a little shaken at the development. He wanted to accept right then and there, but involuntarily, he blurted out, “Why me?”\n\n“Huh?” Guy was taken aback at that question. Observing the expression on his face Markus swore inwardly. He just got an opportunity and he blew it!\n\n“Why not you?” Guy asked inquisitively.\n\n“Umm… I’m still stuck in the lowest stage of Mana Condensation realm. And I couldn’t find a suitable cultivation method from the school’s library. I’m afraid I am unsuitable to be a mage. So I was just wondering why you chose me?” Markus asked cautiously.\n\nGuy laughed out loud. “Young man you have the worst case of low self-esteem I have ever seen. Do you think you’re the only disappointment in this Academy? Look at me, I’ve barely reached the late stage of Mana Condensation! Worry not! I chose you because you seem to be looking for someone to help you out of a dark place. And you see I am also stuck in a dark place myself. Why don’t we both help each other? Hmm?”\n\nMarkus was completely taken in by Guy’s response. If he wasn’t actively holding himself back, Markus feared he would have burst into tears right then and there.\n\nGuy was a little worried observing Markus’ silence, so he decided to elaborate further. “Here’s the deal. You are looking to advance, correct? Well, I need to hold onto this job too. So I’m going to make a promise. I promise that by the end of this semester, I will find a way for you to advance in your cultivation. If I fail, I will lose my job. You on the other hand won’t have anything to lose. What do you say?”\n\nGuy extended his arm towards Markus, who involuntarily flinched. But seeing that the Guy was asking for a handshake to seal the deal, Markus, who was at first on the ledge, readily grabbed it and shook it aggressively. With each shake, Markus slowly ascended from the dark well of despair.\n\nGuy radiated a warm smile. After working as a teacher and meeting a lot of kids, he could easily read their expressions. Markus, while he tried hard to hide his emotions, wore his heart on his sleeves. Guy empathised with the poor kid, he had seen students who were so bullied that their entire psyche was shattered. He had taken a few courses in child psychology when completing his teaching degree, and Guy had become more astute in picking up on clues. \n\nGuy truly wished for him to have success. The promise he made was not half-hearted, he was prepared to go all out to help Markus overcome the shadows in his heart.\n\n“Alright, so let’s get ourselves registered and settled in shall we?” Guy pulled Markus towards himself and the two walked side-by-side towards the student registration building to officially enrol Markus as Guy’s personal student.\n\nAs they entered the registration office, Guy picked up on some conversations from one of the other offices.\n\n“Did you hear? That Jo… Yea that kid who caused one of Teacher Hinds’ students to suffer a deviation in his cultivation… He picked up a personal student and you won’t guess who! No… No… Alright alright, I’ll tell you. It was that crippled Bori kid! Yea Gaige Bori! HA! Those two wastes joining in, what are they going to accomplish? That Jo made a bet with me that he could get Gaige to enter the middle stage of Mana Condensation within 2 weeks, and that the loser would run naked around the schoolyard… Yea of course I took on that bet!”\n\nGuy coughed loudly to attract one of the clerks’ attention. A plump woman slowly made her way from inside. She wore a pleasant smile and had cheeks so rosy you’d want to pinch them until they fell off.\n\n“Hello, Apprentice Larks. How can I help you?” the clerk started.\n\n“Hi. This student here, Mr. Markus Reva, would like to be my personal student. I’m here to go through the formalities,” Guy spoke politely.\n\n“Sure! Sure!” The clerk exclaimed.\n\nThe entire process was fairly basic. Signing a few forms, applying for new accommodations, picking up a few items. The usual.\n\nOnce everything was done, Guy and Markus made their way towards Markus’ new living accommodation.\n\n“It was a long day today, so let’s not exhaust ourselves. I want you to rest well. Since you’re my personal student, your morning classes have been moved towards the evening. So I want you to meet me outside the library first thing in the morning,” Guy instructed.\n\nMarkus nodded excitedly and thanked Guy profusely for accepting him as a student. Guy simply waved it off and gently shoved Markus into the building.\n\nThat night Markus found it difficult to sleep. Usually, it was because his roommates would assault him or cause some disturbance. But now that he was in a solo room, there was no such problem. The reason why he couldn’t sleep was due to the sheer excitement!\n\nAlthough he was only 12 years old, Markus was more mature than other children his age. He already knew that advancing for him was difficult. Even with a teacher, he didn’t have any expectations. All he was thankful for was that there was someone who didn’t give up on him straight away. Someone that actually wanted to help him.\n\nFor many people, even basic respect was something hard to get.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-006]]","n":0.023}}},{"i":214,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 004 - (Un)Fair","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n“Psst… Wanna be my student?”\n\n“Eww! Get away from me, you creep!”\n\n“Damn it!” Jo cursed as the teenage girl he was talking to ran away towards her group of girlfriends.\n\n“I don’t think that was a good way to approach them…” Guy muttered incredulously. Inside, Guy was cursing his old self’s luck for befriending such an idiot.\n\n“It’s the last day of fresher’s week man! It’s now or never! It’s not like some bloke with heavenly luck is going to drop into our laps. We have to be more proactive!” Jo started to pump himself up.\n\n“Relax Jo -”\n\n“It’s Zao.” Jo interrupted.\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“It’s pronounced Zao, first name Wei last name Zao. It’s uh… oriental name. Yeah, that’s right!” Jo started to rattle out quickly.\n\n“That’s not how you spell it though. And I don’t think there is an Orient here.” Guy pointed out.\n\nThe two “friends” were currently strolling around Radiant Academy’s grounds. The academy was one of the central landmarks in Radiant City, which was part of the Maika Duchy. \n\nThis new world, called Gaea, was somewhat similar to Earth. Except it was still in the middle ages. With the presence of magic and mana, technological development had stagnated and hadn’t advanced for a few 1000 years. There were various empires and kingdoms dotted across the globe, most practised feudalism, while others had variations or completely novel governmental structures.\n\nThe kingdom he was currently in was called the Solar Empire, and within the Empire, the Academy was in one of the less prominent Duchies which was controlled by Maika Clan.\n\nIn this world, people could use magic. From birth, everyone had some level of affinity to using magic and spells, but those with proper aptitude and skill that chose to go further in the field were called mages. The more advanced the mage was, realm-wise, the stronger they were and the longer they lived. Hence it was inevitable that most people in positions of power had some form of cultivation since the prevailing philosophy of this world was “might is right”. There was no place for weakness.\n\nWith regards to cultivation, a budding mage had only a few options to choose from. But regardless of their choice, they would almost always share the same starting point.\n\nNearly all individuals who aim to become a mage would first opt to enrol into an Academy. These were neutral establishments that were generally affiliated with the authority where they were established. For instance, the Radiant Academy answered to the Maika Duchy, which answered to Solar Empire. \n\nThese magic academies were fairly pricey to enrol into and would only support the students till they reached Foundation Establishment, that too only for 5 years at max. If a student failed to reach Foundation Establishment within that time frame, that meant they didn’t have any aptitude in magic. That is why students usually dropped out within their first two years if they found themselves progressing at a snail’s pace.\n\nOnce a student graduated from a magic academy, they would be faced with four options. The first and most straightforward option was to pursue magic as a rogue practitioner. Rogue practitioners were few and far in between. This was because advancing in magic is a resource-intensive endeavour, and sourcing resources is naturally difficult for unaffiliated rogue practitioners. That did not mean that rogue mages weren’t successful. There have been historical records of various renowned rogue mages. But the fact remained, it is not a path suited for the average.\n\nThe second, and the rarest of options was to find tutelage with a certified teacher. Within academies, the teachers essentially held the highest authority. Due to the neutrality of schools, teachers had complete freedom when it came to where they sought employment. There were certification tests that teachers could take to gain prestige and raise their employability and fame. Teachers were also not restricted by political boundaries. This inevitably meant that they weren’t allowed to interfere in political conflicts.\n\nShould a certified teacher recognise your skill, they would decide to take the student under their wings as a disciple. Being a renowned teacher’s disciple was also a prestigious opportunity. Due to their neutrality, they would often obtain many opportunities from powerful figures and organisation. And these opportunities would naturally trickle down to the teacher’s disciples.\n\nThe other three options included joining a clan, sect, or private organisation. A clan status is awarded to large and prominent families. Most clans have deep roots and lots of clout. Large clans usually had control over vast lands, which were further divided for the smaller clans under them. It was properly feudalistic. If one decided to join a clan and work their way up, they would be completely tied to the clan. However for clans, if the mage showed promise, the amount of resource they would receive would also proportionally increase.\n\nA sect is something like a clan except there are no blood ties between its members. mages can opt to join a sect, but they will most likely have to go through a gruelling entrance exam. Within the sect, there are levels, which the mage can ascend by taking missions or gaining achievements. The sects have some leeway with regards to entering and exiting, but once you reached a high enough position, leaving wasn’t an option. Sects usually remained unaffiliated, but proximity and positioning usually decided which faction a sect aligned itself with.\n\nFinally, a mage could also seek to gain employment with a private organisation. Companies and organisations naturally needed their own muscle. To do this they would cultivate loyalty into the mages from a mouldable age. Becoming an employee for a private organisation usually came with huge rewards, but equally high risks. There was always subterfuge and wars of attrition occurring between organisations. Since capitalism never rests.\n\nThere were many other lesser-known options for mages, but the above options provided more guarantees and were generally more successful.\n\nIt was still early in the morning, and the apprentices had nought to do except troll for some prospective students. Since this was the last day, only the most desperate teachers and students remained.\n\nAs the day progressed, fewer students remained, and even fewer apprentices were standing student-less. Those that did remain were ones without any prospects. All except for Dahrk Boise, the star of the current generation of apprentices. He was considered to be the cream of the crop, the academy’s poster boy for the next generation. He was a breath away from breaking into the Foundation Establishment realm and had numerous accomplishments. All the students that he taught showered praises upon him, which in turn elevated his supervising teacher’s ranking within the academy.\n\nDahrk was currently standing in a very conspicuous position at the centre of the yard, his eyes scanning the crowd. On an obfuscated corner of the yard, a few teaching apprentices, including Guy, were talking amongst themselves.\n\n“Why is Dahrk still without a student? I thought he’d take one on the first day. There was literally a huge line of students begging to be taught by him. Damn it! Pretty boys get all the luck!” One of the apprentices grumbled.\n\n“Apparently he’s waiting for a ‘promising seed’. Yech! What arrogance!” Another chimed in.\n\n“You’re just jealous that he has a choice. Once the week ends and he is still without a student, I bet you the Academy will personally assign one to him. They may even strip one from under the tutelage of another apprentice.” The first one retorted.\n\n“Look! Another student’s approaching him!” The second pointed out.\n\nBack at the centre of the yard, a dark-haired and scrawny boy confidently strutted towards Dahrk, with a resolute expression dyed across his face. He looked a little malnourished for a 12-year-old, but his visible musculature indicated that he had undergone some form of formal training in martial arts.\n\nAs the boy approached Dahrk, slowly his resolute expression started to wane. And by the time he was standing before Dahrk, his body nearly crumpled into itself as he struggled to look the apprentice in the eyes.\n\nWith great difficulty, the boy mumbled, “Teacher Boise! I… Please take me in as you student.” and bowed showing his respects.\n\nDahrk glanced at the boy. His eyes threatened to penetrate the boy’s soul.\n\n“Who’s that kid?” One of the apprentices next to Guy asked.\n\n“Holy shit! That kid’s the third son of the Bori clan.” The second apprentice answered without missing the beat.\n\n“No way! Gaige Bori! The kid who was already into Middle stage Mana Condensation when he joined? I heard he lost his cultivation though,” the first one recollected and voiced out loud.\n\n“Yeah. Poor guy. He was a hardworking one, that kid. Even worse was that after his cultivation regressed, the marriage he had lined up fell through, now it’s his second brother who’s set to marry the girl,” the second apprentice voiced emphatically.\n\n“Y’all are just tossing out exposition left and right huh?” Guy commented casually. The other teachers looked at him with a questioning gaze to which he simply waved his hand and pointed at the spectacle before him.\n\nDuring the time when the two apprentices were providing story-specific exposition, Gaige had now gotten down on his knees and was begging profusely for the teacher to accept him. He promised that the regressed cultivation was only momentary and he could feel deep inside that he’d make a comeback. Unfortunately for him, Dahrk didn’t even bother to look down at the prostrating kid and walked away.\n\nLooking at the sorry state of the kid, Guy felt a little bad. And that’s when it hit him!\n\n“That’s an MC template!” He muttered. But what surprised him even more, was that Jo, who was standing next to him, actually said the same statement out loud.\n\nGuy turned towards Jo, who was enthusiastically walking towards the grovelling Gaige with a spring in his step. \n\n‘Something’s weird… Hey Mast, do you get a feeling that Jo is acting a little weird?’ Guy spoke inwardly.\n\n(Hmm. Let me see.) Mast said and then disappeared from his head.\n\nBy this time, Jo was already standing next to Gaige and was talking to him with a serious expression on his face. Reading Jo’s lips, Guy could make out a few words.\n\n‘-raconic Bloodline?… Oh Draconic Bloodline! Is he just spewing bullshit now? Woah, look at how wide that kid’s eyes are! Jo must’ve been right! But how? \nHold up! That doesn’t matter! that kid’s golden! Damn it why didn’t I get to him first. The MC’s thigh should have been mine to grab!’ Guy cursed inwardly while metaphorically raising his fist towards the heavens.\n\nJust as Guy was lamenting his misfortune, Mast dropped another bomb. (Damn! That’s my sister!)\n\nGuy was shocked. ‘Where? I thought this place belonged to your elder brother!’\n\n(I meant that man, Jo, you were talking about. I inspected him, and my sister’s inside his head! Hahahaha! He’s another one like you!) Mast mirthfully commented.\n\n{Yo Big Brother!!} A cheerful feminine voice resonated inside Guy’s head.\n\n(Hey &&#$*! Wait, let’s use your plebian name Moni. My guy here doesn’t understand high-dimensional languages,) Mast spoke calmly.\n\n{Sup! So you brought one over too huh?}\n\n(I made a mistake and had to compensate this one. I heard Big Bro is trying some new stuff with this world and was struggling. I wanted to check it out, and well this was a pleasant opportunity. So what’s up with you?)\n\n‘Wait wait! You’re saying whoever is inside Jo is also a transmigrator?’\n\n{Yup! I brought that one from my world!}\n\nGuy had a lot of questions, but he asked the one that was on the tip of his tongue. ‘How different is your world from Mast’s?’\n\n(There’s something called life force or ki in her world. There are also a few more ‘alien’ lifeforms in close proximity to Earth.)\n\n‘So does that guy also have a system?’ Guy asked Moni cautiously.\n\n{What is with you humans and your systems? Yes, he does. The guy practically begged me to give him one. Basically, he worked as a librarian in my world, so he wanted a library that could record data on things he touched. Like everything from strengths, weaknesses, methods to improve and so on.}\n\nGuy screamed internally, ‘He has a Library of Heaven’s Path! Damn it Mast!’\n\nMast ignored Guy’s tantrum and calmly instructed Moni. (You have to be careful Moni. Don’t mess too much with Big Bro’s world, otherwise, he’s gonna really lose it.)\n\n{I know. I know.} Guy could almost hear her wave her hand dismissively.\n\n{Well. I’m gonna go have some fun! By the way Guy, do you want me to tell him you’re a transmigrator too?} Moni asked.\n\nGuy thought about it for some time. But then he decided to let it be. Since the two of them weren’t from the same world, there was no point. Besides, Guy really didn’t like that Jo guy’s character. He reminded him too much of one of his college professors who could never take a loss. That professor would always try to argue with his students whenever they asked a counter-question.\n\nWith all that said, Moni evacuated from Guy’s mind. By the time Guy came to, he saw that the apprentices next to him had already dispersed and had presumably found a student. Near the end of the day, in the yard, there was only one student left and Guy.\n\nGuy looked at the student and the student looked at Guy. Guy regretted that he didn’t act when he saw the MC template character.\n\n‘Hmm, what to do?’ Guy sighed.\n\nMast calmly spoke up. (What about that kid over there? He seems to be looking for a teacher.)\n\n‘Ah! But that kid’s not as good as the MC template. He probably has a low potential. I don’t know if I can save my job if I take him in…’ Guy replied.\n\n(Low potential doesn’t mean no potential. I thought teachers never discriminated when it came to teaching students?) Mast commented offhandedly.\n\nHearing that, Guy both inwardly and outwardly slapped his forehead. He had nearly fallen into a trap common amongst teachers. It was usual for teachers to have favourite students, and students they hated. Most teachers hated student who disrupted their classes, slacked off or were generally weak in learning. It is a natural human reaction. But it was the worst thing a teacher could do. \n\nStudents come to school to learn, it is their only chance to advance in life. For a lot of them, the world has given up on them and this is the only way for them to escape. The kids that act out are basically seeking attention because either they’re lacking it in their own families, or are struggling inside. If even their teachers give up on them, then the students are damned to eternity.\n\nGuy’s face morphed and exuded seriousness. With long and confident strides, Guy made his way towards the lone student at the other end of the yard.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-005]]","n":0.02}}},{"i":215,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 003 - Guy's Goal in Life","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nGuy was a little disappointed with his system. How come all the other MCs get some uber cheat-like skill while his is just a useless library of books?\n\n(What’s the matter?) Mast was a little bummed out at Guy’s response. He expected Guy to be a bit more positive because he had put a lot of thought into it. World builders weren’t exactly imaginative and inventive beings. Mast had to borrow from different sources to create the RoK.\n\n‘It doesn’t do anything man. It’s just a library. I thought it would be… I don’t know… more awesome I guess?’ Guy muttered in a low voice.\n\nMast furrowed his eyebrows as he tried to decipher what Guy meant.\n\n(You said you wanted to teach. And based on my research, this library would be an amazing resource for any teacher to have.) Mast tried to explain his point of view.\n\n‘I know… It’s just that I thought the system would have something more to it. Like maybe it could translate people’s capabilities into book form so that I can read it and get to know them better. Or maybe it compiled similar books into one without any errors in it.’ Guy tried to explain his reasoning.\n\nMast finally understood why Guy was so disappointed with the RoK. And so with a stern voice, Mast responded. (But that would be cheating. All the things that you just said are part of what makes a good teacher. To know a student’s weaknesses and tailor the lessons to their needs. To comprehend and apply knowledge. To provide guidance both academically and in some cases provide emotional support. If I gave you a system that did all that, what use are you?)\n\nThe gut-punch threw Guy for a loop. He went into deep thought; it was true that he had become a little complacent after transmigrating.\n\n(What is your goal?) Mast asked with an imposing voice.\n\n‘To be a good teacher!’ Guy responded almost subconsciously.\n\nThat was it! His goal was to be a good teacher. Nothing more nothing less. In his entire previous life, the happiest he had ever been was seeing the cheerful faces of the kids whose lives he’d changed. All he wished for in his death bed was to keep spreading that happiness. After transmigrating into this world, Guy had gotten too caught up in the fantastical elements. His goal was never to rebel against authority or to overturn the heavens and earth. He just wanted to teach, and give those without any power some hope.\n\nAs he finished his thoughts, Guy mellowed out. His anger dissipated and was instead replaced with immense shame. Guy realised that he had been ungrateful. While Mast played some part in his death, it was not something he intended to do. In fact, he even gave Guy another shot at life. He even made the RoK for him!\n\nWith a resolute expression, Guy bowed and apologised profusely. ‘I’m sorry Mast. You’re right! The RoK is perfect for a teacher.’\n\nMast was elated to see that Guy liked his gift. In response Mast added, (Well. I considered everything you said, and I guess I could add something extra to the RoK. A cheat if you will.)\n\nWith that Mast snapped his fingers, and an archaic-looking printing press materialised next to the desk at the centre of the RoK. \n\nWith wide eyes, Guy approached the contraption. ‘Woah! What is this thing?’\n\nWith a smirk Mast moved towards the press and placed his arm on it. (It is a Printing Press or PP for short. It’s pretty big ain’t it.)\n\nGuy didn’t know if Mast did that on purpose or not, but he still went along with it. ‘Yes. It’s… huge. Anyways what does it do?’\n\n(As its name suggests, it prints books from your library.)\n\nBefore Mast could continue Guy exclaimed, ‘That’s awesome! Now that’s what I call a cheat!’\n\n(But! The press can only print multiple copies of books that you or your students publish, or books that don’t exceed 40% similarity with the contents of this library. You can only print one exact copy of a book from the RoK. Actually, it is set that only one hard copy can exist outside of the RoK. The moment you print another, the first will disappear.)\n\nLike a burst balloon Guy’s expression deflated once again. ‘Why just me or my students? Why can’t I publish any book from the RoK?’\n\n(It’s obvious. What if you mass print a rare book and sell it for a profit. You’re a teacher, not a capitalist.)\n\nWith a wry smile Guy inwardly cursed Mast’s intuition. \n\n(On top of that, these books aren't originally from this world. The knowledge they contain is not chronologically accurate either. We can justify the spread of new knowledge in this world if it is from a primary source as it is contained and measured. However, if unregistered knowledge is disseminated through secondary sources, there is a high probability of it blowing out of proportions uncontrollably. This will inevitably draw my brother's attention. And we don't want that. Not at this point, anyway.)\n\nAnd with that, Mast dematerialised from the RoK, leaving Guy to his own devices.\n\nGuy decided to explore the RoK by himself. He found that the shelves could be reordered based on certain search criteria. For instance, if he was interested in searching for cultivation techniques with a focus on fire-based arts, the shelves would rearrange themselves. And based on closeness to the search parameters, the most relevant books that he’d read would move towards the centre of the room, while the least relevant ones would be pushed further. The time for the rearranging was negligible and almost instantaneous. \n\nAfter that, Guy decided to take a walk around the RoK and observe if there were any hidden secrets of mechanisms. As he walked further from the centre, the shelves started to become emptier. Evidently, the original body hadn’t read a lot of books. It was a sad sight.\n\nA little further down the shelves, Guy found himself before an impenetrable barrier. Beyond the barrier, he could see shelves that were fully populated, and that too with books he’d read in his previous life. He figured those would be accessible to him once he accomplished those hidden achievements Mast was talking about.\n\nOnce Guy had had enough, he went with his instincts and pulled his consciousness out of the RoK. The process felt different. When before there was a feeling of entering a vacuum, exiting felt like he was being shoved into a pressure vessel. In a quick moment, the sensation dissipated and he found himself back inside his room.\n\nThe room Guy was currently living in was subsidised by his school for its teaching apprentices. It was like a studio apartment, with a small kitchen, bedroom and living room all inside one square space. The building had a shared bathroom on each level. The building itself only had 3 floors but each floor was quite wide, similar to the tube-shaped apartments, and had a rustic feel to it. If Guy was to comment on the design, it felt like old Greek architecture with its decadently designed pillars and open courtyards.\n\nHis room was clean and empty. Apparently, Guy didn’t own a lot of possessions. When Guy peered into the old body’s memories, he found that he truly was alone in this world. His family passed away when he was still 15 years old during a territory dispute between neighbouring fiefs. Being passed from orphanage to orphanage, no wonder the poor guy developed a crushing inferiority complex. This world was not kind to the weak!\n\nGuy decided that it was necessary to fully internalise his body’s old memory. He didn’t want to arouse any suspicion from those that knew this body. He planned to slowly transform into his true self so that it would feel natural to others.\n\nOf all the information Guy internalised, one thing that he paid close attention to was magic and cultivation. Since this was a field completely novel to him, he wanted to make sure that he didn’t miss any detail. He was supposed to be a teacher after all. The worst mistake a teacher can make is to teach something they themselves aren’t sure about. In his experience from his old life, one thing Guy had learned was that an arrogant teacher does more damage to the student than themself.\n\nHis least fond memory from his old life was when Guy was in his Physics classes in high school. Of all the teachers from his old school, the physics teacher was the one that had lasted the longest. Through multiple rounds of restructuring, hiring and firing, that old physics teacher persisted like a weed on concrete. He wondered how the man managed it; he still hadn’t figured it out.\n\nThe physics teacher of his was a good man, but a horrible teacher. He never bothered to update himself on modern advancements in science and always spoke in a matter-of-fact tone. As part of a graduation project, Guy had to work in a subject of choice under a teacher who specialised in it. Since it was his most favourite subject, Guy chose physics and inevitably worked under the old physics teacher.\n\nAs he made progress in his project, Guy never failed to ascertain if the direction he was going in met the criteria and was sufficiently rigorous to meet the marking standards. Every time he asked his supervisor, the physics teacher said that it was all good. \n\nYou can imagine the outcome. Guy completely failed that project and had to redo it. It was at that point when Guy realised the price of arrogance. In fact, when Guy brought it up with his supervisor, the physics teacher just brushed it off and said that it wasn’t his fault.\n\nAnyways. After that experience, Guy swore to himself that if he was to ever teach someone, he would make sure that he was sufficiently knowledgeable about it, and would straightforwardly say that he couldn’t teach them if he didn’t know the subject.\n\nOnce Guy absorbed all the memories from the old body, he went up to the kitchen to fix himself something to eat. There wasn’t much except for a few snacks. Guy didn’t feel like going out to buy anything, and so he chose to fill his stomach on junk food.\n\nAfter he consumed for sustenance, Guy started to peruse the various books stored in the RoK while taking notes. One great feature of the RoK was that there was a computer inside that only had word-processing functionality. That way, Guy could both read and take well-formatted notes at the same time. This was something Guy was thankful for since his own handwriting was horrendous.\n\nAnd that was how Guy spent the rest of his day.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-004]]","n":0.024}}},{"i":216,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 002 - What kind of a System is this?","n":0.316},"1":{"v":"\nGuy Larks died at the age of 33. He thought that was the end of his life, but he was given a second chance! Unfortunately, it was about to get cut short too.\n\n“URK!” Guy’s eyes bulged out as he felt a constricting feeling around his throat. He was getting choked.\n\nIn a state of panic, Guy quickly scanned the area around him to get a better bearing on what was happening. Next to him, he saw a chair, which was a small distance away from his hanging legs. Around his neck was a tight rope, a noose.\n\n‘Holy shit! I’m committing suicide!’\n\nAs Guy struggled, he found the rope tightening. He tried to wriggle his fingers between his throat and the tightening rope to relieve some of the pressure. He then angled his body to get a foothold on the chair nearby.\n\n‘I’m not dying! Not again!’\n\nWith great difficulty, he managed to place his feet on the chair. Without his body weight pressing down on his neck, the impending threat of suffocation was alleviated.\n\nAfter gaining a momentary respite, Guy slowly started to inspect the rope for a way to untie it.\n\n‘Oh thank God it isn’t a Hangman’s knot! Wait, is there a God? Thank Mast?’\n\n(You’re welcome?)\n\n‘Holy shit!’ The sudden voice that spoke inside his head nearly caused Guy to trip. To be safe, Guy very carefully started to shift the chair to a more stable position under his body.\n\nAs Guy untied the knot, he called out to the voice inside his head.\n\n‘Mast is that you?’\n\n(Shhh!)\n\n‘Excu-’\n\n(Shhhhh!)\n\nBefore Guy could verbally retaliate, a sudden pressure descended upon the room. It was as if multiple eyes were peering into every nook and cranny. The weight was especially heavy on Guy, whose palms started to sweat causing the rope to slip continuously.\n\nAfter a minute that seemed to last for an eternity, the pressure lifted.\n\n‘What the hell was that?!’ Guy thought to himself.\n\n(That was my brother. You see I sort of separated this body’s soul and put you in its place. There must have been a discrepancy in the balance sheet so my brother came to check it out. That meticulous bastard!)\n\nGuy finally managed to untie the rope around his neck, and he then collapsed onto the chair underneath his feet. Withstanding that pressure had completely exhausted him.\n\n‘Where the hell am I? Don’t tell me! I got transmigrated into a different world! Hell yeah!’\n\nIn his final years, Guy had nothing to do. In his “free time” he used to read a lot of books. At first, he read academic works in the fields he was interested in. But after some time, it started to get a little boring so he shifted to consuming casual literature such as web-published novels and series. Due to the nature of those works, it was quick to read and didn’t involve much thinking. One of the genres he enjoyed the most was the “transmigrated into a different world” or “isekai” novels. He liked them because he really wanted to be one of those main characters who got a second chance, given how screwed up his current life was.\n\n(Yes. You’re in my brother’s world now. I have this body’s soul with me. Let me transfer all the pertinent information into your head now.)\n\nGuy braced himself for a splitting headache.\n\nHe waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\n‘What the hell? Did you do it yet?’ Guy asked impatiently.\n\n(Yes. I did it a minute ago…)\n\n‘What? I didn’t feel-’ As Guy started to recollect, novel memories materialised inside his head. It was as if these memories were hidden behind closed doors in his psyche, and all he had to do was access them. There was no latency, it was immediate recollection.\n\nThe body he was in had the same name as Guy. \n\n‘At least I don’t have to get used to a new name.’ Guy sighed in relief.\n\nThe world he was in right now was similar to a fantasy world from the middle ages. But there were minor differences. He saw that there were elements of Eastern fantasy in it as well. Especially with regards to how the levels of magic were categorised.\n\n‘What a new and original world! This would be hard to classify in those web-publishing sites.’ Guy commented while staring at the fourth wall in his room.\n\nThe original “Guy Larks” was a Teaching Apprentice in the Radiant Academy - a school for mages. He chose this job because Guy Larks was a massive coward. He didn’t like to fight, and he didn’t want to take any risks in his career. Thus he felt that teaching would be a safe and stable option.\n\nTo pursue this, “Guy” enrolled into his alma mater for a teaching position. To start off he had to work as a Teaching Apprentice. This was basically like a teaching assistant, in which the apprentice had to work under an established teacher and handle some of the teacher’s students. During a two-year-long apprenticeship, the apprentice had to take on his or her own personal student and train them for a year. At the end of the year, the student would compete in an internal tournament. Those apprentices whose students managed to gain the top 50 positions would have a secured job, and those that didn’t would be disqualified.\n\n“Guy” was in high spirits as he started his job. He worked under a new teacher, called “Blevin Hinds”, who didn’t have any apprentices. Usually, the fewer apprentices a teacher had the better it would be for the apprentices. They would be able to gain more experience and would have more resources to work with.\n\nThe teacher he was working under was a little arrogant. Since the former managed to reach the Foundation Establishment realm at the ripe old age of 21, he looked down upon most of his apprentices who were the same age but were still in the middle-to-late stage of Mana Condensation.\n\nOf Guy’s three colleagues, only one was able to meet the teacher’s expectations. Although her accomplishments were well-founded, the envious “Guy” wrote it off as a result of her impressive “assets”. The current Guy shook his head at the original’s bigoted views.\n\n‘Clearly, feminism isn’t a thing in this world…’\n\nGuy and his colleague “Jo Way” were nothing short of pathetic. While Guy was a coward with an inferiority complex, Jo was a show-off. Guy played it safe, but Jo just had to take on more than he could chew and accidentally screwed over the cultivation of one of Teacher Hinds’ students. Following a series of lawsuits and complaints, which in turn resulted in an in-depth investigation into the quality of the hired teaching apprentices, Guy and Jo found themselves on the chopping block.\n\nThe higher-ups increased the stringency of the apprenticeship and made it so that if Guy and Jo couldn’t get a student under them and prepare them for the upcoming internal apprentice tournament, not only would they get fired but they would be blacklisted from applying to another teaching establishment.\n\nGuy, with his inferiority complex, stewed in the misery of not being able to succeed and decided to off himself before even taking a shot at it. His final thoughts were: ‘What’s the point? No one will want to be my student. I’m going to fail anyways…Since I don’t have anyone, no one will even miss me.’\n\nAnd that was where the most recent memory ended.\n\nThe newly transmigrated Guy sighed as he tried to digest all the information he just learned. Which then inevitably led to the question.\n\n‘Why am I in this body?’\n\n(Many reasons actually. First off, I couldn’t put you into a body that attracted too much attention at first, lest my brother takes notice of it. Secondly, I saw that when you died the last time, you wished to teach more students. So I figured this body was perfect for your needs.)\n\n‘That’s true. But there’s one big problem though. My knowledge may not apply to this world. I can already see that there is magic in this universe, which basically changes a lot of things.’\n\n(Hmm. You’re right! Do you have any suggestions?)\n\n‘Well in most books that I read with a similar premise, the person who gets transmigrated gets some sort of a special system.’ Guy responded while scratching his head.\n\n(What’s a system?) Mast inquired.\n\n‘Well, a system is basically like a special ability, power, dimension or cheat that the transmigrator has access to that makes their life easier in some ways.’ Guy answered mentally in his signature “teacher’s voice”.\n\nOver his teaching career, Guy had developed this voice to overcome his naturally sharp tone. Most kids would laugh whenever he spoke normally as he sounded like an adolescent going through puberty. But his teaching voice was deep and gravelly. It commanded respect. Though it basically wrecked his vocal cords. \n\nThankfully this body’s voice wasn’t as sharp as Guy’s from his previous world. Appearance-wice this body was just average in Guy’s opinion. He was now around 1.7m - not too tall or short. His hair was dark brown, the same shade as his eyes - unassuming. Even though this body was only 21, there were crow’s feet and wrinkles forming on his face. Most likely due to the constant stress the coward was under. His facial structure was similar to those from Middle East from his old world. His face was a darker shade of sandy brown and was clean-shaven. The one redeeming quality of his was his sparkling eyes. They radiated wonder and excitement. Too bad the old coward always looked at the floor and hid those gems.\n\nAs for clothing, Guy wore an outfit that adhered to local standards. Cotton based fabric dominated the industry, due to the region’s tropical climate. Guy was also wearing a robe over his shirt and trousers, which had Radiant Academy’s logo, and a blue-white colour scheme.\n\nGuy shook his head and stopped admiring his new appearance. He then asked Mast who was now inside his head, ‘So what’s it going to be?’\n\n(Well since I’m not really human, or a living entity for that matter, I don’t really have any idea about this “system” you talked about. But given that your preferred profession is teaching, I guess giving you some form of help so that you can get started and thrive in the industry is paramount.\n\nBased on an analysis of what is needed from a teacher, and a bunch of other data that I found from my own world and this one, I think this would be perfect~)\n\nGuy pumped his fists inwardly at the thought of having his own system. His golden finger! But his fantasies were cut short as a sudden headache assaulted him. \n\nAfter squirming on his room’s floor for a minute like a salted worm, Guy slowly stood up.\n\n‘What was that Mast?!’ Guy screamed internally. But as he did so he noticed an additional “thing” inside his consciousness. He didn’t know how to describe it, but he could observe it with his mind space. It was a weird feeling.\n\nGuy probed the “thing” and he found himself getting pulled in. When his consciousness cleared up, he found himself inside his old library from his original world.\n\nGuy loved to collect and read a lot of books. In his old world, he had an entire floor filled with books and memorabilia from his travels. The library he was currently inside looked almost exactly like his old one but seemed a lot larger. Not only that, but this library went in all four cardinal directions, endlessly.\n\nAs he was engrossed in the visuals, a hand tapped his shoulders. Guy turned around and found himself facing himself. Not his current self, his old self. The self from his original world.\n\n‘What the hell?’ Guy exclaimed.\n\n(Relax it’s me.) His old body replied.\n\n‘Mast?’ Guy probed, to which his old body nodded.\n\n(I’m using this body because it’s convenient. I don’t want to have to mould a new one, it’s a headache. We world builders aren’t really creative folk. Anyways welcome to your so-called “system”. I like to call it, the -)\n\n‘It’s the Library of Heaven’s Path!’ Guy exclaimed in excitement.\n\n(What? No! It’s the Repository of Knowledge. Call it RoK for short.) Mast shot Guy down unceremoniously.\n\n‘What all can this do? Can I observe people’s weaknesses and find out how to improve their cultivation? Can I figure out the qualities and special abilities of artefacts? Can I develop divine potions?’ Guy rattled off as he indulged himself in his fantasies. \n\n(No.) Mast replied without emotion.\n\n‘No to what?’ Guy probed.\n\n(It doesn’t do any of that.)\n\nGuy’s dreams that were soaring up in the heavens crash-landed. ‘Then what can it do?’\n\n(Basically, this Repository holds all the books that you’ve read from your old world, and all the books this current body has read in this world.) Mast started getting excited. He had actually looked into some RPG games from his world when he made this Repository. (Well I haven’t included ALL the knowledge from your old world. They’re behind barriers that will open up when you accomplish certain achievements.)\n\nGuy, who was not completely downcast, decided to hold on to some hope and asked, ‘So does this mean I can recollect any of my old knowledge instantly?’\n\n(No. If you want to access knowledge that is in these books, you obviously have to read them.)\n\nAnd then there was pin-drop silence.\n\n‘WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM IS THIS?’ Guy’s voice echoed across the RoK.\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-003]]\n","n":0.021}}},{"i":217,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 001 - A Life Cut Short","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\nLuck is something that truly exists in this world. Regardless of how hard someone works, luck inevitably plays a crucial role in their success. A man can work his ass off through college and university and still end up working as a peon, or a man can cruise through easy courses and end up with a lucky internship in a mega-corporation from the get-go.\n\nIn many ways, luck can make or break someone’s future.\n\nGuy Larks was a special case. He was born with heavenly fortune - to a family with wealth oozing out of their pores - and that too in the most favourable position, as the youngest of three siblings. His eldest brother - now 30 years old- would inevitably inherit the Larks family’s multi-billion dollar business, and the middle sister - now 27 years old- was successful in the art business and had a growing entertainment corporation. His parents did not have any expectations from him, and he was free to live a prodigal life as an 18-year-old.\n\nBut Guy Larks didn’t. Even with all the wealth, his parents lived a traditional life. From a young age, the siblings were brought up personally by their parents and grandparents. This in turn inculcated strict morals in the three kids. His eldest brother remained chaste until his marriage at the age of 27, and his sister was still in a long-running relationship with her college girlfriend, now turned business partner. \n\nAlthough Guy was never under any pressure from his family to achieve anything, he still wanted to make some impact in society. And thus as soon as he graduated from high school, he started travelling the world doing charitable work in third-world countries and regions of conflict. Initially, his travel had a selfish motive to bring his family into the spotlight. But as he saw the struggles of the folk he met through his travels, his psyche started to change. He truly wanted to help them.\n\nAt the age of 20, Guy enrolled into the top university in the field of teaching and pedagogy and worked himself to the bone to finally gain a complete Master’s degree within 4 years. Following that, he started to revisit the places he went to before and started to improve the logistics in the impoverished nations. Building wells, better sanitation, sustainable housing, and finally better educational facility.\n\nWith that he started to go around the world teaching in different places, meeting kids from all walks of life. Over time he realised that teaching was his greatest passion, something he wished to pursue for the rest of his life.\n\nGuy Larks had accumulated a lot of good karma in his life.\n\nBut surprisingly, at the age of 30, the still single Guy Larks found out that he had cancer. It would have been fine if it was a cancer of a single organ. Since with all of the family’s wealth, treatment would have been a piece of cake. However, Guy had cancer of the lungs, liver and breast.\n\nFor someone who had never indulged in any vices, this was a massive blow. What of all the good deed he’d done in his lifetime? The poor guy was also about to die a virgin!\n\nGuy was a little enraged about it. While he wasn’t religious, he still started to curse all the gods and goddesses from various pantheons for the misfortune ‘blessed’ upon him. But as time passed he started to come to terms with his illnesses and decided that death was the less painful option as opposed to undergoing a battery of toxic treatments.\n\nGuy would have died as a baleful spirit, if not for what happened as he lay in his death bed. In his final two years, all the kids and teens he’d helped over his charitable travels came over to offer their prayers and love. With every child he met, Guy finally realised the amount of impact he made in this world. His greatest fear, that his life would be wasted, was alleviated.\n\nAnd so with his dying breath, Guy’s last words weren’t a string of curses on the unfairness of the world, but the following: “I wish I could continue teaching…”\n\nAt the age of 33, Guy Larks died.\n\n(What a wonderful life. You should see what the others, who were in your exact position, did in their lifetime.)\n\n‘Wait! I didn’t die?’ \n\nGuy found his consciousness in an endless void. He looked down and found that he was just a disembodied wisp.\n\n(You did. What you’re seeing is your soul.)\n\n‘What’s happening to me? Is reincarnation real? Is this purgatory? Wait! is religion real?’\n\n(Woah! Woah! Chill! Let me introduce myself. My name is &#%@*.)\n\n‘Huh?’\n\n(Oh right! You can call me Mast. My name has multiple dimensions to it, for beings such as yourself, it will only sound like gibberish. You’re the first human I’m talking to, so I sort of forgot.)\n\nA burst of mirthful laughter resonated across the void.\n\n‘Why am I here Mr. Mast?’\n\n(No need to be so polite with me. Your predicament was partially my fault, so I don’t deserve your respect.) Mast spoke with a crestfallen tone.\n\n‘Your fault?’\n\n(Well you see, what you did was a little special. With all the good work that you did, you unknowingly disseminated your abundant good luck and absorbed all the bad luck of the people you interacted with.)\n\n‘You can do that?’\n\n(It’s a statistic in my world you see. Usually, when people do charity work, there is usually a middle-man who is somewhat disconnected from the charity work. This way while good luck is disseminated, it is not absorbed by the donating party. Moreover, not many people of massive fortune tend to get so personally ingrained into their charity work. The work that you did personally, and the scale of it, was truly massive.)\n\n‘Wait does that mean doing charity work is bad?’\n\n(Well not technically. Doing charity work is the best way to disseminate good luck, so the more people do it the better. You on the other hand did it all personally - that’s the keyword - compared to others. And the level of work you did was well beyond the scale of other charitable organisations on Earth.)\n\nGuy nodded, causing the wisp to bob in place. At the end of his life, he read a few news articles that ran a complicated algorithmic analysis that qualitatively assessed the impact of the various charitable organisations. And his name was miles ahead of others.\n\nAs he absorbed all the information, Guy started to laugh self-deprecatingly. All the good work that he did caused his death. How ironic…\n\n(Now, now. Since it was my fault that you died, and since you brought to light a significant oversight in my world’s programming, I would like to offer you some form of compensation.)\n\n‘Compensation?’\n\n(Yes. I’m going to offer you a second opportunity.)\n\n‘Awesome! I can be with my family again!’\n\n(Not really. I can’t send you back into my world. I’m not allowed to do that. I am what you call a world builder. The stability of the world I tend to will determine whether I live or not. The world you’re from is one that I made. As a builder all I’m allowed to do is make minor changes to the laws of the worlds, micromanaging can lead to significant deviations.)\n\n‘Then how will I get a second opportunity?’\n\nA  devious chuckle reverberated throughout the void. (You see, my elder brother just started a new world. His first world is pretty stable so he technically has a backup. You get what I’m saying?)\n\n‘You want to mess up his new world?’\n\n(No! I’m just “contributing” by doing what you people call beta-testing his new world.) Mast chuckled.\n\n‘Hmm. Whatever you say…’ Guy replied sarcastically.\n\n(Anyway, here’s the plan. I’m going to transplant your soul into another compatible body in his world. How does that sound?)\n\n‘Well, it sucks that I won’t get to meet my parents. But what you suggested does sound fun.’ The still virgin Guy’s mind wandered into some special places as he finished that thought.\n\n(Yes. I know how you humans like to perform acts of procreation for pleasure.)\n\nGuy’s wispy body turned a vibrant shade of red.\n\n(So what do you say? Wanna do it?)\n\nGuy pondered on it for a while. Although at the end he felt that his life was fulfilling, when he thought back to it, there were a lot of things he wanted to accomplish that he never got the opportunity to do. Since Mast was offering an opportunity for a second chance, Guy felt that there was no loss. He already lived one life. Since he was getting a second one as a freebie, he wouldn’t mind. \n\nSo without hesitating any longer, Guy affirmed. ‘Sure. I want that second chance.’\n\n(Wonderful!)\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n‘Hello?’\n\n(Wait! I’m searching for a spot where my brother isn’t paying attention.)\n\n‘OK.’\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n‘Umm. Is there anything I can do here? I’m a little -’\n\nWHOOSH\n\n____\n\n**Next**\n* [[volume-1.chapter-002]]\n","n":0.026}}},{"i":218,"$":{"0":{"v":"Miscellaneous","n":1}}},{"i":219,"$":{"0":{"v":"Grades","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Cultivation Methods\n\n#### Common Grade\n\nThe Common methods are the lowest tiers. \n\nThey are basic and can at most allow a mage to reach Core Formation Realm. They are basic as their contents touch on topics superficially, and hence the insights that can be gained from those methods are limited.\n\nThese work for 80-90% of the population.\n\n#### Advanced Grade\n\nHigher than Common method and can provide more insights. They are generally a continuation or expansion of Common methods and can usually carry the mage through their entire cultivation journey. Within the Common and Advanced tier, there are implicit subdivisions that depend on the specificity, relatability, applicability, and similar factors pertaining thot he method itself.\n\n\n#### Specialised Grade\n\nTailored to specific individuals, bloodlines, physiques, or even species. Depending on the applicability, that is the number of people that can use the method, the cultivation methods can have a higher rarity.\n\n\n#### Ancestral Grade\n\nPassed down from generation to generation. These can be restricted to specific clans, sects or organisations. These are highly guarded and are passed down personally.\n\n\n## Enchanted Weapons\n\n#### Common Grade\n\nSingle enchantment.\n\n#### Unique Grade\n\nMore than two enchantments.\n\n#### Epic Grade\n\nCan grow stronger over use.\n\n#### Legendary Grade\n\nHave psuedo-sentience, like a nascent will\n\n## Spells\n\nd","n":0.072}}},{"i":220,"$":{"0":{"v":"Cultivation Levels","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n## Mana Condensation\n\nEvery human has nascent mana well. It is small at first and it can be grown using two main methods. Either using the mana for spells, that pushes it to its limits or to use cultivation methods.\n\n- **Early** - Can perform cantrips (i.e. non-elementally aligned and simple magic. Does not stress the channels.)\n- **Middle** - Can perform Tier-1 spells with minimum elemental alignment\n- **Late**\n\nPerfected resonance is an indicator that a mage is ready to breakthrough into Foundation Establishment\n\n## Foundation Establishment\n\nTo enter Foundation Establishment, one must have a cultivation method that resonates with them in some way. Cultivation methods give insights into their selves that helps them to develop a foundation in a concept or idea that speaks to them and form a Mana Body. People in this stage can perform Tier-2 to Tier-4 spells depending on their capacities (or boosts due to special physiques and bloodlines).\n\n- **Base (Mana Pond)** - Reinforcing blood vessels\n- **Internal (Mana Lake)** - Reinforcing internal organs and skeletal structure\n- **External (Mana Sea)** - Reinforcing skin, muscles and external organs\n\n\n## Core Formation\n\nForming a core is the first step into transforming the base human into a post-human. Core Formation mages are no longer considered their base species. For beasts, the Core Formation gives them the ability to obtain a new form of their own choosing that aligns with their foundation. Furthermore, metamorphed species can reproduce with any other metamorphed species in Core Formation only. This gives rise to special bloodlines and special physiques that manifest in full power when the offspring hits Core Formation stage.\n\nFor other humanoid species:\n\n- Elves --> High-Elves | Dark-Elves | Wood-Elves | Mers | Fae; \n- Dwarves --> Ashfire Dwarves | Bluesteel Dwarves;\n\nHumans do not have a prefixed metamorphosis lineage, there is openness here. But due to lack of such a pathway, it is harded for humans to hit Core Formation. Core Formation mages can use Tier-4 to Tier-6 spells, with some special species able to hit Tier-7 of any specific elemental or non-elemental flavoured spells that resonate with their cores.\n\n- **First Half (Fold mana sea to form a 3D schematic)** - Forming schematic of what the core will be. This core will have a functionality pertaining to the foundation (eg. to infuse flammability to mana, make mana more receptive to metals etc.)\n- **Second Half (Materialise the 3D schematic into functioning skeletal structure)** - Forming the skeleton will now allow the mage to utilise basic functions of the core. Once the skeletal structure is fully stabilised, the ‘World’ will inspect it and see if it is viable by attacking it with a tribulation of varying types.\n\n\n## Core Condensation\nCore condensation stage is achieved after undegoing a tribulation. These can be physical or mental. The focus of the tribulation is to decipher a weakness in the mage’s core and foundation and attack it. If the core destabilises the mage has to start again in making a core. If the foundation destabilises the mage dies. \n\nCore condensation has only 1 stage and that is to infuse new insights into the skeletal core to make it into a fully formed self-sustaining 3D structure.\n\nCore condensation mages can user Tier-7 to Tier-8 spells with specialists able to use Tier-9 spells.\n\n\n## Tesseract Transformation\nTo enter tesseract transformation stage, the core must be shattered and expanded. This process is painful and is a tribulation the mage chooses to do upon them selves. \n\nTo form a tesseract, the mage must peer into their souls (which is possible once core is condensed) and pull it out of their body and merge it with their cores. This is the end point of cultivation because now the mage has reached liberation.\n\nAt this point the mage’s physical and magical strength becomes stagnant, but they can advance their souls by performing introspections. As long as the soul is not stagnant, the mage can live to eternity.\n\nTesseract Transformation experts can perform Tier-9 and above spells.\n\n\n## Ascension\nmages that no longer want to continue advancing can choose to ascend. This is the process of pulling their tesseracts out of their body and affixing it to a point in the material world. The tesseract creates a tear in space that forms a new dimension.\n\nThe dimension is a mini world that is built upon the mage’s years of gaining insights, and is an opportunity for other mages to peer into the mage’s soul and gain some insights themselves.\n\nMost ascended mages tend to form inheritence grounds that hold both material and immaterial rewards accumulated by the ascended during their lifetimes, to give to potential contestants. The ascended can also attach their consciousness to potentiates and help them in growing as well.\n\nTo ascend is the death of the mage’s physical tether, while the psyche is tethered to the dimension. These dimensions can be destroyed as well, but requires efforts from a lot of Tesseract Transformation experts.\n\n## Other Details\nMage’s base age multiplies by 1.5 to 2 every stage until Tesseract Transformation where they are essentially immortal.\n\n> So for humans:\n> - Mana Condensation: 150 - 200 years\n> - Foundation Establishment: 300-400 years\n> - Core Formation: 600-800 years\n> - Core Condensation: 1200-1600 years\n> - Tesseract Transformation: N/A\n> - Ascension: Psychic Immortality\n\nOther species have different base age limits so the extension differs. But for those with higher base age limits, advancing is harder.","n":0.034}}},{"i":221,"$":{"0":{"v":"Introduction","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance!

This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n","n":0.052}}}]}
