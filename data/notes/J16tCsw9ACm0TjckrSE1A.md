## Mana Condensation

Every human has nascent mana well. It is small at first and it can be grown using two main methods. Either using the mana for spells, that pushes it to its limits or to use cultivation methods.

- **Early** - Can perform cantrips (i.e. non-elementally aligned and simple magic. Does not stress the channels.)
- **Middle** - Can perform Tier-1 spells with minimum elemental alignment
- **Late**

Perfected resonance is an indicator that a mage is ready to breakthrough into Foundation Establishment

## Foundation Establishment

To enter Foundation Establishment, one must have a cultivation method that resonates with them in some way. Cultivation methods give insights into their selves that helps them to develop a foundation in a concept or idea that speaks to them and form a Mana Body. People in this stage can perform Tier-2 to Tier-4 spells depending on their capacities (or boosts due to special physiques and bloodlines).

- **Base (Mana Pond)** - Reinforcing blood vessels
- **Internal (Mana Lake)** - Reinforcing internal organs and skeletal structure
- **External (Mana Sea)** - Reinforcing skin, muscles and external organs


## Core Formation

Forming a core is the first step into transforming the base human into a post-human. Core Formation mages are no longer considered their base species. For beasts, the Core Formation gives them the ability to obtain a new form of their own choosing that aligns with their foundation. Furthermore, metamorphed species can reproduce with any other metamorphed species in Core Formation only. This gives rise to special bloodlines and special physiques that manifest in full power when the offspring hits Core Formation stage.

For other humanoid species:

- Elves --> High-Elves | Dark-Elves | Wood-Elves | Mers | Fae; 
- Dwarves --> Ashfire Dwarves | Bluesteel Dwarves;

Humans do not have a prefixed metamorphosis lineage, there is openness here. But due to lack of such a pathway, it is harded for humans to hit Core Formation. Core Formation mages can use Tier-4 to Tier-6 spells, with some special species able to hit Tier-7 of any specific elemental or non-elemental flavoured spells that resonate with their cores.

- **First Half (Fold mana sea to form a 3D schematic)** - Forming schematic of what the core will be. This core will have a functionality pertaining to the foundation (eg. to infuse flammability to mana, make mana more receptive to metals etc.)
- **Second Half (Materialise the 3D schematic into functioning skeletal structure)** - Forming the skeleton will now allow the mage to utilise basic functions of the core. Once the skeletal structure is fully stabilised, the ‘World’ will inspect it and see if it is viable by attacking it with a tribulation of varying types.


## Core Condensation
Core condensation stage is achieved after undegoing a tribulation. These can be physical or mental. The focus of the tribulation is to decipher a weakness in the mage’s core and foundation and attack it. If the core destabilises the mage has to start again in making a core. If the foundation destabilises the mage dies. 

Core condensation has only 1 stage and that is to infuse new insights into the skeletal core to make it into a fully formed self-sustaining 3D structure.

Core condensation mages can user Tier-7 to Tier-8 spells with specialists able to use Tier-9 spells.


## Tesseract Transformation
To enter tesseract transformation stage, the core must be shattered and expanded. This process is painful and is a tribulation the mage chooses to do upon them selves. 

To form a tesseract, the mage must peer into their souls (which is possible once core is condensed) and pull it out of their body and merge it with their cores. This is the end point of cultivation because now the mage has reached liberation.

At this point the mage’s physical and magical strength becomes stagnant, but they can advance their souls by performing introspections. As long as the soul is not stagnant, the mage can live to eternity.

Tesseract Transformation experts can perform Tier-9 and above spells.


## Ascension
mages that no longer want to continue advancing can choose to ascend. This is the process of pulling their tesseracts out of their body and affixing it to a point in the material world. The tesseract creates a tear in space that forms a new dimension.

The dimension is a mini world that is built upon the mage’s years of gaining insights, and is an opportunity for other mages to peer into the mage’s soul and gain some insights themselves.

Most ascended mages tend to form inheritence grounds that hold both material and immaterial rewards accumulated by the ascended during their lifetimes, to give to potential contestants. The ascended can also attach their consciousness to potentiates and help them in growing as well.

To ascend is the death of the mage’s physical tether, while the psyche is tethered to the dimension. These dimensions can be destroyed as well, but requires efforts from a lot of Tesseract Transformation experts.

## Other Details
Mage’s base age multiplies by 1.5 to 2 every stage until Tesseract Transformation where they are essentially immortal.

> So for humans:
> - Mana Condensation: 150 - 200 years
> - Foundation Establishment: 300-400 years
> - Core Formation: 600-800 years
> - Core Condensation: 1200-1600 years
> - Tesseract Transformation: N/A
> - Ascension: Psychic Immortality

Other species have different base age limits so the extension differs. But for those with higher base age limits, advancing is harder.
