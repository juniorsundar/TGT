<p>Every human has nascent mana well. It is small at first and it can be grown using two main methods. Either using the mana for spells, that pushes it to its limits or to use cultivation methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early</strong> - Can perform cantrips (i.e. non-elementally aligned and simple magic. Does not stress the channels.)</li>
<li><strong>Middle</strong> - Can perform Tier-1 spells with minimum elemental alignment</li>
<li><strong>Late</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Perfected resonance is an indicator that a mage is ready to breakthrough into Foundation Establishment</p>
<h2 id="foundation-establishment"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#foundation-establishment"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Foundation Establishment</h2>
<p>To enter Foundation Establishment, one must have a cultivation method that resonates with them in some way. Cultivation methods give insights into their selves that helps them to develop a foundation in a concept or idea that speaks to them and form a Mana Body. People in this stage can perform Tier-2 to Tier-4 spells depending on their capacities (or boosts due to special physiques and bloodlines).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base (Mana Pond)</strong> - Reinforcing blood vessels</li>
<li><strong>Internal (Mana Lake)</strong> - Reinforcing internal organs and skeletal structure</li>
<li><strong>External (Mana Sea)</strong> - Reinforcing skin, muscles and external organs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="core-formation"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#core-formation"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Core Formation</h2>
<p>Forming a core is the first step into transforming the base human into a post-human. Core Formation mages are no longer considered their base species. For beasts, the Core Formation gives them the ability to obtain a new form of their own choosing that aligns with their foundation. Furthermore, metamorphed species can reproduce with any other metamorphed species in Core Formation only. This gives rise to special bloodlines and special physiques that manifest in full power when the offspring hits Core Formation stage.</p>
<p>For other humanoid species:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elves --> High-Elves | Dark-Elves | Wood-Elves | Mers | Fae; </li>
<li>Dwarves --> Ashfire Dwarves | Bluesteel Dwarves;</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans do not have a prefixed metamorphosis lineage, there is openness here. But due to lack of such a pathway, it is harded for humans to hit Core Formation. Core Formation mages can use Tier-4 to Tier-6 spells, with some special species able to hit Tier-7 of any specific elemental or non-elemental flavoured spells that resonate with their cores.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Half (Fold mana sea to form a 3D schematic)</strong> - Forming schematic of what the core will be. This core will have a functionality pertaining to the foundation (eg. to infuse flammability to mana, make mana more receptive to metals etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Second Half (Materialise the 3D schematic into functioning skeletal structure)</strong> - Forming the skeleton will now allow the mage to utilise basic functions of the core. Once the skeletal structure is fully stabilised, the ‘World’ will inspect it and see if it is viable by attacking it with a tribulation of varying types.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="core-condensation"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#core-condensation"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Core Condensation</h2>
<p>Core condensation stage is achieved after undegoing a tribulation. These can be physical or mental. The focus of the tribulation is to decipher a weakness in the mage’s core and foundation and attack it. If the core destabilises the mage has to start again in making a core. If the foundation destabilises the mage dies. </p>
<p>Core condensation has only 1 stage and that is to infuse new insights into the skeletal core to make it into a fully formed self-sustaining 3D structure.</p>
<p>Core condensation mages can user Tier-7 to Tier-8 spells with specialists able to use Tier-9 spells.</p>
<h2 id="tesseract-transformation"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#tesseract-transformation"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Tesseract Transformation</h2>
<p>To enter tesseract transformation stage, the core must be shattered and expanded. This process is painful and is a tribulation the mage chooses to do upon them selves. </p>
<p>To form a tesseract, the mage must peer into their souls (which is possible once core is condensed) and pull it out of their body and merge it with their cores. This is the end point of cultivation because now the mage has reached liberation.</p>
<p>At this point the mage’s physical and magical strength becomes stagnant, but they can advance their souls by performing introspections. As long as the soul is not stagnant, the mage can live to eternity.</p>
<p>Tesseract Transformation experts can perform Tier-9 and above spells.</p>
<h2 id="ascension"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#ascension"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Ascension</h2>
<p>mages that no longer want to continue advancing can choose to ascend. This is the process of pulling their tesseracts out of their body and affixing it to a point in the material world. The tesseract creates a tear in space that forms a new dimension.</p>
<p>The dimension is a mini world that is built upon the mage’s years of gaining insights, and is an opportunity for other mages to peer into the mage’s soul and gain some insights themselves.</p>
<p>Most ascended mages tend to form inheritence grounds that hold both material and immaterial rewards accumulated by the ascended during their lifetimes, to give to potential contestants. The ascended can also attach their consciousness to potentiates and help them in growing as well.</p>
<p>To ascend is the death of the mage’s physical tether, while the psyche is tethered to the dimension. These dimensions can be destroyed as well, but requires efforts from a lot of Tesseract Transformation experts.</p>
<h2 id="other-details"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#other-details"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Other Details</h2>
<p>Mage’s base age multiplies by 1.5 to 2 every stage until Tesseract Transformation where they are essentially immortal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So for humans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mana Condensation: 150 - 200 years</li>
<li>Foundation Establishment: 300-400 years</li>
<li>Core Formation: 600-800 years</li>
<li>Core Condensation: 1200-1600 years</li>
<li>Tesseract Transformation: N/A</li>
<li>Ascension: Psychic Immortality</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Other species have different base age limits so the extension differs. But for those with higher base age limits, advancing is harder.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#mana-condensation" title="Mana Condensation">Mana Condensation</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#foundation-establishment" title="Foundation Establishment">Foundation Establishment</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#core-formation" title="Core Formation">Core Formation</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#core-condensation" title="Core Condensation">Core Condensation</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#tesseract-transformation" title="Tesseract Transformation">Tesseract Transformation</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#ascension" title="Ascension">Ascension</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#other-details" title="Other Details">Other Details</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></section></section></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"J16tCsw9ACm0TjckrSE1A","title":"Cultivation Levels","desc":"","updated":1643658051770,"created":1643658012311,"custom":{},"fname":"miscellaneous.cultivation-levels","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"be3ae386a7baa74f1df556b12e7549c5","links":[],"anchors":{"mana-condensation":{"type":"header","text":"Mana Condensation","value":"mana-condensation","line":8,"column":0,"depth":2},"foundation-establishment":{"type":"header","text":"Foundation Establishment","value":"foundation-establishment","line":18,"column":0,"depth":2},"core-formation":{"type":"header","text":"Core Formation","value":"core-formation","line":27,"column":0,"depth":2},"core-condensation":{"type":"header","text":"Core Condensation","value":"core-condensation","line":42,"column":0,"depth":2},"tesseract-transformation":{"type":"header","text":"Tesseract Transformation","value":"tesseract-transformation","line":50,"column":0,"depth":2},"ascension":{"type":"header","text":"Ascension","value":"ascension","line":60,"column":0,"depth":2},"other-details":{"type":"header","text":"Other Details","value":"other-details","line":69,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":[],"parent":"fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"cultivation-levels\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#cultivation-levels\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCultivation Levels\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"mana-condensation\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#mana-condensation\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMana Condensation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery human has nascent mana well.

A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enableSmartRefs":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"assetsPrefix":"/TGT","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["home","miscellaneous","volume-1","volume-2","volume-3"],"enableSiteLastModified":true,"siteRootDir":"docs","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundar.github.io","enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"writeStubs":false,"seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enablePrettyLinks":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"home"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"J16tCsw9ACm0TjckrSE1A"},"buildId":"gqt0Q281inJJlTCBVPjXF","assetPrefix":"/TGT","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
