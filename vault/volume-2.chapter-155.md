'Do you enjoy living a passive life?' The other Guy mocked. 'Rolling with the flow, avoiding conflicts, living a life devoid of meaning. A negligible existence.'

Guy remained stoic at the barrage of criticisms.

'You don't deserve this second opportunity. You don't deserve The Church. MY CHURCH!' The other Guy continued. 'Look at what you've accomplished with its power? Absolutely nothing!'

'I've assisted my student-' Guy pointed out, however he was immediately interrupted by his counterpart.

'Have you?!' The other Guy jabbed. 'You were handed a supercomputer capable of mapping stars, yet you use it to perform trivial additions. You've barely scratched the surface; there is so much more to extent of The Church's power. Does it satisfy you to wander near the periphery?'

'I'm trying-'

'You're surviving, when you could be thriving. This is the kind of person you are, weak-willed, submissive, comprimising.'

'I am not like that,' Guy tried to rebuke weakly.

'Aren't you? Look back at your life. Not just this one, but the one before,' the other Guy urged. 'For all you've done, have you achieved anything substantial?'

'I have!' Guy responded. 'Our work has positively affected so many people accross the world.'

'You tried to curb the flow of the river with a dam, when you could have rerouted it entirely,' the other Guy commented. 'You were the son of one the most powerful families in the entire world. You had the capacity to lobby for substantial change at a global scale. However, you were unwilling to square up against parties that opposed your agenda to bring about this positive change. You were unwilling to put your foot down and demand for a revolution. You compromised, Guy!'

'That was the best way. Introducing disruptive change to a foreign environment isn't long-lasting and sustainable. And if the local government and organisations oppose the changes, there is little guarantee that they will be propagated,' Guy reasoned. 'I had to take a gentle approach.'

'What do you think happened after your departure?' The other Guy sighed. 'Just like water flows from high to low, the places you left after introducing your non-disruptive change most likely reverted to their old ways.'

'You're saying that I should have been more imposing?' Guy retorted. 'Enforce my so-called "revolutionary" and "right" views to the culturally diverse places I visited? How different would I be from the colonists of the past who did the same and devastated the indigenous and blooming societies? It isn't right to foist my own values upon a society that nurtures another of values.'

'Those that cannot adapt to change, must succumb,' the other Guy highlighted with a disdainful sneer. 'That is one of the Absolute Truths of the world, that has sustained through millenium. It is what caused the extinction of dinosaurs, and pushed humans from one of the weakest to the most dominant species on the planet. These people that you talk about cling to the old ways mired in falsehoods and lies, wasn't it your responsibility as the enlightened to disperse this treacherous fog?!'

'At the cost of losing their heritage and traditions?' Guy retaliation. 'I don't think so.'

The other Guy walked over to the family of three, frozen in grayscale, and nudged his chin towards them, 'What about them? You promised that you would save them, didn't you? You promised to help them live a better life. What of it? Aren't they also victims of the so-called "traditions" you're so desperately trying to preserve?'

'They...'

'THEY ALL DIED!' The other Guy bellowed. 'Borne in an environment where women are viewed as inferior, meant to serve men, what did you expect would happen? Your attempt to bring in law and order through the established system accomplished nothing. The wife died the day after the surgery due to accumulated internal injuries from years of withstanding domestic abuse and lack of proper healthcare in such a remote region. Left with no other guardian, the young girl was isolated with her abusive father who killed her in a fit of drunken rage. The baby girl was then drowned in the river, killed within weeks of birth.'

'It is the result of a regressed mentality. An exception rather than the rule,' Guy tried to argue without conviction. 

'Are you trying to justify the death of three innocents?' the other Guy retorted in disbelief.

'No! I...'

'Take a look at yourself!' The other Guy scolded.

'But the man was punished by the full extent of the law.' Guy flinched lightly as he finished that statement. The other Guy had unearthed a memory that he had suppressed a long time back.
