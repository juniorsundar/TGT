'Not this either,' Markus pondered with his eyes closed. He was currently sitting in a cross-legged posture in his room. He'd entered seclusion a week back, and had effectively shut himself off from all outside communication. Markus could feel tha the was at the cusp of a breakthrough. It was so close he could grab it, but it was yet to enter his reach. To bridge this gap, Markus considered a long-standing tradition amongst cultivators nearing advancement: Closed-Door Cultivation.

Usually, the phrase closed-door is a placeholder implying isolation from all forms of intrusions and disturbances. It means to espouse an optimal environment for a cultivator to piece together scattered insights to develop new, more robust ones and as a result achieve a breakthrough in their cultivation. It didn't necessitate foregoing nourishment as it was often counterproductive to the assimilation process.

However, Markus wasn't having any of it. From his first steps into his arduous cultivation journey, Markus had realised one fact, which was that he wasn't gifted with talent. Every success he'd achieved was through gruelling effort and grinding. Only those gifted with genius level comprehension skills, special physiques or bloodlines, monumental inheritances, or support from powerful structures like sects, clans and organisations could get away with the standard seclusion methods. He was not afforded that luxury.

Hence, Markus completely isolated himself from everything, and delved deeper and deeper into his own thoughts. He could not afford to be distracted, so he started to forcefully slow down his metabolism and completely shut off most non-essential bodily functions, especially his senses. He then set up a thin layer of mana around his skin to reduce water wastage, slowed down his heart rate. He forcefully entered a comatose state where only his brain operated with its full functionality intact.

This technique should not be possible for a Mana Condensation realm mage who is yet to properly comprehend their body. However, thanks to Markus' Junior Sister and his Master's teachings, he was able to gain a better understanding of the human anatomy. Then, with collaborative experiments with his Junior Sister, Markus determined the extent of abuse he could put his body through before incurring horrible consequences.

After reaching a state of complete isolation, Markus started to summarise his insights and planned his next steps. The reason he felt close to breaking through, he concluded, most likely had to do with the fact that he was getting close to replicating Gaige's attack. That spell was the bottleneck to his advancement. However, Markus was also feeling conflicted. He had tried countless approaches to the spell, only to end up short in the last step. For every step taken, he ended up returning to where he started off from.

Markus determined that his dogged venture to create a contingency for his first public loss had been an exercise in futility. Was he wasting his time all along?

But upon aggregating everything he had learned till now in his comatose state, Markus came face to face with the sheer quantity of insights housed in his mind, all of which had been accumulated within a short span of two years. He WAS in fact wasting his time because he hadn't taken a step back to observe the problem with a broader lens. Now that he had done so, Markus zeroed in on the optimal solution to his bottleneck.

His inspiration was drawn from the way Marie achieved her breakthrough, and it had to do with how he perceived the world he lived in. When scientists conduct experiments, one of the thing they need to determine is the variable or characteristic that they intend to measure or observe. One cannot start an experiment if they don't have a way to measure the results of changing the independent variable. Hence sensors, tools, and measuring equipment are an absolute prerequisite to any scientific endeavour.

All this time, Markus had been going about his "experiments" without this key ingredient. He had no way to gauge the accuracy of his recreation of Gaige's attack. On that note, he had not gauge of Gaige's original attack to act as a basis for comparison. Hence Markus opted to use another basis that was familiar to him and vividly embedded into his memories: the vision of the black hole.

Often times, Markus would reminesce about his observation of that unfathomable monstrosity during his meditation sessions. Interestingly, he could easily recollect every single detail. It was exactly like how a martial artist could retaliate an attack through muscle memory alone.

Therefore, Markus first started his closed-door cultivation by perfectly recreating his memory of the black hole. He wanted to relive it, deconstruct it down to the minutiae and figure out a more direct way to observe it without the use of his natural sensors. Markus figured that if he could achieve this goal, he could augment his spells further.

The high-gravity phenomenon formed in his mind gradually. Deprived of every other external distraction, the comatose Markus managed to essentially regress back to the time he was first dropped into the virtual reality experience. He started with the complete vision, and then from it, he incrementally deducted the inputs captured by his natural senses. As he expected, even without them, he could feel "something". It suprised him how his memories could grasp details that were beyond the limits of his senses, this wasn't something that was naturally possible.

When someone recollects a memory, the information is firmly tethered to key points captured by their senses. But in this case, Markus' memory reached to realms bordering on extrasensory. He figured that it may be a quirk of his Master's special |Soul Imprint|. But this was good, he could now flex his mana senses to filter through different sensory data. Markus lacked the ability to abstract information in his mind like Marie, thus he could only brute force through the inputs in hopes of stumbling upon an answer.

A week passed like that. Markus' mana senses would isolate a sensory bandwidth, apply it to the memory of the black hole and observe for any relevant inputs. Most of the time, he was unsuccessful. Once or twice, he managed to capture something faintly, but Markus did not pursue it further as his goal wasn't to follow a pointless tangent. Whatever he was looking for wouldn't be faint. It would blare at him!

'This isn't it,' Markus repeated. 'Next one.'

Markus makes a breakthrough

Figures out that everything is related.

Gravity affects space and time.

Space and time is a net.

Markus starts seeing this. Inspired by how Marie observed the world.

In his enlightened state, he grasps at the strings and manages to float in midair before falling down in exhaustion (he is nude.)

His ability is different from how Gaige did it. But it feels more targeted.
