Markus makes a breakthrough

Figures out that everything is related.

Gravity affects space and time.

Space and time is a net.

Markus starts seeing this. Inspired by how Marie observed the world.

In his enlightened state, he grasps at the strings and manages to float in midair before falling down in exhaustion (he is nude.)

His ability is different from how Gaige did it. But it feels more targeted.
