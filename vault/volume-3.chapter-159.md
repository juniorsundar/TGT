Markus meets with Al and Jean.

Al was already with Jean. They were talking about her recent advancement.

Markus congratulates Jean.

Jean is still embarrassed about that day when she walked in on Markus naked. He explains that it wasn't on purpose. Al jokes that like-master-like-disciple.

Al then congratulates Markus.

Markus inquires about Master Larks.

Al explains how Guy was checked out since that day. Maybe he is in closed-door cultivation? [Impolite to peek]

Al switches topic to inquire about Markus' cultivation method.

Markus explains that he still doesn't understand. He talks about the events that led to and followed his advancement. The insights.

Markus then asks Al to |Extrospect| and decipher his cultivation method.

Al is apprehensive. He doesn't want to hurt himself like last time, especially since Guy isn't here.

Al then points out that both Jean and Markus managed to achieve perfected resonance when neither of them had an established cultivation method. Talk about what that implies.

Al expounds that interestingly, neither of their cultivation feel the same either.

Knowingly or unknowingly, they had cultivated.

Jean comments that the result may just be a coincidence. Besides, they only have two people to go off of.

Markus affirms. They need a larger test pool. What is the common denominator.
