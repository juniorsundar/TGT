Al hummed in thought before saying, "If I had to put it into words, then your cultivation has a vastness, all-encompassing feeling to it."

He then turned to Jean and added, "While yours is more measured, precise and focused. It also feels spotless."

"That's not helpful," Markus commented while shaking his head. "What if we compare our insights? What we observed and assimilated that induced the advancement? Maybe that might reveal more."

Jean furrowed her brows in contemplation.

"It was less of a revelation, more of an inspiration for me," Jean started. "I've read through all of my mother's journals thoroughly. I can confidently say that I know everything she has documented down to the minute details. Everything was so well researched and extensive. It covered a myriad of diseases, illnesses and traumas - it was like the pinnacle of medicine for me."

Jean's eyes sparkled brightly as she shot a firm gaze towards Al and Markus. "But then, I was shown a vision. No! I was made to embody a vision - a fully immersive experience - where I was presented with an incredible possibility. I was given a mere glimpse of the realms that medicine could achieve in the hands of mortals and non-magical humans."

"Curing diseases, treating illnesses, and assuaging traumas all without the application of mana. Can you even believe that?" Jean exclaimed.

"Ironically, it was magical," she added.

"The moment my mind assimilated this vision, I could feel the limits in my psyche disappearing," Jean revealed. "I realised that my setting my mother as my benchmark, I had put up barriers in my mind that inhibited my growth. Medicine could achieve so much more, I was just too narrow-minded and tunnel-visioned to fathom it."

"However, I still don't understand something," Jean said with a perplexed intonation. "I don't get how Teacher Larks was able to show me that vision. Everything was just so unbelieveable and foreign, I don't think it could be created through the workings of a human mind that too within such a short time frame."

Jean then proceeded to explain every detail she could recollect about the experience. She covered the foreign clothings, the compact yet highly function machines that worked through some as-of-yet unknown magic, the practiced movements and synchronised behaviours, and the systematic ambience.

"Uncle Jeeves, you've travelled far and wide. Have you ever seen anything like this?" Jean inquired.

"Not to my knowledge no," Al said while shaking his head. "But you seem to be forgetting something, Jean."

Al leaned forward and spoke with a low voice, "These visions aren't the machinations of a regular human mind, as you've said. They are the workings of a mind that has transcended humanity. You should know about Teacher Larks' inheritance."

Jean and Markus nodded hurriedly.

"These are probably excrepts from what Teacher Larks has experienced through his assimilation of the teachings in the inheritance. We cannot judge them through a common lens. There are defiintely layers of subtlety and implied meanings within that short vision you were exposed to, that you might have missed due to your limited understanding. Maybe, if you could unravel the whole truth, you might achieve an even greater breakthrough. Since it was a |Soul Imprint| the entire vision should be etched into your mind, I suggest that you revisit it frequently and decipher it to the best of your ability," Al advised.

"Teacher Jeeves is definitely correct there," Markus interjected. "The vision I was shown that allowed me to achieve perfected resonance contributed significantly in my advancement to Foundation Establishment."

"I will definitely keep that advice in mind," Jean responded. "Thank you, Teacher Jeeves and Senior Brother Reva," she bowed.

"It truly is a shame that your cultivation differs from Markus," Al said with a bitter smile. "It would have been an interesting opportunity to learn more about Markus' unique cultivation."

"Teacher Jeeves. Why don't you |Extrospect| Jean's cultivation?" Markus suggested. "Maybe a closer inspection may reveal similarities that could have been missed through a cursory glance?"

"Ha!" Al scoffed. "I'm not falling for that again."

Markus and Jean tilted their heads synchronously, displaying blatant confusion.

"*cough* I mean-" Al quickly corrected, "I don't think it's advisable with Jean."

"But Teacher Jeeves did it with me," Markus pointed out. "I'm perfectly safe."

"It's different!" Al quickly parried. "Jean is... Jean is... That's right! Jean is a girl!"

"How does that make a difference?" Markus retorted.

"Well... I have to maintain contact with Jean on her exposed stomach," Al reasoned while sweating profusely. "It's immoral!"

"It's all for science," Jean shrugged. "Besides, I treat you as family, Uncle Jeeves. It's not offensive."

Al cycled through plausible excuses in his end, but
