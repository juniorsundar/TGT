Al was pleasantly surprised by the pleasant squishiness of the red, doughnut shaped units floating through the tunnel. Through some deductive reasoning, Al had realised that he was probably inside a blood vessel, and these red objects were the blood that flowed through them. Al had observed these cells, as Guy called them, on few occasions during his past research work in medicinal alchemy. At that time, he had dismissed it as irrelevant as his work was really focussing on microbiology.

With a mischievous chuckle, Al captured another cell and held it firmly in his hands. He then concentrated mana from his body and injected into the cell. It was a pointless experiment from Al's perspective, but he was curious to know how these cells present inside Jean's cultivation would react.

As the mana entered the cell, it started to glow with a crimson hue. At one point, the mana injected reached a saturation point causing the healthy red colour to corrupt with a noxious blue tint. This was an expected reaction when foreign mana, which is attuned to another mage, is forcefully injected into a mortal non-magical's body. Unless the body is organically trained to withstand mana through cultivation or brute-force spell casting, the result is a phenomenon known as mana poisoning. Often times, mortals can get mana poisoning by simply being in an area with an unusually high mana concentration.

Just when the sickly cell disintegrated, Al's instincts blared with a vehement warning. Ever since the debacle inside Markus' core, Al had focused his cultivation towards augmenting his sense of danger. He had realised that over the years of being unopposed and hiding away behind the safety of the Academy's library had turned him rusty. Unfortunately, his preparations had become futile as before he could make a move, his exposed hand and face was attacked by a horde of blueish-white blobs that grabbed onto him tightly with their protuberances. These blobs were relentless in their assault. Al tried his hardest to pull himself out of their grasp, however they simply started to absorb him side their viscous body and pulled him further in.

Once again, Al was assaulted with a sense of powerlessness. But this time, it wasn't due to fear, rather it was because those darned blobs were subjecting him to a battery of toxins that had rendered his mana ineffective, his muscles unresponsive, and his mind sluggish. It was a frightful feeling.
