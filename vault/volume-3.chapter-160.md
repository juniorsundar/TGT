Al was pleasantly surprised by the pleasant squishiness of the red, doughnut shaped units floating through the tunnel. Through some deductive reasoning, Al had realised that he was probably inside a blood vessel, and these red objects were the blood that flowed through them. Al had observed these cells, as Guy called them, on few occasions during his past research work in medicinal alchemy. At that time, he had dismissed it as irrelevant as his work was really focussing on microbiology.

With a mischievous chuckle, Al captured another cell and held it firmly in his hands. He then concentrated mana from his body and injected into the cell. It was a pointless experiment from Al's perspective, but he was curious to know how these cells present inside Jean's cultivation would react.

As the mana entered the cell, it started to glow with a crimson hue. At one point, the mana injected reached a saturation point causing the healthy red colour to corrupt with a noxious blue tint. This was an expected reaction when foreign mana, which is attuned to another mage, is forcefully injected into a mortal non-magical's body. Unless the body is organically trained to withstand mana through cultivation or brute-force spell casting, the result is a phenomenon known as mana poisoning. Often times, mortals can get mana poisoning by simply being in an area with an unusually high mana concentration.

Just when the sickly cell disintegrated, Al's instincts blared with a vehement warning. Ever since the debacle inside Markus' core, Al had focused his cultivation towards augmenting his sense of danger. He had realised that over the years of being unopposed and hiding away behind the safety of the Academy's library had turned him rusty. Unfortunately, his preparations had become futile as before he could make a move, his exposed hand and face was attacked by a horde of blueish-white blobs that grabbed onto him tightly with their protuberances. These blobs were relentless in their assault. Al tried his hardest to pull himself out of their grasp, however they simply started to absorb him side their viscous body and pulled him further in.

Once again, Al was assaulted with a sense of powerlessness. But this time, it wasn't due to fear, rather it was because those darned blobs were subjecting him to a battery of toxins that had rendered his mana ineffective, his muscles unresponsive, and his mind sluggish. It was a frightful feeling.

"Please... not... again," Al evoked with a strained voice. He was now being forcefully sucked through the small aperture, to be absorbed completely.

Al's past mental trauma resurfaced once again with full force. Although, in reality, he wasn't as heavily suppressed as when under the influence of the black hole, he had subconsciously given up altogether.

"I guess... this is it..."

Al waited for the sweet release of death to save him from this embarrassing position. But it never came to fruition. Instead, he suddenly felt a forceful grasp and a hard yank on his bank. With an audible wooshing sound, Al was pulled out of the aperture leading into Jean's cultivation and found himself back in the impeccably bright clean-room from before.

As seconds passed, Al slowly started to regain feeling to his appendages, and found his mental capacity returning. When his senses cleared up, he realised that he was on his back, and staring right back at him was the confused face of Guy.

"I'm getting a strong sense of déjà vu," Guy chuckled.

"Don't joke!" Al snapped back. "I nearly died in there! What kind of students are you nurturing?"

Al rose unsteadily and added, "I'm leaving this place."

"Those cells that attacked you were probably the white blood cells, which are part of a human's immune system," Guy explained.

"What are they doing in there?" Al bellowed incredulously. "Why is this one's cultivation holding a space rending phenomenon that swallows you and disintegrates you, while this one's cultivation houses an unrelenting biological fiend that swallows you, pumps you up with toxic substances and then disintegrates you."

Guy smiled bitterly at Al's animated exclamation. He wasn't sure if there was even a valid response to alleviate the man's agitation.

"That's it!" Al concluded. "This is the last time I'm ever checking any of your students' cultivations. I've managed to survive for this long, and I hope to live for longer. I fear I've lost at least half a century's work of my life just through the sheer stress brought upon by your two students."

"Were you able to find anything of note, though?" Guy commented while trying to shift the conversation.

"Their cultivations are completely unrelated," Al shrugged. "I found no similarity between them. The dichotomy presented itself down to the nature of the cultivation itself."

"Markus' has to do with looking outside, into the world. While Jean's has more to do with looking inside, biologically," Al summarised. "Apart from that, I wasn't able to determine any connection to known cultivation methods. For all intents and purposes, their cultivation method is completely new and perfectly suited to them."

"That's unbelieveable!" Jean exclaimed. As an heiress to a prominent Clan, she was knowledgeable about the difficulty of the feat Al had described. According to her Uncle Jeeves, her cultivation was customised to her specifically. This meant that the method was made while centred around her
