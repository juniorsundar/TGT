"I need to hear the truth, Mast," Guy declared. After entering the RoK, he was now face to face with Mast's avatar. "The whole truth, about my death."

(What's there to learn? I've told you everything,) Mast shrugged.

"I don't believe that you have," Guy rebutted with a frown. "You have been lying to me. I want to hear the unadultered facts."

Mast tilted his head. He then waved his hand, causing a seat to materialise behind him. He lowered himself into the chair, and rested his chin on his closed fist.

(Let's say that I have been deceptive with you, what reason do I have to reveal the truth to you?) He asked, breaking the charged pause lingering in the space.

"That's understandable. After all, the way you presented things to me, I'm just a small cog in the grand scheme of things," Guy hummed while nodding. "But I do know that I am valuable to you. You have invested a lot into me, to bring me here and everything else that came along with it. This level of expenditure, and the risks assumed, implies that I have a role to play in whatever plan you've come up with. Therefore, I can say with certainty, that this small cog is what's keeping your entire mechanism from falling apart."

(You are being uncharacteristically assertive,) Mast commented with a faintly mirthful tone.

"That was my greatest flaw. I've come to realise that, albeit a bit too late," Guy muttered with a bitter smile. He then added, "I should have been more assertive in my past live."

(If you had been assertive in your past life, you wouldn't have been able to extend your charitable work to such an extent. Often times, the harder one pushes the greater opposition they face. You were given freedom to spread your work BECAUSE you were perceived as harmless in the eyes of others,) Mast responded. People in power have agendas, it is an irrefutable and immutable fact. They are willing to entertain anyone as long as it doesn't conflict

"I have come to realise that sometimes, maintaining the status quo and introducing sustainable change may not be enough."

(But it works. Given time, even the calmest of rivers can cut through mountains.)

"Stop beating around the bush and just tell me!" Guy exploded with a forceful bellow. His voice echoed within the RoK, which extended  

(You want to know whether your death was a part of my machinations?)

(It was not,) (In fact. It was not a mistake either. My world is perfect - I have made sure of it.)

"Then-"

(Your death was pure coincidence.)

"Just like everything..."

(Not exactly.)

"What?"

(Your death was coincidental, but me selecting you was not.)

"Y-You chose me on purpose? Why?"

(Like you said before. You fit perfectly into my plan.)

"Which is?"

(Irrelevant to you.)

"Stop hiding things from me, and tell me the whole damn truth!"

(I don't appreciate your tone.)

"Really? The base premise of our entire relationship was built on a lie, and you expect me to not feel infuriated?"

(The fault lies in you. You assumed our relationship was anything more than what it was.)

"Which is?"

(I believe it is pretty obvious,) (I am your benefactor.)

"Right..."

(You disagree? You should have died, but you did not,) (I gave you a second chance.)

"If that is how you view things, then take it away," "Kill me right now!"

(I cannot do that. You have not fulfilled your purpose yet?)

"And what is it? To be a toy for your amusement?"

(Your purpose is to live your life. Just like every other creature in this place of existence?)

"What do you mean?"

(I chose you specifically for a reason. And that is to continue living, exactly as you were in your past life. Achieve every unfulfilled goal and wish, resolve every regret, just be yourself,)

"I don't believe that your reasons are purely altruistic."

(You are right to think so,) (I hold no altruistic thoughts.)

"Then what is my true purpose!"

(That is not for you to know,)

"What?"

(Our conversation has gone for long enough,)

"I will end  myself if you don't tell me!"

(No you won't,) (You have too much to lose.)

"I cannot live my life the way I have till now," "I want my life to have meaning! I want to make a difference,"
