If anything, the almost-hostile-takeover Guy experienced by his more zealous counterpart was a much-needed wake-up call. For one, he realised that his previous life wasn't as impactful as he had thought it to be. Many achievements which he considered as monumental milestones appeared to have been built on a foundation of sand.

"Its seems that my accomplishments and initiatives were inconsequential in the grand scheme of things."

Secondly, he finally recognised that this world was much worse than his previous one. Even with all the unpleasantness that existed in his previous world, at least society the society there coated with a sense of peace. While most people were selfish, there was an incentive to offer aid to others. That sense of togetherness was missing in this world.

"Magic just makes things worse. Not only does it corrupt natural laws, it also corrupts the humanity in people's hearts," Guy concluded.

One couldn't predict if they would lose their life to a rogue sword or arrow, or even a virulent plague capable of devastating large swathes of territory. Poverty was rampant, widespread corruption and exploitation infested the civilisations, and the martial gap that separated the mortals from the mages had marginalised the powerless to a precarious lifestyle. To top it off, it didn't seem as though the existing authorities were willing to help improve the situation. They were satisfied with the status-quo.

"People could live such prosperous lives here. But everyone is too absorbed with accumulating power to look back and help others." This world had become rotten! The other Guy was correct in asserting that this rot had to be excised.

And the world was unforgiving to both adults and children alike. The orphans in the orphanage Guy was living in were an excellent example of this. These kids were robbed of their childhood, forced to carry the weight of the world on their backs and unable to express their true selves to the world. And who knows what horrible experiences Grace had to live through that caused her to tremble at the sight of another mage?

This was just a small sample in the large scheme of things. Guy could already fathom the lives of the other orphans around the world!

"Things probably aren't any better out there." Guy felt that it was no longer an option to sit on the sidelines and watch the world move in front of him.

Guy recognised that things needed to change. His current trajectory had to undergo a drastic shift. This change would serve dual purposes. Of course, the first was to make a meaningful contribution to the world and make a lasting difference. The second was more selfish, and it was to simply piss Mast off!

He wasn't planning to intentionally confront Mast, since that entity hadn't done anything to hurt Guy (that was he was aware of). Furthermore, Guy was also grateful for being offered a second chance even if it was conditional in some ways.

But the betrayal still hurt.

Mast must have a bottom line, but Guy hadn't infringed on it just yet. Presumably, Guy's previous trajectory wouldn't infringe on it either, otherwise, Mast would have interfered. Nonetheless, Guy was feeling confrontational. He wanted to see just how far he could push Mast's buttons, as a sign of silent protest.

"I realise that I need to make changes in the way I am handling things here," Guy muttered while scratching his chin. "The problem is that power is concentrated on the top. Just like with society in my previous life, those at the lower rungs of the ladder have a tougher time climbing up, while those already at the top can cruise through life without heavy consequences."

While in his past life, the deciding factor was wealth, the societal divisions in this world relied on magical power and cultivation.



"But where do I begin?"

Guy had a good idea of the big picture, but the intermediate steps to achieve that goal were a mystery to him. After careful thought, he figured that it would be best to inquire a more learned party, preferably one with more experience in this world. Amongst those persons that he was acquainted with that fit that bill, a single name stood out prominently.

It was the man who had helped Guy get accustomed to his life here from the beginning. With a firm and resolute expression, Guy got on his feet and trudged along to the immaculate tent set up near the orphanage, which was the temporary home of Al Jeeves.
