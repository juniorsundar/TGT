"That is quite sudden," Al commented about Guy's declaration. "And out of character. What brought about this change?"

"After a bought of rather harrowing introspection, I've come to realise a few shortcomings of mine that I feel need to be addressed immediately," Guy nodded affirmatively as he elaborated. He then proceeded to summarise his insights about himself concisely, vis-Ã -vis his aversion from conflict and extreme passivity.

"I don't see how that is a problem?" Al responded. "Your level-headedness and maturity is what makes you endearing."

For Al, being a little impulsive, forceful and aggressive was a common trait amongst mages out in the wild. This was how things worked. If one wanted to gain advantage, they had to suppress their competition through brute force. In this cesspool of muscle-headed, arrogant troglodytes, Guy was like a breath of fresh air. With his measured approach to things, and ability to take things in stride made him stand out, and it was this uniqueness that garnered Al's attention. Now, seeing as how Guy was planning to assimilate himself with the crowd, Al was a little disappointed.

"I don't intend to seek conflicts," Guy corrected. "I'm simply saying that I feel like I could do more in this world apart from holing myself away in this village."

Guy paused to formulate a proper line of reasoning and then continued. "I've taken on two students of magic- let's say two and a half including Marie, all two and a half of them have achieved perfected resonance, and one of them has even advanced into the Foundation Establishment realm."

"Master!" Markus exclaimed in surprise. "Y-You knew?"

"I assumed," Guy said with a cheeky smile. "You aren't one to give up so easily. So if you've stepped out of your seculsion, it could only mean that you've advanced successfully. Otherwise, I fear I would have had to drag you out of your room by force while you struggled at the last inch of your life after exhausting yourself completely."

Markus scratched the back of his head sheepishly.

"Of the two and a half, two did not have a cultivation method," Guy resumed. "It meant that they wouldn't be able to advance in the path of magic, yet here they are, standing at the edge of the cliff ready to leap into magehood."
