Teachers, with a capitalised 'T', have become ubiquitous with the dissemination of magic and cultivation arts. Historically, Teachers are relatively new entrants into the wild world of cultivation, breaching into prominence maybe within the last ten thousand years give or take five thousand. The standard logic for a very long time was to hoard knowledge. To grow stronger in isolation, achieve advancements in cultivation, and go against the Heavens and all that. However, one fine day, a certain mage had a bright idea. She figured, 'Why should we hoard all of this knowledge, when we could use it to help everyone?'

No one really remembers the identity of such a revolutionary thinker, because the moment she voiced her proposition out loud, she was summarily annihalated.

'Who would utter such blasphemous ideas? Does she have no common sense? *Tsk* Women... typical!' The mages of that generation disdained her at that time. Yet that pervasive idea had taken root. More and more mages, mostly those at the bottom rungs of the ladder, started to congregate and share their knowledge in hopes of growing stronger. After all, nothing brings people closer than a shared enemy. And to these unfortunate bottom feeders, the powerful Clans, Sects and Organisations were the monoliths they could never supercede.

If those monoliths had been more proactive, and less arrogant, they could have nipped this growing threat in the bud. However, their unwavering belief of superiority cost them that advantage. The appeal of being able to learn magic without having to sacrifice one's freedom was an attractive selling point. As more mages came under this unnamed co-operative's umbrella, they started to appreciate its superiority over the existing power structures.

Lombard Gronnlander was the first to achieve successive breakthroughs and breached into the Tesseract Transformation realm in record time. His success was partly due to his strong first-generation Phoenician Bloodline, and partly due to the excessive amount of resources injected into him by the co-operative. The mages recognised the urgent requirement of a spearhead and face for their cause. They alone wouldn't have been enough to stand against the existing monoliths, so they immediately unearthed Lombard given his talent for cultivation.

Lombard was made the de-factor leader of the co-operative, and went on to assert the co-operative's claim in the world of cultivation. There were many challenges and conflicts along the way, but the rag-tag groups of upstart mages held firm, and through smart and strategic maneuvering, embedded themselves deeply into the world.

Marketing played a huge part in this. The monolithic organisations had reached a point where they had become unreachable by the common classes. Entry required some connection to existing parties, or absolutely unshakeable innate advantages like physiques or bloodlines. The common class COULD enter monoliths through alternatre routes, but these were often equivalent to indentured servitude for life sometimes extending to future generations as well. The co-operative, however, did not have such restrictions. Anyone could participate as long as they could offer a manageable sum of money as fees.

The co-operative decided to branch their image favourably by calling themselves an Academy, and the instructors as Teachers with a capitalised 'T'.

"Are you a teacher?"

"No, I'm a Teacher. With a capitalised 'T'."

"Ah! I'm sorry teacher."

"Capitalise the 'T', damn it!"

"Right, right! Teacher."

"That's more like it."

Such conversations would spark within pubs, inns and restaurants.
