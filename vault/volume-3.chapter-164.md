Al was shaken by the sudden intrusion into his mind. This was partly because he could not trace back to the origin of the transmission - it was perfectly cloaked! To be able to accomplish this, the source must have strength far exceeding his own. Al wanted to revert with a question to identify this expert, however due to the lack of a "footprint" he was unable to do so.

Thus, the only thing Al could do was wait. Having lived for so long, Al was thoroughly inducted into the way of the world - the sheer brutality of it. He had learned, through bitter experience, that mages in higher realms were strange creatures that rarely operated following common logic or sense. That being said, Al himself was unaware of his own idiosyncracies that had warped his personality. Actions that one might assume to be positive through in a regular setting may end up offending peak experts - survival was akin to a perilous tightrope walk. With this in mind, Al made it a point to never, EVER, interact with anyone stronger than himself.  

Now, apparently, there was a peak expert lingering in this village - one that was in the Tesseract Transformation realm. Al held his breath and froze every single muscle in his body, and waited. He didn't want to end up offending this mysterious expert, so Al even completely retracted his mana senses. With his gaze, Al shot a warning towards Guy and his students, only to receive a blank response of nonchalance.

'Shit!' He cursed internally. 'I should have warned them immediately. They wouldn't know how to gauge the strength of this expert. They are doomed!'

Al wanted to unfreeze himself and offer some curt words of caution, but his body wouldn't respond to him. This was the result of deep-rooted fear in Al's heart. After all, he valued his own life more than anyone else's. This wasn't selfishness, it was the instinctual and raw animalistic response when facing a palpable threat.

After an excruciatingly long ten minutes, Al heard a periodic tapping noise resonating from direction of the stairs to the village. With each tap, the sound gained volume as though it were approaching them. Through hasty deduction, Al affiliated this sound to correspond to the expert. After that, every tap felt like the pounding of a hammer against his soul. The ran in syncopation with Al's own heartbeat, at least that's how he perceived them to be. It was unsettling, and claustrophobia inducing.

The taps gained clarity after an even longer five minutes. At this point, Al realised that the sound was of wood striking the ground, followed by an awkward shuffle of feet.

'A mage with a limp?' That made no sense! Becoming a mage was a surefire pathway to achieving the pinnacle of human form. Although mages had the opportunity to mould their flesh body to their liking upon achieving the Core Formation realm, he had never heard of a mage who had willingly opted for a flawed - handicapped - form. This occurence once again solidified the fact in Al's mind, that whoever the approaching expert was, had an eccentric personality. Al's soul quivered in agitation and fear upon arriving at that conclusion.

'The more eccentric and bizzare the mage's personality, the lower the chance of us exiting this interaction with our lives intact!'

Al wished nothing more than not existing in this place at this point in time.

The life-draining taps and soul-grinding shuffle came to a halt right outside Al's tent. What followed were a series of unhurried knocks, and then a calm call for permission.

"Can I come in?" The voice sounded familiar. Al had heard it before, outside the home of the pregnant woman!

"Y-Yes," Al stuttered apprehensively.
