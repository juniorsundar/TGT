"Is it right to just reveal my fate like this?" Gue questioned with a tinge of worry in his voice. "From what I've heard, there can be great consequences if you action changes the course in any way."

"Things that are supposed to happen will happen, remember?" Krish winked. "What I am about to tell you won't change anything. You won't voluntarily stop in your tracks - are you planning to not continue teaching?"

Observing Guy's lack of words, "See! Since there isn't any adverse consequence, aren't you the least bit curious to know?"

"I guess so?" Guy muttered.

"I saw a great leap," Krish started. "If the way the current world is progressing can be described in terms of architecture, it would be like a plain with a slight incline upwards. But with your intervention, a long set of stairs is introduced that leads into the sky with a steep rise and no end in sight. Now this may sound to oabstract to fathom, but that's primarily because I myself cannot put it into words."

"Can't Mage Nara use a |Soul Imprint|?" Al inquired, with the thirst of knowledge plastered blatantly accross his face.

"Not if you want both of us to die a horrible death," Krish blurted out. "Certain secrets of this world are meant to be kept as such for the safety of the masses, boy."

"Nonetheless. Returning to the architectural metaphor once again: one would assume that such an endless stair would collapse under its own weight and instability. However, this stair happened to have the strongest foundations! It was built on the fundamental truths of this world - unshakable against all adversities!"

"You've lost me there," Guy interjected while squinting his eyes. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Hmm..." Krish scratched his chin in pondrance. "You see, if I make my divination even a little more descriptive, I will be interfering with the trajectory fate has set out for you. So I need to choose my words carefully, and that is also why I try to stick close to metaphors and analogies."

"Let's put it this way then: You will leave an unimpeachable mark in this world. One that will last the test of time! The changes you will introduce will revolutionise the world from the mundane, to the complex," Krish orated slowly.

The more Krish spoke, the brighter Guy's eyes got. The elation grew to a point where even his physical body couldn't contain it, causing him to vibrate with excitement. But then, the bubbling mood was burst by Krish's next set of words.

"Sure there will be a lot of bloodshed, but in the grand scheme of things it will be all worth it."

"Bloodshed?" Guy quickly retorted. "What do you mean by that?"

"Conflicts, deaths," Krish listed. "Genocide. Maybe a cultural purge. You know? The usual occurences during any war of conquest."

Guy's back was immediately drenched in sweat - an involuntary action that even his superior physique couldn't prevent. It was the outcome of a fear that had been plaguing his mind. After the almost-hostile-takeover of his body by the parasitic entity embodying his split soul - the other Guy with a capitalised 'G' given that he was no longer a mindless being - Guy was constantly disturbed by a singular question.

'What if the other Guy took over completely?'

Would it have been a better outcome? Guy recognised that he could not achieve anything with his usual passivity - an active hand was pertinent. Changing his personality would be difficult. Guy realised recently that
