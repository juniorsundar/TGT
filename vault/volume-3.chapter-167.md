Krish hummed contemplatively while staring at the two kids animatedly denying his divination. This wasn't the first time someone denied his prophecies so vehemently right to his face. Over the years, Krish had come to realise the juxtaposition of the human mentality. Whenever Krish's divination reveal beneficial truths or facts, the recipients are quick to accept it - overjoyed even. However, the moment the divinations reveal proclamations that run contrary to the recipient's expectations, they immediately reject it.

After a short pause that seemed to extend for a much longer time frame given the charged atmosphere that reigned in the room, Krish sighed audibly. Al took that as a sign of exasperation and immediately nudged Jean from the back, adding on a few expressive signals using his eyes and face to urge her to apologise immediately. For better of worse, Jean was unable to decipher those signals, and even if she could comprehend she wouldn't act on it since her Senior Brother was holding his ground unfalteringly.

"Do you think it could be an anomaly?" Guy spoke up. "I mean, you couldn't see my future until that short blip. You can't see that same future in the fates of my Disciple, students and others around me. It is only a singular and, as far as we know, isolated incident. Right?"

"Maybe you are right," Krish conceded. "Maybe you aren't. If I am being honest it is the first time for me as well, to experience something like this. But I can tell you for certain that whatever the Heavenly Eye sees is absolute. Make out of it what you will."

Guy bit his lips in distress while repeatedly chanting, 'That's not going to happen,' internally. 'That cannot happen!'

"Let's put that aside for the time being!" Krish followed up to redirect the conversation. He knew that nothing good could come from preoccupying oneself over a future so distant. Having lived with such a power for such a long time, Krish could ascertain that what some considered a blessing was oftentimes a curse. Like how a thief must constantly look over their shoulders for signs of pursuers, a person informed of their future must constantly doublethink their next step in fear of their dread coming to fruition. Little do they know that their hesitation and overthought can accelerate things further.

"Since you path is now free of obstacles, what are you going to do next?" Krish asked Guy.

"Next?" Guy faltered. "I don't know..."

"That's understandable. The decision was only finalised now. Logistics and action plans take time and thorough analysis to take form," Al empathised. "But I must warn you to not it lightly. Creating a sect may be easy, but maintaining it is where the real challenge lies."

"I had a similar conclusion," Guy affirmed. "It's not something I have done before, after all. I would love to learn more about it, though."

"There aren't books on sect management, I am afraid," Krish shrugged.

"What about observation?" Guy blurted out. "Do you guys think it might be possible to observe a functioning sect?"

"That's a risky option," Krish cautioned. "Sects aren't like Academies, in that secrecy and sovereignty are of utmost importance. You can't just waltz in, especially with such a flimsy reason."
