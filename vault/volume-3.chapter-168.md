The Griffin named Garrud was Al's familiar. A familiar is a being of another species tied in a pseudo-master-slave relationship with a mage. The bond is at the soul level, and is hence an irreversible process, and is generally a mutually beneficial relationship. As the mage progresses in their cultivation, the familiar receives positive feedback in theirs which helps them advance, and vice-versa. However, due to the ingrained nature of this bond, should either party face a catastrophe of fatal proportions, the other will face an equal retribution through their soul connection.

The art of forming this robust soul bond was introduced to mankind by the elves of the Fae Realm. The sentient elven race were unique in that they were born with very low mana capacity and weaker physiques. Compared to a human at the same cultivation realm, an elf might have less than half their mana capacity and somewhere between two-thirds to three-quarters of their strength. Although, compared to an average human, an average elf had far superior aesthetics and charms.

Yet, how could such a weak race, on paper, survive in such a perilous environment of the Fae Realm and become the dominant species to walk those lands?

This was because the strength of the Fae lied not in their raw martial prowess, but in their superior spiritual capacities. While humans could guage their mana capacities quantitatively, the same could not be said for their spiritual strengths. Till date, the spiritual aspect of cultivation, more specifically the soul, remains an elusive topic for most sentient races. That is, apart from the elves. The strength of a newborn elves' soul far exceeds that of a mortal human at the prime of their life.

Though many have tried to research this peculiarity, none have managed to derive a robust conclusion. Some believe that the elves' naturally long life expectancy, which is two and a half times that of a human, may have something to do with their high spiritual capacity. This, and the fact that it takes them double the time to mature biologically compared to humans. Others believe that inheritance and assimilation during fetal stages may have something to do with it. Elves have a very sparse birth and proliferation rate within their kind, which is further hampered by the fact that an elf mother gestates for nearly two years. Childbirth is elves is also much more perilous than in humans.

Nonetheless, the elves' large spiritual capacity enables them to form symbiotic relationship with beasts of other species through familiar bonds, and this is where their true strength lies. There have been records of an entire country being ravaged by a single elf in the Core Condensation realm and his horde of familiars - fighting elves is seldom a one-versus-one confrontation.

Ultimately, a rudimentary technique to form familiar bonds was shared with the humans years before the Age of Isolation, which has survived the test of time by being held firmly within the grasps of the Beast Taming Guild. The technique hasn't changed for millenium, not for the lack of trying. The field of soul strength and spirituality is just too complex for human beings and other sentient races to comprehend, thus rather than tampering with the existing method that works just fine, mages choose to stick to the status quo.

In the current age, if anyone wanted to take in a familiar, they had to do it through the Beast Taming Guild AFTER achieving a minimum of 2-stars. Another opportunity is presented to take one a new familiar with each successive star achieved. It was needless to say that very few people held more than four stars, since each new familiar basically segmented the mage's soul proportionally to the beast's soul power.

Take Garrud for instance. A griffin is born with pseudo-sentience. Within months of hatching from its egg, the griffin's cultivation accelerates through the Mana Condensation realm to the Foundation Realm, at which point they reach adolescence. A griffin's DNA is encoded with a rudimentary cultivation method that elevates them to the Core Formation realm where they solidify full sentience.

As expected, the griffin's soul power expands exponentially once they enter Core Formation, at which point forming a familiar bond becomes extremely difficult unless the griffin acquiesces to it voluntarily; a mature griffin's soul power can rival that of a mage in the same cultivation realm. If there isn't a consensus from the familiar, a severe backlash can be incurred which will end up crippling the mage entirely.

"I found Garrud as an egg," Al explained to Guy and Markus who were clutching onto the jerking body of the feathered and furred beast as it skimmed across the skies. "I formed a familiar bond with it the moment it hatched, otherwise it would have been impossible! Griffins are notoriously proud and highly territorial."

"H-How did you find the egg?" Guy inquired while trying to control his chattering teeth. The sheer distance between their current altitude and the ground was agitating his acrophobia. Even his Disciple had increased the force with which he grabbed Guy's waist.

"Total coincidence! You wouldn't even believe it," Al exhorted. "There was a contract posted for exterminating a pair of griffins up at Gold-Plated Hills quite a ways West from Twilight Village. Many heads congregated there to undertake this venture, the beat couple WERE in the Core Condensation Realm after all. On a side note, beasts at a cultivation realm are generally stronger than human mages at the same realm. It has to do with their superior physiques, bloodlines and one-track-minded cultivation methods. None of those distractions that humans suffer from, holding their cultivations back."

"So anyways, I wanted to try my luck out. I hadn't confronted griffins before"
