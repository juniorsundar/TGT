A man massaged his silver beard while gazing into the horizon with a vigourous sheen in his eyes. His lips parted into a devious smile as his senses locked onto the approaching figure of another man, followed by a still adolescent griffin carrying two individuals. His attention quickly diverted from the critters incapable of flight and the beast and doubled down on the other man.

"I knew he'd cash it in one day," the man said audibly with a reverberating chuckle. He gazed down on his clothes once again, a redundant action since he could easily observe it through his mana senses, and fixed his black overcoat. He then dusted his black skin-tight shirt - another redundant action since he could easily dispel all blemishes with his magic - and casually inserted his hands into his black trouser pockets.

After his final checks, he reverted his attention to the flying figure once again. As he did so, the man could feel his heartbeat hastening, he was getting agitated.

"This feeling," the man said with a near ecstatic expression. "This excitement! How many years has it been since I felt this?"

The man's impeccable memories didn't fail him. The last time he felt this way was when he fought against Al Jeeves. It was a feeling of intoxication. His every fibre of being was pulsing at a feverish pace as all of his latent battle instincts were called into action. It was the kind of battle the man yearned for.

A mage experiences three kinds of life-or-death battles in their lifetime. One when facing someone weaker, one when facing someone much stronger, and one when facing someone of equal or equivalent strength. The first kind is no fun, the victory is often known before the die is cast. The same sentiment is true for the second kind, since the only outcome in those confrontations is death. The third kind is where all the juice lied.

When fighting toe to toe with an opponent, one gets the opportunity to flex every single technique held in their arsenal. Because in those kinds of fights, the victory is always awarded to the mage with the superior skill, even if it is greater by a fingernail's margin. This was the kind of fight the man sought out so fervently. And this was the fight he got when facing Al Jeeves.

The man inhaled while positively shaking with exuberance, and honed all of his senses on the singular entity: Al Jeeves.

Al clicked his tongue in annoyance as a familiar probe washed over him. A mage's mana sense exists within the limit of their mana domain. Within said domain, everything is in control of the mage as long as they have the knowledge to manipulate the mana to their liking. However, when two mages confront each other, a peculiar interaction takes place when their mana domains overlap.

In most cases, the mage with the higher cultivation realm wins. To elaborate, the weaker mage will find it increasingly difficult to cast spells and manipulate the mana around them as the stronger mage fully collapses their wider mana domain into the weaker mage. The victory isn't always absolute since minor maneuvering and subterfuge can shift the balance ever so sligthly. However, when the realms of the mages are close in cultivation realms, the conflict within the overlapping domain turns into a heated dance with each side vying for the faintest opportunity to cut through the other's barriers.

Al immediately slowed his flight and activated a few spells inaudibly, essentially blocking the probe directed towards him. The victory in this confrontation was conceded to him, once again. This reignited the irksome feeling Al felt towards the man standing in the distance.

"We are approaching the destination," Al informed Guy and Markus. "Remember everything I've told you."

The duo nodded affirmatively and looked forward, past the light mist which prevailed before them. Unlike Al, Guy and his Disciple's vision and mana sense were much more gimped in terms of range. They could only see a tad farther than a regular human, so all their eyes could capture was a faint silhouette of what could only be described as an upside-down mountain beyond a thin cloudy veil. Guy squinted while trying to gain a clearer visual, and within a quick half-minute, he was able to see their destination in its full majesty.

What looked like an upside-down mountain was actually a massive rock hovering precariously off the ground. Along the sides of this hovering mountain were various buildings, walkways and structures that were bustling with activity. These walkways and structures snaked in and out of the mountain, like an elegant worm eating into a fruit.

"How is this even possible?" Guy exclaimed.

"This region is naturally dense in mana," Al explained, "When there is excess mana in a location, one can expect anomalous phenomenon. Most large sects can be found in such mana rich locations."

"It goes against all laws of physics," Markus muttered.

"Mana truly is a mystery," Guy affirmed with an impressed tone.

The trio ascended as they approached the mountain, aiming for a flat landing space near the peak. As they rose, Guy observed the architecture further. The style closely matched the Mediterranean design motifs he'd seen back at Radiant City. Pillars and arches were in excess, with intricate sculptures and carvings peppered in various locations. The colour pallete was fairly warm with a preference towards natural brown and creamy shades. The paths had a cobblestone look in the public spaces, while near and inside buildings he could observe marble. There was also a heavy preference for open air design, which felt weird given the cold atmosphere at the higher altitude. But things became clear when they reached a few kilometres away from the mountain. As though a huge space heater had been activated, the previously chilly area around them turned slightly humid and warm.

Al observed the change in Guy's expression and said, "There are multiple formations protecting the mountain. We wouldn't be able to enter the vicinity of this mountain unscathed if not for this entry token."

Al fished out an embellished marble token the size of his palm which had beautiful cloud pattern on it.

"Amongst the many formations, one that controls the weather moderates the atmosphere. There are also formations that moderate the mana concentration in and around the mountain to avoid causing mana poisoning to new iniates to the sect, or visitors."

"That's extremely convenient," Guy commented. "And expensive," he added as he recollected the mana crystal expenditure required to maintain the formation.

"Thanks to the mana concentration in the area, most of these formations can be sustained without mana crystals. Some of the more active defense formations do require additional mana, but those are only activated during dire scenarios," Al responded.
