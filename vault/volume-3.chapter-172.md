As Guy added more and more books into the RoK, he entered a fugue state of semi-consciousness. This was a first for him, a usual speed-reading session never took him to such a level of immersion. What he was experiencing at the moment was magical through and through.

Imagine completing a book and moving on to the next one. At that point, you would expect to have repressed the information accumulated from the first book to the back of your conscious mind as you focused on the current one. However, for Guy, it was as if everything he read before was overlapping with what he was reading at the moment. The effect kept getting stacked as he moved from one book to another. It could be likened to holding down on the sustain pedal while playing the piano. Guy wasn't sure why or how this was possible, but he could confirm that it wasn't a benefit gained from the RoK or the Church.

Thanks to his current state, he could easily stitch together an intricate story as more content was being added into his repository. It was as though each book in the Archive held a puzzle piece that could only be extracted by reading it to its entirety. With each piece obtained, a flourishing tapestry came into view.

'So sects are a relatively new concept?' Guy exclaimed. 'Wait... 23000 years? That's not new at all!'

Before sects came into the picture, hierarchical congregations of unaffiliated warriors, mages, mercenaries and their ilk were called Adventurers' Guild. According to a historical text, if it could be called that given the rampant use of speculative and exagerrated language, during the times of yore when the concepts of magic were still mystical and uncategorised those beings with the gift of magic often joined a union of some kind known as an Adventurers' Guild where they work by practicing their magical trade in the form of quests. Each Adventurers' Guild had a Guild Master who was often elected by members of the guild. They could be elected through a contest of strength or other talents such as management, connections or wealth. An Adventurers' Guild operated within a particular region, which was their de facto region of influence. New guilds could be formed under the umbrella of an existing guild or they could sprout off on their own. However, encroaching into the territories of other guilds generally ended in a conflict called a Guild War, and the culmination of which either the losing guild ceased to exist through total annihalation or assimilation into the winner.

Guy found that these Adventurers' Guilds shared a lot of similarities with the one's he'd read of in a lot of fantasy novels in his past life. Their function and mode of operation was extremely similar. However, Guy also found that there was very little similarity between an Adventurers' Guild and a Sect apart from the fact that they were by definition, a congregation of mages. An Adventurers' Guild had a generally flat hierarchical structure. There was the Guild Master followed by a Vice-Guild Master or an Administrator, and then there were the rest of the members. The hierarchy amongst members was fluid and decided based on strength and fame. In a Sect, there were multiple layers of hierarchy, often times to an exhausting degree. A Guild was not a place for disseminating and teaching magic to others. This was usually performed through Master-Disciple dynamics. However, a Sect was also an institute for learning that cultivated new members. There were many such dissimilarities that separated the Guilds of yore from the Sects of... yore. So that begged the question, how did these Adventurers' Guilds transform to become Sects?

The test went further to paint a picture of how the guilds evolved to become sects, which was quite an interesting read. Because of the arcane nature of magic, only those with talent, bloodline, physique, or the ability to view the world with a skewed point of view could manifest powers. Those that couldn't manifest magic naturally could also learn it through a Master-Disiple relationship. The issue, though, was that a Master that learned magic through intuition would find it difficult to explain it to a Disciple. Only those disciples with the intelligence to interpret their "genuis" Master's nonsense could succeed in this case. Over time, as the disciples became masters and cultivated disciples of their own, their structured method of magic became more and more refined, reaching a point where a large group of individuals all shared the same form of magic. In this case, it was illogical for this group to affiliate themselves with a loosely structured guild with a hodge-podge of other characters. They found it prudent to create a "guild" of their own that could act as a vehicle to train more mages like themselves.

In some instances, other groups of similarly trained mages decided to form alliances amongst themselves to form a multi-faceted "guild". Once these new "guilds" entered the scene, they quickly took the old guild's by storm. For one, the appeal of being able to learn and improve WHILE earning swayed people towards these new "guild" who turned to calling themselves sects as it was a more fitting name for their collective. During this transformation, a lot of other changes happened alongside. For example, the dichotomy between mages who applied magic externally, and warriors who worked their magics internally was erased altogether. Ultimately, magic was magic no matter how mana was being used.

'It's not a wholly unbiased recounting, but it is sufficient. Besides, knowing the history of sects in general does little to aid my cause.' Guy concluded. 'But everything else here is so... boring and bland.'

The fact was that the Cloudstrider Sect, probably like every other sect in this world, had a monotonous operation style. The sect itself started some 5000 years ago - after the Age of Isolation - making it one of the older sects in the scene, however not much had changed in the way things worked.
