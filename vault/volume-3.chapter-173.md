"You're short! There are only three phials here, our agreement was for ten," a teenage boy dressed in a white robe with indigo and gold clouds emroidered on it chided with a disdainful frown on his face.

"I'm sorry Senior. The collection has become much harder given the increase in the... demand. I believe three more members from the Outer division reporting to Senior," another teenager responded with a painfully deep bow. He was garbed in a black robe with similar embroidery minus the gold inlays. The condition of the fabric was also miles behind that of the other boy's, with frequent scuff marks and hastily patched up tears peppered around them.

"Are you saying it's my fault?" the white-robed boy shot back aggressively?

"N-No-"

Before he could respond, the black-robed boy was grabbed by his hair and slammed into the ground. The white-robed boy looked around hastily before dragging the boy by his hair into an occluded of alley.

"I believe I made myself pretty clear the last time," the sentenced was paused as an audible punch landed on the black-robed boy, in a region below his ribs. "You donate Body Tempering Potions to me, and I don't hurt you."

Another punch landed in the same location, eliciting a pained groan from the black-robed teen.

"I wouldn't need to recruit more members from the Outer division if you had done better. Are you satisfied with doing the bare minimum?" The question was followed by a kick towards the black-robed teen, who was in the fetal position. "If you want to attract the attention of your superiors, you need to go above and beyond. What I gave you was a test."

"Fucking Outer trash! Get this through your head. This is how cultivation works. It's all about gaining benefits when possible," the white-robed teen bellowed maniacally. "If you want to get ahead, you need to step over a few heads in the process. Do you think every piece of shit entering the Outer division gets to enter the Inner division?"

"Do you think this is unfair?" The boy asked sarcastically.

"N..." a low mumble was heard. The attacker lowered himself into a squat and raised the beaten boy by his hair once again.

"That's right! You should be grateful! This Senior is simply teaching a lucky Junior such as yourself. So learn diligently, okay?" the white-robed exhorted with a snicker oozing with morbid enjoyment. "This is motivation. Do better!"

Markus walked past the alley with his attention consciously averted from the one-sided beatdown occuring within. The white-robed teen continued to pummel down on the nearly unconscious boy in the ground, making sure to avoid the most visible locations. Markus could only shake his head in disappointment at the outcome of a series of events. He was disappointed at the fact that life in a Sect was no different that back in the Academy. In many ways it was worse here because there was a clear differentiation in hierachy between those less capable and those more capable in cultivation.

What the black-robed boy was going through, Markus had suffered worse. He had been hurt for the pettiest of reasons, sometimes simply existing and breathing was enough to warrant an assault. One day, Markus simply looked at a girl in his cohort for a second longer than the norm. That also ended up with him getting shoved into the garbage collector. Not because the girl demanded it, but rather a few groups of teens his age, who had failed to attract the attention of the girl, took it upon themselves to punish anyone with "untoward" thoughts. No one came to save him that day. Passers-by simply lowered their heads and moved on, just like he was doing now.

Sure Markus sympathised with the black-robed boy's plight. But he wasn't in any position to interfere. For one, Markus was pretty sure that the way the black-robed boy collected those three phials of potions was by meting out the same level of hurt to those around him. Secondly, Markus was in no position here to interfere. He could stand up and condemn the assaulter, and then what? Markus was sure he was stronger than the assaulter - he could beat him. But the victory would be overshadowed with a gauntlet of confrontations with a Senior above his conquest, then another, then another, until finally an Elder would descend on him with the fury of a thousand suns for a simple "sleight" that had grown out of proportions.

An intervention was necessary, but not one that started from the trenches like this. If a change had to be made, it needed to come from the top. And in a world that listened only to the strongest, Markus' voice would barely register as a whisper.

"It's all a learning experience," Markus repeated to himself. After all, he was here only to observe, not interfere. His purpose here was to gather information for his Master's sect - as a Disciple, he wasn't here to make things harder for his Master. Everything good should be assimilated, everything undesirable should be recorded and avoided.

Therefore, Markus decided to put the uncomfortably rampant bullying within sect premises at the top of the 'Everything Undesirable' list in his head. Speaking of discomfort, there appeared to be another kind of bullying he hadn't yet experienced in his lifetime... bullying of the sexual kind. Not just men acting... ungentlemanly with women, but also women pushing themselves aggressively against other men all to gain benefits for themselves. Of course, the horned up male teens were unaware of the blatant harrassment they were facing, but Markus, as a third-party, was extremely disgusted.

"To use their bodies in such a way..."

After an exeedingly mountainous amount of effort, Markus finally tuned out all the bullying and decided to focus on other things. Unfortunately, he was disappointed to find that there really was nothing else of notice within the Sect.

His first stop was at a rather prominent building at the centre of the Sect which was labeled as the Mission Centre. He could only enter and peruse the
