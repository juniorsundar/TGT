Most of the "public" sections of the Sect were constructed outside the mountain, unlike the Archives. Thanks to that, Markus was able to enjoy the mangificent architecture in its entirety. It was the only thing he could do to distract himself from all the unpleasantness around him.

Although he had tuned out the bullying and corrupt practices proliferating around him, he just couldn't get himself to immerse into the Sect's culture and ambience. For some reason, he kept feeling a sense of rejection pulsing inside him, urging him to leave immediately. 

Maybe it was the claustrophobic environment contrary to the widely open nature of the Sect's design. The precarious location and general unreachability evoked a sense of imprisonment - a feeling of being trapped. Markus had learned through strategic inquiries that Outer division members weren't allowed to leave Sect premises unless it was for a mission. The Inner and Core division members had more leniency, however they were also tethered to a large degree. Markus could guess that all those people would start feeling like animals trapped inside an isolated cage.

Markus had once heard of an experiment from his Master. It was about an isolated room, filled with rats who would have every physiological need of theirs catered to. Food, water, a place to sleep, the rats would have everything they could ever want. However, they were never allowed to leave the room. No rat could leave, and no other rat could enter. The experiment persisted for a very long time, over the course of which, the investigators tracked the changes in social dynamics occuring within the cage.

In the early stages, the rats were content - they flourished. But as time progressed, their indulgence started to falter, as a growing sense of depression started to prevail amongst the populace. A few rats secluded themselves in their personal spaces, avoiding interactions with others. Other rats devolved into their most base and violent instincts. The derangement ramped up very quickly after that point, when rats started to attack and kill each other at the lightest provocations. The experiment ended in a bloodbath with only a few rats, who had lost their sanity, left alive.

What Markus could feel permeating within the ironically pleasant Sect air, was this foreboding sense of violence and depravity.

"This isn't a place to learn!" It wasn't conducive at all!

The only places where teaching of some kind took place were at this large congregational buildings known as pavilions. These buildings were multifunctional, in their they operated as both repositories and storage rooms, as well as lecture and practice halls. For example, the Ritual Formation Pavilion was one of the larger buildings in the Sect. It was only a short distance away from the Mission Centre as you descended mountain.

The Ritual Formation Pavilion had two architectural forms mated into one seamless structure. There was a towering section which also acted as the entrance and hall, as well as a flat and wide section which acted as the practice area. After a long stretch of disappointment, Markus was finally excited to explore an actual house of learning.

However, after truly understanding the way the pavilion functioned, Markus was once again served a second scoop of disappointment.

The pavilion operated by a pay-to-access principle; not everyone could enter and benefit from its many features. If one wanted to access the repositories, storage rooms, or practice halls, they had to submit a certain amount of internal currency known as 'Sect Merits'. The lecture halls were free to access as long as a lecture took place there, which was apparently very infrequent. For reference, the last lecture held there was six years ago. Entry to lecture halls was first-come-first-serve, which was a fancy way of saying those with most influence and strength would get the seats closest to the front.

Returning to the concept of Sect Merits, the only way to earn these merits was by performing assigned tasks or missions. That's right, although the missions offered a specific payout, the reward was fully appropriated by the Sect and the participants were awarded Sect Merits in return. These merits could then be turned in for certain benefits like accessing these restricted sections in the many Pavilions in the Sect, accessing the Sect's main weapon cache, personal tutoring time with Elders, and so on.

At cursory glance, the Merits system may seem like an exercise to encourage participation and sense of belonging, however, Markus could see past the flimsy facade and understood the grim undertones of this system.
