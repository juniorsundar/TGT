"Is that the best you've got?!"

"Not by a long shot! Try defending this!"

Markus observed the fight on stage with an unwavering gaze. The two combatants collided once again, one sword against another, causing a small shockwave to spread out. Both of them appeared to be on the verge of collapse, one with a fractured arm and another with multiple shattered ribs, both of which could easily be fixed with a small sip of a regenerative potion.

In his time as a mage, Markus had only ever participated in a handful of combat scenarios. Of those cases, only one truly pushed him to apply his strengths to their fullest and that was against Gaige. So, it wasn't a stretch to admit that Markus was inexperienced in combat, and this conclusion did not sit well with him. Even though his Master emphasised the art of dialogue in resolving conflicts, but what of Markus' goal in walking the mage's path? What guarantee was there that every conflict could be solved by a civilised discussion? At the end of the day, when spells start flying and weapons start swinging, even the most well-crafted of words cannot stop heads from rolling. 

'I don't think martial arts are the way to go, though,' Markus wondered. Although back in the Academy, he was put through a basic course of martial-arts, it wasn't anything special that resonated with him. It was a generic set of combat arts, which wasn't even thoroughly explained. His cohort were provided an instruction manual, and were assigned a set time-period during each day to practice the sequences defined in the manual. There would be an instructor only in name, as they never intervened in any way. One must know that the starting cohort in most Academies, like in sects, was sizeable and there were a lot of heads to go around. The expectation during these early stages was to filter out the weaker "investments". During the martial training sessions, peers would compete against each other through spars, some in good faith and others with malicious intentions. Markus was unfortunately subjected to the latter, since his proficiency wasn't in combat and was thus generally slower in grasping the movements.

Gaige had his own unique martial-art that meshed with his cultivation. Markus wasn't disappointed or envious of that because his path did not require him to hold a cold weapon, or propel his arms and legs against his opponents. His weapon was the humble forearm-length piece of wood that his Master had crafted for him, and his mind.

His Master would often jokingly say that "a mage must always be prepared."

No matter the situation, a mage MUST have a solution handy. An unprepared mage is a dead mage. It was due to this mantra that Markus perpetually carried a handsfree belt-satchel, and the Grimoire crafted by Teacher Jeeves on his person. In the satchel, he would store phials and containers of useful resources that could aid him during spellcasting or allow him to escape. The Grimoire contained all the information he would ever need.

With this said, why was Markus so engrossed in the fight? Markus' primary goal here wasn't to learn to fight from the combatants, but to formulate possible countermeasures should he have to confront the two in the future. Markus' mind constantly ran simulations that pitted himself against the opponents and recreated every move, spell and attack. If he couldn't determine a countermeasure within the time the attack took to hit him, he would note it down mentally so that he could address it at a later time.

The combatant with the fractured hand leapt back to separate himself and immediately spun around while slashing his sword. As he did so, the metal started to glow a dangerous turqouoise shade and a wave of wind swept forward. The other combatant wasn't prepared for that, he expected his opponent to continue an exchange of sword attacks in close range. The separation agitated his rib injury causing a momentary lapse in concentration. The gush of sharp air hit him on his shattered ribs, tearing his already tattered clothes and shoving him backwards forcefully. With a pain-filled scream, the teen rolled off the stage and collapsed unconscious.

While a few attendants immediately rushed towards the injured combatants and administered first-aid, Markus pondered over the last attack. It may look simple on surface, but he could see that the wind blade that was projected forward was a highly complex spell when observed at a closer level. The complexity came from the fact that there were multiple minor wind blades formed by small eddies within the projected gust which added an additional shredding action to the attack WITHOUT breaking up the gust as a whole.

The question was, could he have defended against that attack? The answer was yes, he could have defended that attack because it originated from a mage in Mana Condensation realm. The amount of mana behind the attack was low, and the mage's mana domain was abysmal. Markus could easily overpower that gust before it even left the sword. However, Markus took the inquiry to the next level by amplifying the attack to match that of a Foundation Establishment realm mage. Could he have defended against one like that?

When it comes to defending, the answer can fall somewhere between two ends of a spectrum. You can have a sweeping defense that covers all bases, or you can have a specialised defence that is perfect for the attack you intend to block. The easiest way to define the two is by using a swordfight as a basis of comparison. Two warriors with a sword and shield each enter combat. The first warrior swings their sword with a sidewards slash. The attack is telegraphed and the defended is faced with two options, they could either raise their shield to block the attack, or they could use their own sword to parry the attack and follow it up with a shield bash and gain the advantage.

Immediately, the difference is evident. The shield block is a sweeping defense. Although it is effective, it is wasteful. The blocker has to take the shock from the attack, and they do not gain any advantage from the defensive maneuvre as the initiative is still in the attacker's hands. However, there is a high guarantee of success. On the other hand, a parry is more efficient, but sacrifices the guarantee and is also heavily reliant on the blocker's skill. However, upon a successful parry, the initiative is turned over to the defender.

A mage has a blocking spell in their arsenal known as |Ward|. There are variations of the spell such as |Lesser Ward|, |Greater Ward|, |Ward Wall|, and so on that build upon the spell. Essentially, the mage puts up a multi-layered mana shield to physically block the attacks. The greater the proficiency with the spell, the greater the number of layers and the stronger the defense. It was simple and fit the purpose. However, the downside here was that a |Ward| spell consumed mana when active, and consumed mana proportional to the damage it sustained.
