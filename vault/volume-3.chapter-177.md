"It's Cleo Loras!"

"That's her? She's so beautiful!"

The men whooped in a low tone and slobbered at the appearance of the beauty, while the women revealed a false smile to hide their quivering sneers.

'I have to leave. NOW!'

"And with that, the Outer Division Ranking Tournament comes to a close," the girl spoke with a pleasant, sing-song voice. The crowd around Markus turned silent and everyone assumed their seats.

'Shit! I can't leave now or else I will stand out.' Markus too sat down in his spot. His instincts were telling him to brace for the worst.

"The results will be deliberated by the panel of judges and the rankings will be posted soon. Before we end today's event, I would like to offer an opportunity to those present here today. I am opening the floor up to a challenge, anyone here can challenge me to a duel right-now. If you are at a lower cultivation realm, I will suppress myself to match you. As an ante, I will put up this-"

The girl waved her hand and a few attendants brought in a mound of ore.

"- Red Moloch ore. For those that do not know of it, Red Moloch is a highly malleable and silky metal often used for protective apparel worn by spellcasters. It is highly resilient to extreme temperatures, and is capable of dissipating most physical attacks."

The crowd started to murmur and commented on the rarity of the ore. Based on the conversation, it appeared to be an extremely scarce mana metal, found only within the volcanic abode of an ancient Phoenix that resided on an isolated island in the Toroid Ocean to the East.

"How generous," Markus muttered involuntarily.

"Indeed! Miss Loras is the kindest person in the Sect," a slobbering teen affirmed.

'Too generous,' Markus repeated. This was a disconcerting sign. When things appeared to be too convenient, coincidental, or generous, there was always something morbid brewing behind the scenes. Someone was up to something. Markus did not believe the praises showered by the surrounding men one bit. 'The girl has an agenda, and I don't want to get involved in it!'

"The duel will follow standard rules of engagement," the girl continued. "So, who's interested."

As expected, no one
