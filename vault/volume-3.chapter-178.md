Cleo was caught mid sentence, as a |Fireball| collided against her. It was thanks to the warding enchantments on her attire that most of the damage was mitigated.

"Thi-"

BOOM!

Cleo's eyes widened in shock. Just as the smoke from the previous attack cleared before her, she saw three spell circles, covering upon one larger circle, spinning rythmically around Markus' wand-bearing hand. The one at the centre produced another |Fireball| of identical size and propelled it without pause. This time, Cleo was prepared. She immediately activated a |Lesser Ward| and blocked the incoming attack.

Right as the |Fireball| dissipated over the ward, another one rushed towards here. Cleo was dumbfounded. 'Is he trying to end it quickly by overpowering me with spells?'

She gritted her teeth and blocked the attack once again, only to field another one, then another one, and another one. The barrage of |Fireball| spells were unending and relentless. No matter how she dodged the spell, he path would be intercepted by a |Fireball|.

'I can outlast him, as long as I keep my pressure up within the overlapping domain, he should be expending more mana to propel the |Fireball| spells,' Cleo concluded. Although the attacks hadn't physically hit, it was an exhausting endeavour to dodge, weave and block. What she thought would be a trivial victory had turned into an arduous labour.

However, her plans wouldn't come to pass. 'His tempo hasn't changed. He isn't exhausted. And I can't feel his influence in my mana domain at all! Why isn't the Fire Mana being agitated with all these |Fireball| spells flying around?'

If the other Guy were here, he would preach that Markus' spells communicate directly with the Truth of the World. Without the need for elaborate lies, the world does half the work for you. To top it off, Markus was barely tapping into his mana pool to case these |Fireballs|. By offsetting the cost of combustion with a more efficient fuel called Nitor, he could go on for days. 

Over the past year, Markus had updated the resources stored in his hands-free belt satchel, in large part thanks to his Junior Sister's assistance and recommendations. Nitor, for instance, is an alchemical intermediate ingredient created by concentrating the "burning" nature of coals. In other words, its a type of alkane with an extremely high carbon constituence. Naturally, such a hydrocarbon is unstable, however thanks to a few trivial steps, it is possible to create it in large quantities. In comparison, a small pinch of Nitor powder is equivalent to two hand-sized chunks of coal.

'I can't keep this up, I'm just exhausting myself,' Cleo concluded. 'I need to cover the distance.'

Cleo centred herself and allowed a few |Fireball| spells to collide against her enchanted gear. Then, by lowering her frame, she weaved through the successive onslaught and managed to reduce the distance between herself and Markus. Since the start, she had barely managed to move from her initial position. Even if she moved sideways, forwards or backwards, Markus would reposition himself to maintain the separation while pushing her back to the starting point. However, through expert maneuvring she was now midway.

With another leap, she was a blade's length away from Markus. He could no longer cast |Fireball| lest he hurt himself. Cleo could taste the blood at this point, but then it happened again. She miscalculated her push through an overestimation. She pushed too hard, and instead of landing within her blade's engagement distance, she was an arm's length away. At this position, she could not follow through with her sideward's slash which she had prepared. She would have to either strafe backwards or switch to a body attack to push Markus into her engagement distance.

These calculations occured within her head within split-seconds. However, she knew she had lost her advantage. And Markus took advantage of this. The spell circls on his hand dispersed and new ones took their place. The change was near instantaneous, well beyond the level of most mages in this cultivationr ealm. Furthermore, although she was at this close distance, she could still not make heads or tails of the simple yet intricate designs within. Markus pushed his empty hand against Cleo's left chest and jabbed the wand under her chin. From the hand that contacted her chest, bloomed another spell circle.

Then, all of Markus' hair rose towards the sky, and sparks started to burst from them. Within Cleo's mana domain, she percieved a change. It was rapid and pervasive. In an instant, a sharp smell assaulted her senses, which was immediately followed by a rush of lightning flowing through her. It was an intense shock that undulated within her, spasming her muscles and organs. She lost control of her body in intermittent bursts. It was humiliating, not just the lack of control, but the fact that this interloper just laid his hands on her!

What Cleo didn't know was that the hand placed over her left breast may have saved her life. Markus was actively rerouting the flow of current through her nerves away from the heart by. Good thing too, because he had vastly underestimated the concentration of ions in the atmosphere in such an altitude. In his early trials back at the orphanage, it was much milder. He could only imagine the utter misery Cleo was going through as her neural network is overloaded causing all of her voluntary and involuntary muscles to go haywire. The constant surge to her brain should have also interrupted her thoughts.

'Hopefully she won't die...'

Then again, someone would interfere if things got to that point. Markus had learned from his mistakes from the past. He could not show any mercy in a moderated duel. The last time he did that, he lost miserably.

With that in mind, Markus ramped up his attack and activated another set of spell circles, using the phial of sulphur in his satchel as the source. A mist of sulphuric acid formed around him, drenching the electrocuted girl. The distributed nature of the attack overwhelmed her attire's warding enchantments, and began eating into her clothes, hair, and skin, turning them a dirty yellow shade.

'This should be enough, right?' After a casual ten minutes, Markus pondered whether to stop the shock attack. He hadn't tried it on another human yet, so he didn't know if this was enough to incapacitate her. Furthermore, her appearance had also deteriorated drastically after her unceremonious acid bath. It really hurt Markus' conscience to watch her suffer like that.

Thus, Markus stopped the |Acid Mist| spell and targeted the makeshift blackpowder in his satchel. He activated a short burst of anti-gravity to reduce Cleo's weight and shoved her forward, causing a disconnect in the flow of current. Then, with a quick cast of |Explosion| he propelled her further.

Cleo flew through the air and landed like a ragdoll at the far end of the stage.

"Umm... Do I win?" Markus asked the dumbfounded referee. The man, in turn, gulped and looked at the wrecked body of the girl. He was given instructions to not stop the match even if anyone surrenders. So, after dabbing his sweating forehead, he said, "The combatant isn't incapacitated. The match will continue!"

"FUCK!" A hoarse voice bellowed, as
