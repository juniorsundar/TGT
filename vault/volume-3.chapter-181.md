Marek's feet twitched due to the stress building up inside him. It had been a long time since he poured his heart out like this. His previous experience, many years ago, had wounded him greatly and he was anxious to see how it would go this time.

He alternated his gaze between the table and Al's face. His conversation partner appeared distracted while gazing blankly into the wall. This simply worsened the turmoil in Marek's heart.

'Give me a reaction,' Marek pleaded. 'Anything at all!'

At that instant, Al suddenly raised his palm, brought it over his face, and started to shudder as a mirthful, muffled laughter resonated from him.

'That's...' Disappointing. Marek's heart ached once again. He wanted to dig a hundred feet deep hole and bury himself in it. He wanted the world to end right now, so that the past conversation would cease to exist. He wanted anything, absolutely anything, to save him from the humiliation he was feeling right now.

"I really can be stupid sometimes," Al commented. "The answer was right in front of me - it was literally squashed up against my nose - but I was too absorbed in my paranoia to grasp it."

"W-What-"

"I am flattered that you think of me that way," Al continued. "Honestly, I really am. But I am not looking to pursue a romantic relationship at the moment. As you so correctly pointed out, I am going through something. Let's call it a disaster of my own creation. And I hope to resolve that first before moving on to other ventures."

Based on Al's answer, Marek could see a faint glimmer of hope. "If that's the case, maybe I can help? After all, two heads ARE better than one."

"While I appreciate your offer, I won't accept it. I once included someone in pursuit of solving this problem, only to bring peril upon them. I cannot in good conscience inflict the same pain on another person," Al denied immediately.

Marek smiled bitterly, before sighing in relief. "Thank you for that, Al. I really mean it."

"Thank you? For what?"

"For your kind rejection," Marek answered. "I didn't know it, but there was a heavy load weighing down on my heart this entire time. 'Should I tell Al? How would he take it?' Those kinds of questions were eating away at me from the inside. Now that I've brought it out into the open, and received closure, I feel lighter all of a sudden."

"Why should you feel so apprehensive?" Al challenged. "Is it about the stigma?"

"Obviously! Like I said before, when I was still a budding mage, I grew attracted to a fellow Sect member. He was a kind-hearted lad who wouldn't think twice before helping others. Although he didn't make much headway in his cultivation, he was always willing to guide and trade pointers," Marek started with a nostalgic glaze in his eyes.

"Over time, my affection for him kept growing and growing. It reached a point where I couldn't contain it within myself. And so, I took a leap of fate and confessed. I thought he was... like me. The nature of our interactions made it appear as such. But he-" Marek flinched as he recollected the moment. "He put me out to dry. Let's say his rejection wasn't as dignified as yours. Ultimately, he let it slip and then everybody in the Sect knew - of the deviant named Marek Glista. I realised then that this world had no place for people such as myself. Thankfully I wasn't weakhearted. I could bear with the jeers and deriding comments. I worked my ass that day forth. And now, none who looked down on my remain alive. They either succumbed to the tests of time, or to my blades."

"What of that boy who betrayed your trust?"

"He killed himself," Marek answered flatly. "While it may sound morbid, his death was what helped me get over that whole debacle. When I found out that he killed himself, I realised that I wasn't the only one who held affection for the other in our friendship. He too reciprocated my feelings, but he was in denial of his own identity the entire time. He feared validating his feelings for me. It gave me comfort to know that I wasn't alone, but I was also a little dismayed that he chose that path."

Marek paused once he finished the anecdote and said, "But I am surprised that you aren't offended or repulsed by my expression of affection towards you."

"Why should I be offended, better you why should you feel anxious about it either ways?" Al retorted. "Who in their right mind would offend you"

Talk about why they're old casually.
