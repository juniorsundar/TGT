Marek and Al rushed towards the combat amphitheatre in the Outer Division hastily. Marek was embarrassed and outraged at the effrontery caused by the Sect Master's contemptuous "little princess". He was also extremely apologetic towards Al and his guests as the Sect's internal matters had bled over and affected them as well.

'If anything happens to my guests, Korr, let the Sect Master know that the price will be paid in blood. I will inflict the same hurt upon his precious little girl that she causes on the boy,' Marek warned Korr through |Mana Transmission|. The man did not flinch at the sudden threat, and maintained his facade concern and exhaustion.

Al was also worried. He knew that Markus had little experience in actual combat, and he also knew that his public loss against Gaige weighed heavily on him. Al was aware that sometimes, such experiences could turn into shadows that haunted a mage's heart turning into inner demons. He feared that another such public loss would worsen Markus' complex.

Within seconds, they had arrived at the stadium, but even before they got there, their mana sense had painted an awkward scene which caused them to slow their approach incrementally.

Their initial estimates and expectations were wholly shattered.

"What in the world?" Marek muttered as he observed Markus shower his opponent with a highly pressurised assault of sewage water which threatened to destroy the highly coveted Azurium Blade. Although the metal was known to be relatively brittle, it couldn't be so easily damaged. Which could only mean that the water jet had an extraordinary lethality.

Once Markus ceased the pressurised jet attack, his opponent, who looked nothing like Cleo Loras given her disheveled appearance and soiled and torn rags, was propelled outwards unceremoniously and came to a sliding halt a short distance away from the stage's borders.

Since Korr was the last to arrive, his internal snigger was shattered in its nacency and his usually unmoving face revealed a crack of surprise and horror. This wasn't what was planned. For a moment, he was even convinced that the other person on stage was probably not the Young Mistress. However, a scan around the amphitheatre confirmed that it WAS her!

"Elder Glista," Korr acted immediately. His mind ran the scenarios and he realised that the sequence hadn't changed. Elder Glista still had to lower the formation, albeit it was more important than ever now!

"No, no," Marek said with a light chuckle. "I'm interested in seeing how this goes."

"But Elder-"

"She was the one who wanted it activated, aren't I right?" Marek jabbed. "Actions have consequences. She's been skirting around those consequences for a while now. I believe this will be a valuable experience for the little princess."

"Elder, please," Korr begged with sweat dripping down his forehead. It was real this time, not an act, and Marek was enjoying every minute of it.

"Something's wrong," Al interjected. "Markus isn't usually this aggressive."

"That's because that little miscreant went ahead and activated the Irrationality Formation in her favour," Marek answered.

"Elder!" Korr immediately called out, only to receive a forceful glare and a suppressed growl from Marek. The reason for his reminder was because technically, the Irrationality Formation hidden in the bundle was a cheat. The formation tilted the duels in favour of one side, which was against the fairness expected from a duel in the first place. If others heard of this, it would dent the Sect's reputation greatly.

At that instant, Marek and everyone else felt a fluctuation around them.
