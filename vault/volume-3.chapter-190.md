"So, what did you find through your meditation?" Al inquired. He and Guy were standing facing each other on the impromptu sparring area.

"I'm going to do it now. But I will need you to do a few things for me to test some stuff out," Guy answered as he extended his arms to his side, with open palms facing towards the sky. He closed his eyes and started to call out the mana from his core and directed it out his palms.

A translucent mist started to emanate from Guy's hands, like a humidifier. Interestingly, instead of diffusing into the atmosphere, it hung in place and spread outwards. Within minutes, a heavy mist enveloped the sparring field, fully encompassing Guy's entire mana domain.

"What does it feel like to you?" Guy inquired.

"It's definitely not water, or any kind of gas for that matter," Al answered. He extended his tongue outwards and licked the air. He then sniffed multiple times and narrowed his eyes. "Has no taste or smell."

"It's mana," Al responded after observing the area with his mana sense. Suddenly, his eyes widened in shock. "The mana is tethered to the atmospheric mana. This is interesting it isn't displacing it at all!"

"Teacher Jeeves," Markus called out from the side. "What does that signify?"

"Generally, when a mage exudes mana from their core into the atmosphere it generally displaces the existing mana. This is also one of the ways to take full control of your mana domain, although it is extremely inefficient. Usually, mages prefer to recruit the atmospheric mana with spells, just like how Cleo did during your fight."

"That being said, although your Master is releasing the mana from his core into the environment, it is not actually displacing the existing mana. Instead, his mana seems to unify itself with the atmospheric mana. This means that I can still use the atmospheric mana perfectly." Al waved his hand causing a small tornado to form in his palms.

"Not that it was an issue in the first place. With our cultivation realm gap, retaking control of the domain is trivial," he added as he dispersed the tornado.

"Although, this isn't the first time I've seen this method of mana dispersion. It is commonly used by assassins to gain control of their environment without letting their targets know of their presence," Al informed.

"Alright then, what's next?" Al asked Guy with anticipation oozing in his voice.
