"According to Master, the name of a Sect matters a lot," Marie said offhandedly. "Are you sure that you want us to do it?"

"Ultimately, the Sect will service you folk," Guy shrugged. "Who better to bestow it its name than those that will comprise it?"

Guy observed a complicated expression spawn across everyone's face. He could see that they were struggling with it. It was understandable. After all, he was putting them on the spot with this request. No one could spawn creativity on demand, unless they were Kano of course. That boy was a well of creativity that seemingly never ran dry. He could create seasons that didn't exist, sceneries that were beyond mythical, beasts that hadn't been envisioned before, and he could evoke emotions that couldn't be put into words. Guy was tempted to take Kano's input in this, but he figured that there were still a few more years left until the Sect became relevant to Kano. Who could predict if Kano would even be interested in joining the Sect at that time? This is considering that the Sect existed at that time. All in all, it wasn't fair to do so.

"Let's follow this strategy," Guy declared as he clapped his hands. "We will spend ten minutes, brainstorming ideas. Each person will come up with one name, and why they chose that it. They must present their honest opinions and profess their case. After that, the quorum will debate on the name. Whether it is viable. Whether it needs to be changed. And so on. Sound reasonable?"

The group hummed and proceeded with the activity. Right as they started, Marie noticed that Guy wasn't doing anything, "Aren't you participating as well, Teacher?"

"I came up with a few names earlier. I didn't like them," Guy confessed while shaking his head.

"We could still debate on it," Marie offered.

"That's not necessary. I won't go with it even if you guys decide it. Those that contribute, have the right to veto their own works," Guy retorted smugly.

With that, all three of Guy's students regressed into contemplation. Each of their approaches to this was different, and unique befitting their personalities.

Marie was methodical. She promptly drew a table on a piece of paper and started to list out names off the top of her head followed by their pros and cons.

Jean was measured in her approach. It looked like she debated her ideas internally to a thorough level before her writing utensil pressed itself against the paper.

Markus, for better or worse, followed Guy's strategy of drawing a mind map and spawning off ideas based on key phrases and concepts. Although many sites and books promoted this method for brainstorming ideas, Guy admitted that it never really worked for him. All it did was complicate the matter further by amplifying the number of choices he had to filter between exponentially with each new branch. But this was all Guy's opinion, maybe it worked for others. Why else would organisation gurus push it so enthusiastically?

Guy kept time mentally, and to his surpise, the trio finished their first set of ideas well ahead of the ten minutes he set earlier.

"Who's going first?"

"Me," Marie volunteered. She walked up to the front of the class and prepared to speak when Guy quickly reminded her to jot down the name on the blackboard.

"The name I went for was 'Bright Horizons Sect'. I chose this name for two reasons. The first is to establish an optimistic and positive impression of the Sect. People that join this Sect can expect appreciative growth in the future. Secondly, the name can also act as an auspicious marker, indicating that the Sect will experience great success."

"Good job, Marie," Guy commended. He was proud of Marie's enthusiasm and readiness to put herself out there.

"Now, the floor is open for your opinions. Please keep it civil and constructive," Guy said.

"I think it's a nice name," Jean opined. "It presents a possible vision of the Sect, for both its members and itself."

"I also agree," Markus chimed in. "But I also feel like the name is a bit open-ended and vague."

"Can you expand on that Markus?" Guy volleyed.

"The name does not explore the present nature of the Sect. It professes what the Sect could be and achieve. But it does not portray what members can expect from the Sect in the present. I think we should try to include details along those lines as well."
