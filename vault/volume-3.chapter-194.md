"Teacher Larks, you didn't have to come all the way here," Karmin greeted jollily while reaching forward for a fulfilled hug.

As Guy embraced the man in return, he noticed a few changes in his demeanour. For one, Karmin appeared much, much stress-free as opposed to the last time. It was also evident that he had gained a little weight and his face had gained more colour.

'It looks like business is good,' Guy though to himself. If only he checked his bank account first, he would realise just how much of an understatement that comment was. The Burning Forge was raking in an ungodly amount of money. After people realised the ubiquity and base strength of steel, they started to adopt it everywhere. Mercenary corps, sects, clans, businesses, heck even the Royal Family placed orders for steel weapons and armours, both enchanted and regular.

It got so out of hand that Karmin was forced to loosen the restrictions on purchase and sale of the alloy, which was preceded by an extremely heated negotiation with the Head of the Smithing and Enchanting Guild. Although a few concessions were made, there were no substantial losses. The Burning Forge, and Guy, still held the patents for the alloy and would receive a percent share from every unit mass of steel sold through the Guild and its channels. The guild and its members could sell steel as ingots and as forged weapons and armours, but enchanting was only allowed through The Burning Forge's stamp.

Thanks to these events, Guy's account had ballooned significantly, and the bank had taken the initiative to upgrade his status to VVIP. Of course, Guy did not know of this yet since his registered address was expired and they could not correspond with him.

"Since it was I who needed a favour, it was only right that I approach you. Besides that, I don't qualify for the 'Teacher' title. You can just call me Guy," Guy said while waving his hands.

"If that is what you prefer, then let's be casual. I believe we've earned this given our business entanglements. You can be comfortable with me and call me Karmin," the man responded jovially and gestured for Guy to take a seat. They were currently in The Burning Forge's office in Radiant City. Guy travelled to the commerce hub of the Maika Duchy to accomplish many things in preparation of setting up his Sect. One of which would require the involvement of a backer with a wide sales channel, an established and substantial business, and an open-mind with the willingess to take risks.

"I received your mail earlier, it indicated that you wanted to discuss something?" Karmin directed the conversation. After getting to know Guy, he understood that just like himself, the man wasn't a fan of useless small talk.

"That is true. Before I get to that, though, I would like to talk about a few prerequisite details that support my request," Guy responded and proceeded to explain his goal of starting a Sect.

Now that Guy had a name for his Sect as well as a location where it could be established, he started to move down the checklist and addressed the next order of business which was income. A sect needed money to sustain itself. Escort missions were a sect's bread and butter, but those were hard to come by since most businesses preferred established sects over hedging their bets on fledgelings. Those that did commission new and less renowned sects wouldn't be able to pay as much. So Guy was sure that his sect wouldn't be able to recoup its expenses by relying only on escort missions. Furthermore, those were often dangerous and he wasn't sure if his students were strong enough to handle them so soon.

An alternative that did not involve underage kids putting their lives on the line was through conducting business. This could involve providing a specialised service or selling unique products.

To that end, Guy found through research that there were exceedingly complex steps involved in starting a business affiliated with a Sect. Especially within the Solar Empire, where the market was heavily controlled, there were a plethora of requirements that needed to be fulfilled. First, he would have to start a company under the Sect's name which could only sell within one specific town or city. Once the company achieved a market dependent revenue quota, they would have authorisation to start trade and sell in other towns and cities. Of course, there were ways to circumvent through back channels and connections, both of which Guy lacked.

The more feasible option would be to partner with an already established business and piggy-back of their sales channels. Thus Guy decided to bank on his connection with Karmin.

"I see," Karmin hummed once Guy finished speaking. "So I am guessing that your request has something to do with your Sect's possible revenue stream?"

"That is correct," Guy affirmed.

"So?" Karmin inquired as he leaned into his table.

Guy smiled and reached into his bag, retrieving a half-inch thick, A4 sized, bound stack of papers and placed it in front of Karmin.

"What's this?" Karmin asked with furrowed brows as he pulled the stack towards himself.

"The business proposal," Guy explained.
