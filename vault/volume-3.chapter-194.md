The class was dismissed and everyone went their way, except for Jean who remained in place for a while, silently chewing on her lips with a faint conflicted expression flashing forming on her face.

'Maybe another time?' She concluded unassuredly. Seemingly, Sect Leader Larks had forgotten about the appointed discussion amidst the hectic naming debate. She wanted to remind him once again, but held back her tongue at the last minute because she was worried. Fear was brewing inside of her.

#Pathetic wimp!#

*Stop agitating her!*

#Shut up!#

Jean shook her head to silence the voices assaulting her mind. She exhaled a troubled breath and lamented silently. She'd taken a large step forward, but things were starting to regress. She was scared, but she didn't know how to bring it up in front of Sect Leader Larks. She empathised with his decision to create a Sect, but she also didn't want to disappoint him by being a hindrance.

'What do I do?' She sighed. Amidst her anguish, the voices started to pick up steam once again. She had to spend a greater portion of her consciousness to appease them both. As she did so, she entered a preoccupied trance and her body ran on autopilot. She walked, and walked, and walked onwards, uncaring of where her feet took her. She continued moving at a steady and mechanical pace, until suddenly, a myriad of familiar fragrances assaulted her senses.

Unwittingly, through some form of subconscious muscle memory, she found herself in the garden Grace tended to by the spring.

Jean bent down and inspected the flowers blooming in a systematic grid with a gentle touch. Everything was in perfect order, growing as well as they could, given the limitations Grace had to work with.

"You're in late?" Grace's voice commented from behind her. Jean jolted her neck and addressed the garden's owner and caretaker with as sincere of a smile her face could muster. Jean acknowledged Grace's question with pursed lips and an inattentive nod. It was close to sunset - Jean didn't usually visit the gardens during this part of the day. Usually, Jean frequented the gardens early in the morning.

"If you're here now, it means something's bothering you," Grace deduced accurately. Once again, Jean was completely floored. There weren't that many people in this would who could read her so easily like a book, especially after her treatment. In fact, she could count the number of people with just one hand- no- just two fingers. The first, of course, was her teacher, Sect Leader Larks. The second, surprisingly, was Matron Reva.

Grace noticed Jean's eyes faltering and her lips moving up and down. Whatever the girl was struggling with, was something she found difficult to vocalise. No matter, "Help me survey the garden first. Tell me what's on your mind after. Okay?"

Jean nodded and moved to assist Grace as they transitioned from one plant to the other. Something Jean learned through her interaction with Grace was that the woman was uncannily learned in botany for both mundane and magically charged plants. There were a few plants in the garden like the Bluegleam Fungus, which required highly specific mana dense and damp environments to grow, which were suprisingly thriving. Jean knew for a fact that it was difficult to grow these without one being a mage themselves and having access to extremely specific soil conditions. But Grace had ingeniously used the nature of other plants growing in its vicinity to her advantage. The fungi were cultivated in an indentation of a tree with Sweltering Moss growing around it, which is known to agitate the plants it grows on and discharges the water stored within them to create an extremely humid ambience. The tree was also host to the notorious Sanguineous Creeper, which is known to consume blood to generate highly potent mana which can be stored within its vines for an extremely long period of time. None of these were naturally found in this part of the forest, which meant that Grace had transplanted them in here. To be able to then maintain these plants in such bounteous condition without being a mage definitely raised Jean's respect for the woman.

"That's the last of it!" Grace declared with a satisfied grunt while clapping her hands to dislodge an much dirt as possible. "Come, let's wash our hands. Dora made some soap with a sandalwood infusion. I don't know how Guy got his hands on such expensive materials, but damn is it worth it!"

Grace waved a soap bar which she retrieved from her satchel hanging over her shoulders and called Jean over to the spring.

"Hmmmm! Smells divine," Grace commended while taking a deep breath from her cupped hands as the duo walked back to the orphanage.

"Now, tell me. What's eating at you?" Grace asked casually.

"I'm just feeling worried," Jean answered without hesitation. After settling her apprehension through the mundaneness of tending the plants, her mind was sufficiently unburdened and open to sharing.
