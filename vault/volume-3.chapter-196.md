Karmin had to physically hold himself back from hugging the man in front of him and kissing him on the lips. As a businessman, Karmin quickly envisioned the possibilities professed by the device presented in front of him. Using his knowledge of blacksmithing, he could confirm that what was proposed was within the limits of reality and was possible to materialise.

Guy noticed that Karmin was on the cusp of tipping over in favour of the investment and decided it was time for the coup-de-grace.

"This device is a trailer of what my business aims to output. Machines and solutions that can simplify overlooked problems that prevail in society. Let us take a step back and look forward in time. A decade later, more than 25% of publishers in the world utilise this Press to produce their books. With the ease of manufacture and distribution, more and more people have access to information and the average literacy of the population increases. Those of the lower class that believed they could never escape their station due to the educational barrier blocking their advance no longer have to worry about their illiteracy, since just about anyone can learn to read and write with a small expense of a few copper coins to purchase a book that teaches them how to read."

"Why would you buy a book to learn to read?" Karmin blurted out.

"Pictures," Guy answered. "See! This opens up a new avenue altogether. Books that teach people to do things. A century into the future, just about anyone can write and publish a book. A farmer could write a book teaching others how to tend to different crops. An adventurer could write a book teaching others of the fundamentals to survive in the wilderness."

"Solutions that can change the future," Guy highlighted. "You can expect more of those from the company."

Karmin nodded subconsciously, but his mind was already dwelling into the future as Guy indicated. Except, he wasn't envisioning all those philanthropic outcomes, he was mentally counting the gold coins spilling into his coffers.

"This... Okay!" Karmin declared. "You've convinced me. I am prepared to invest in this company."

"Wonderful! Now comes the often unpleasant part of this interaction: the negotiation," Guy said as his enthusiasm dampened. "I have prepared a preliminary contract to cement our agreement. Please have a read and if you have any problems, we can flesh out the details further."

Guy produced another stack of papers, much thicker than the proposal, and plopped them in front of Karmin. As he read them, Karmin's expression turned complicated, not because he had issue with the contents, but rather the content was extremely thorough and tackled every question he could think of.

"The Burning Forge will be responsible for manufacturing and distribution. The Burning Forge will also act as the point of sales for the first ten years following the validation of this contract. Clients may place orders from any Burning Forge outlet. Verum Trading Company will be responsible for marketing, sales, design and development, and the products will be owned, on paper, by the company."

"..."

"As an investor, Karmin Zola will receive earnings equivalent to the percentage invested."

"..."

"Every new product developed by Verum Trading Company that is to be manufactured and distributed through The Burning Forge will be subject to another contract that will determine the cost of goods, resources, and so on. For the first ten years, The Burning Forge will be the sole manufacturer and distributor for Verum Trading Company, following which another contract negotiation will take place."

"..."

"The stake for Verum will be held by Karmin Zola till their termination. It is non-transferable. If Karmin Zola wishes to transfer the stake to a third-party, the recipient must be able to purchase the stake according to its price, which corresponds to the percentage invested given the valuation of the company at that point in time."

"..."

Karmin dabbed the sweat from his forehead as he averted his eyes from the stack of text. He still had a quarter of the stack left. He had seen many a contracts in his lifetime, this was by far the most... everything!

"This is quite verbose," Karmin commented.

"If we're doing this, we're going to do this right. I respect your business acumen, and I don't intend to waste your time," Guy responded with a resolute expression. "I h"
