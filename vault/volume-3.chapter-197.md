Markus was in a perpetual state of heightened awareness and anxiousness.

"Can I get you anything, Sir?" A courteous feminine voice caused him to jolt in place. He turned to face the smiling facade of an objectively beautiful woman, garbed in a conservative yet elegant pastel-red robe. Her face was painted to accentuate her sharp features, and was made to look as natural as possible. Markus figured that was the theme they were going for, sincerity. Even the woman's smile looked real, her eyes were lax with folds forming by their sides complementing her slight smile.

"I-I- No, thank you," Markus answered, swallowing an audible gulp. As he observed the woman recede out the room and slide the door close without turning her back to him, he violently tapped his belt satchel and sighed in relief after confirming something.

Markus wasn't used to being treated this way, with such deference. Especially given where he was right now.

During his time at the Academy, Markus had heard of a legendary restaurant in the entertainment district. In fact, he heard that it was a restaurant in name only and that in reality it was just as grand as the Emperor's palace. Markus never got the opportunity to verify these rumours at that time, given how he had more pressing issues to contend with. So he was shocked when his Master instructed him to book a private table for Sect business. At first he was apprehensive, he was sure that booking reservations in a restaurant most compared to the monarch's palace would be far from trivial. Before he could voice that thought, his Master plopped a luminescent bank account token in his palm. He then instructed Markus to visit the bank and withdraw some funds to "expedite" the reservation.

It was when Markus pursued that side-task that the second bombshell collapsed on him. The moment he entered the bank and displayed the token, he was dragged inside by a small squadron of powerful mages who proceeded to interrogate him on how he got his hands on the token. After a rather charged inquiry, the bank performed a complete one-eighty. He was whisked out from a dreary prison-like setting to a luxurious lounge being waited on by an armada of servants and a butler ready to bring him anything he requested while they verified his transaction.

During his wait, Markus finally understood that his Master hadn't been jesting when he repeatedly warned him about his wealth. His Master was loaded! Legitimately loaded! Markus hadn't seen that many zeroes after a number in his entire life!

He exited the bank with a small pouch filled with gold coins hidden in his satchel. The mere presence of that hot potato raised his anxiety levels to the max. Markus would intermittently tap his satchel to make sure that the coins remained there, unaware that his skittering behaviour had attracted the eyes of actual pickpockets. But before they could make their move, Markus turned a corner and arrived in front of The Golden Plate, the premier eatery in all of Radiant City, and possible the Solar Empire. No one wanted to get caught in these neck of the woods.

Markus was so absorbed in protecting his booty that he failed to enjoy the visual before him. The Golden Plate was a marvel of modern architecture. By using marble to create intricately carved designs that evoked an imperious aura of exclusivity and wealth; it was the epitome of luxuriance. The restaurant was tall, seven storeys tall, and had balconies extending out from each floor which, if observed from above, gave the building an appearance of a blooming lily.

The first person to greet Markus was a man with an extremely warm smile.
