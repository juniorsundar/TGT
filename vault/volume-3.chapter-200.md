"This is fantastic," Garlin praised while pointing at the varied instances of graphs peppered accross the report. "It so accurately encasulates everything I want to know, without me having to sit down and deconstruct pages upon pages of unintelligible text and numbers."

"What are these images?" He added while glancing between a pie, bar and line graph conveying three different sets of data.

"They're called graphs. As you so rightly said, they are pictorial representations of data," Guy affirmed.

"Wonderful! Did you invent these graphs?" Garlin responded, but then he caught himself and bit his tongue. "Apologies, I understand if these are trade-secrets of some kind."

Guy waved his hand casually and said, "To answer your first question, I wasn't the one who invented them. I do teach about them, though."

Garlin noticed Markus nodding along and asked the boy, "You know how to make these things?"

"Master has taught us how to collect, process and present data in human-readable format, yes," Markus answered. "Graphs and charts are included in this."

Garlin pushed out his lower lips and nodded with and impressed expression. His eyes darted to his son who was also perusing through the report, reading the pages he had already finished. A thought sprouted in his mind at that instant, but Garlin didn't actively pursue it for the time being. After a short half-minute, he quickly reverted to the situation at hand.

"This Verum Trading Company, you intend to use it to finance the True World Sect which you will be leading," Garlin confirmed.

Upon receiving a nod from Guy he followed up, "To that end, I have a few questions regarding your Sect, since the two will be inevitably tied together."

"Go ahead," Guy agreed.

"I am sufficiently informed of the requirements to starting and maintaining a Sect," Garlin started. "How can you guarantee that the Solar Alliance will validate the creation of your Sect?"

"We have the support of a Tesseract Transformation realm mage," Guy declared openly.

Garlin's eyes nearly popped out of his sockets, and his son who was gulping down a glass of water took a legitimate spit-take.

"A T-T..." Garlin stuttered. "Tesseract Transformation? H-HOW? WHO?"

"I believe it would be in our best interest to not agitate them. Though I can provide guarantees of their support. If need be I can add it to the contract."

"Contract?"

"Right!" Guy snapped his finger and retrieved the second monstrous paper pile from his satchel and dropped it before Garlin. "These documents are for our potential partnership in this venture. If you are interested in investing and holding a stake in this business, there are additional clauses," Guy added while sliding forward another set of documents.

Compared to Karmin's response, Garlin's eyes sparkled with excitement. He rubbed his hands in anticipation, licked his right thumb in preparation of some aggressive page flipping. Guy swore that he saw the man salivating as he mouthed the clauses.

"Oh ho! Smart, smart, I would have missed that," the man commented with a sly chuckle. Every now and then, the man released a similar comment in contemplation or in commendation followed by a sound ranging between a thoughtful hum to a full-blown laugh.

"Beautiful!" The man concluded as he finished reading the final clause. "I could not find a single lapse or exploitable clause. Every aspect I could think of was addressed and then some. Truly a magnificient contract, this one is. Did you write this, or was a third-pary consulted?"

"I wrote it, thank you for your kind words," Guy replied with a wry grin. He wasn't completely used to receiving compliments, especially if what he was getting it for wasn't something he was expressly good at. Guy had seen better contracts penned down in his past life, but people far more educated in the field than he was. This barely scratched the surface - Guy was sure that if a more ruthless capitalist with a top-notch legal team were to approach this self-admittedly haphazard contract, they could drill holes into it like a worm devouring a tasty fruit.
