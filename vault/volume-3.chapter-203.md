"Yes... this looks good," Krish muttered as he tapped at a specific location of his cottage wall. He then moved frantically to another location and did the same, "Yes... yes... good."

He moved from one and to the other, inspected the floor, the walls and even the ceiling by levitating above the ground at a stable height. This was what Marie observed when she entered the cottage to confer with her Master on this particular day.

"Umm... Master?" Marie announced, expressing her bewilderment through her rising tone. "What are you doing?"

"Setting up the ritual formation. Close the door and sit there! Don't disturb me," he instructed as he resumed his seemingly aimless inspection.

"What is this ritual formation about?" Marie inquired as she assumed a cross-legged, seated position on her Master's cot.

"It's in preparation of our next step- Ah shit! Can you stop interrupting me?!" Krish yelped in frustration. He grumbled under his breath as he redid his previous check.

"Why are you being so fussy? Aren't you in the Tesseract Transformation realm? Can't you inspect all of it at once with your mana sense or something?" Marie mocked.

"This girl- You have no idea of the kind of powers we're dealing with. If what we're about to do in here gets out into the world..." Krish shuddered visibly at the thought.

Marie squinted suspiciously at Krish and stuck out her tongue in challenge. Krish noticed her movement and scoffed loudly, "Stop distracting me!"

"Fine, fine..." Marie muttered as she lay on her back and napped - or at least she tried to. Her curiousity wouldn't allow her to relax just yet - it didn't help that her Master extremely vocal the entire time, confirming things out loud and constantly humming in contemplation. This went on for some time, pushing Marie to her breaking point, until finally a satisfied, "Done!" yanked her into an upright seated stance.

"So what is all this about? I don't see or sense anything," Marie asked with agitation in her eyes.

"You know, nowadays, I don't see you the least bit worried about your cultivation," Krish redirected. "Markus and Jean both have achieved perfected resonance, the former advanced to Foundation Establishment while the latter stands at the cusp of breaking through. Do you not feel threatened or anxious at all?"

Marie shrugged and responded casually, "Well it's going to happen to me too, eventually, right? I am fated with The Heavenly Eye, after all."

Krish narrowed his eyes supiciously before releasing a mirthful snort, "I don't know whether it is a good or bad thing that you're starting to become more and more like me."

Marie's face froze in disbelief, "Damn it, I am, aren't I? When did this happen?"

"Its an unfortunate side-effect of future-sight, I'm afraid. When you know that things are about to happen, or have an idea that certain events will transpire, you tend to lose the motivation or urge to perform. It doesn't help that we have to constantly live on the edge, not knowing whether our actions will modulate the predetermined flow of events and come back to bite us," Krish explained.

"Does it only get worse? I mean, if I'm like this after learning Divination which only shows be the Transcients, what will happen to me after I can observe the Constants?" Marie probed worriedly.

"You will eventually start feeling detached from others," Krish answered honestly. "You may have already noticed it happening now. While in the beginning, you had the urge to help after forseeing negative events transpire, nowadays, you probably think twice about it. You question whether your interference is necessary or if it is better to just let them suffer through this one negative experience so that they can grow as people."

"That's... not good," Marie muttered.

"Ironic that the thing that you sought to keep your family safer is causing you to feel more detached from them," Krish commented.

"I won't let that happen," Marie responded resolutely. "I will never- NEVER- let that happen!"

Krish revealed a sly smirk and egged the girl further, "You don't know-"

"NEVER!" The cry was firm and unbending. It had the robustness of an Elder Tree capable of weathering the storms of time. Krish would have commended the girl, felt proud even for having such a strong-headed and bold Disciple. Yet, he could not do so. How could he, when her words were literally, once again, changing the flow of fate?!

'Troublesome,' he thought to himself. While he empathised with his dearest Disciple, the change she was attempting was too wild. She had no control over the waves of fate - proper control not just observing it as she was now. There would be unbound consequences to her actions, and he couldn't let that happen. Not yet. Not while he was still alive, anyways.

"Enough!" Krish boomed. His voice was a whisper, but it echoed accross the room - he had used both the wind and the mana to propagate it. "I was only messing around with you."

The girl's tenacious frown softened, before mellowing out completely. She shot a cautious look at Krish, before revealing a half-hearted smile. 

"In truth, I am a little antsy about my stagnant cultivation. There was little reference I could use to improve my cultivation without having to resort to trial and error, which I know that you expressly forbade," Marie confessed. "I guess I just trusted that you would tell me when it was my time."

"I appreciate that our relationship has reached that point," Krish said with a fulfilled smile. "In fact I was waiting for the right time. I did not want "
