"Yes... this looks good," Krish muttered as he tapped at a specific location of his cottage wall. He then moved frantically to another location and did the same, "Yes... yes... good."

He moved from one and to the other, inspected the floor, the walls and even the ceiling by levitating above the ground at a stable height. This was what Marie observed when she entered the cottage to confer with her Master on this particular day.

"Umm... Master?" Marie announced, expressing her bewilderment through her rising tone. "What are you doing?"

"It's in preparation of our next step- Ah shit! Can you stop interrupting me?!" Krish yelped in frustration. He grumbled under his breath as he redid his previous check.

"Why are you being so fussy? Aren't you in the Tesseract Transformation realm? Can't you inspect all of it at once with your mana sense or something?" Marie mocked.

"This girl- You have no idea of the kind of powers we're dealing with. If what we're about to do in here gets out into the world..." Krish shuddered visibly at the thought.
