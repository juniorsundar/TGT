"I will warn you, this is not going to be a pleasant feeling," Krish reminded Marie. "We will be forcefully changing your body to accomodate phenomena it should naturally be incapable of. Also, if you do not repeat the phrase exactly as I say it, the result may deviate drastically which in turn will cause you greater discomfort. So, once again, repeat the phrases exactly as I say them."

"I'm having second thoughts," Marie blurted out with a twitching smile.

"You either do it now, or at a later date," Krish reminded her.

"I choose later date!" Marie exclaimed.

Krish snorted playfully and said, "Stop putting it off. You're well-prepared for this."

"Am I?" Marie responded, displaying a rare instance of her vulnerability. Krish often forgot the girl was only fifteen-years-old.

'My goodness! We've only been together for a year?' Krish shuddered upon recollecting their unfathomable progress. Even in his youth, it took him three years to reach this point, and his Master would praise him as a prodigy who broke many records amongst the ancestors of the Heavenly Eye. Nonetheless, the tinge of jealousy that flashed in his thoughts was immediately drowned by an overwhelming sense of pride. 'This is my Disciple!'

"Nothing's going to go wrong as long as I am with you," Krish said with a low, reassuring voice. He then revealed a sly smile and added, "Do you realise just how difficult it was for me to find a Disciple? 1000 years - it took me an entire millenium to find you. So, do you think I will just let you slip through my fingers because of something so trivial?"

His words brought some levity and raised the wavering girl's confidence.

"Shall we being?" Krish reiterated. The girl exhaled loudly to clear her indecisiveness and nodded slightly in affirmation.

Without a moment of dalliance, Krish reactivated the formations embedded into his cottage walls and plunged himself and his Disciple into the upper dimension.
