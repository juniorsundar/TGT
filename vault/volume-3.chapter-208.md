Following the confrontation between Disciple and Master, a drastic shift in dynamic had transpired within the cottage - Marie had now taken charge of the matter of her own advancement.

"Let's break it down all the way to the basics," Marie commanded.

"This isn't necessary-"

Marie shot back with a stern glare that caused Krish to choke on his words. He could see that she wouldn't budge on this issue, not one bit.

"How do you mean?" Krish acquiesced with a sigh.

"Let me get this straight - correct me if I'm wrong," Marie prefaced. "In order to advance into Foundation Establishment, do I need to alter a Constant event, or experience the backlash from the Universe?"

Krish frowned contemplatively and asked, "Is there a difference?"

"Definitely!" Marie affirmed.

"How so? To my knowledge, altering a Constant elicits a backlash from the Universe. The two events are tied together," Krish rebutted.

Marie shook her head vehemently and stated her point, "I've been thinking about it a lot after I left yesterday. I remember learning something interesting during a lesson with Mister Larks. When it starts to rain heavily, with heavy storm clouds blotting the skies, you often observe lightning cracking frequently. What follows the flash of lightning is a loud boom of thunder. Kids who do not know what those two are can often make a false connection and presume that since thunder follows lightning every time, therefore thunder is caused by lightning. Do you believe that statement to be true?"

Krish shook his head lightly and said, "That's false. Thunder and lightning both occur simultaneously. They are a result of a singular event."

Marie snapped her finger and emphasised, "That's it! You see, what we have here is a common logical fallacy labelled |post hoc ergo propter hoc|."

"What is that?" Krish blurted out.

"Umm... Mister Larks said that it means 'after this, therefore because of this,' in Latin," Marie responded while scratching her head.

"Latin?"

"Mister Larks said that it's a dead language..."

Krish narrowed his eyes and commented, "I've never heard of such a language before."

Marie clicked her tongue in annoyance and said, "Does that matter right now? Please don't distract me Master."

Krish chuckled at his Disciple's stern warning and raised his hands in defeat.

"Basically, the phrase means that since event A occurred, then event B occurred, A is caused by B. Another example is that since the sun rises after a rooster crows, therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise."

"That's obviously incorrect," Krish confirmed.

"That's exactly my point. According to Mister Larks, almost everyone can fall victim to this fallacy if they do not maintain a healthy sense of criticism about what they see and observe every day. This is also a result of poor transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. Master, why do you believe that process of altering Constants and suffering a backlash have a cause-effect relationship? Is it because you have personally experimented with and evaluated the two phenomenon or is it because you took what your Master taught you and went along with it?"

Krish hummed as he reflected on his beliefs. As he formulated an answer to his Disciple's question, his eyes started to widen in shock.

"Are you saying that the Universe's backlash has nothing to do with altering a Constant?" Krish asked with an excited glint in his eyes.

"I don't know," Marie shrugged. "I haven't even observed a Constant with the Heavenly Eye, I cannot give you an answer to that question."

Although his elation was deflated, Krish was quick to grasp the implication of Marie's proposition. "If we can determine whether they hold a cause-effect relationship or not, we can then isolate the true condition needed to advance into Foundation Establishment realm. Am I right?"
