Although Guy enjoyed indulging his student's requests and teaching, he recognised the disrespect in the act of intruding into the territory of a Master and Disciple. Although this wasn't his first time aiding Marie in her cultivation, he didn't want this to become a regular event. After all, it was a bad sign if the Disciple of another approached him with all of her cultivation hang-ups. Therefore, the first thing he did after waking up was to approach Krish's cottage and get his permission.

However, before he could take a step out the orphanage, the answer he sought was delivered directly into his head. "You can go ahead and ease her troubles."

It was Krish's voice through transmission. Since Guy didn't have the same range, he had to speak out loud to seemingly no one in particular, like a mad-man.

"I don't know how to do it though. Again, I am not informed about the Heavenly Eye in any way whatsoever. Furthermore, I am aware that revealing any sensitive information can result in calamitious consequences. Are you sure that you want me to get involved in this?" Guy asked

"I trust Marie to differentiate between the knowledge that can and cannot be shared. She is a cautious and mature girl. She is just stuck right now and need some guidance to nudge her in a direction that can yield some form of result. It doesn't have to be successful, as long as she feels like she has achieved something meaningful."

Guy hummed in contemplation and inquired, "What exactly is she trying to do?"

"I will leave her to answer that question. You should prepare yourself, she is approaching you... Now!"

"Mister Larks!" Marie greeted from behind him.

"Marie, good morning."

"I don't know if its good just yet," Marie snorted. "Can we continue where we left off from yesterday?"

"I was waiting for you, after all," Guy said with a smile.

Guy ushered Marie into the classroom and urged her to explain her trouble coherently while utilising the blackboard to augment her retelling. He recollected from yesterday that there were multiple moving parts and details that were important which sort of rushed past him. And by the time Marie finished presenting her piece, two blackboards had been filled up with intricate diagrams, key phrases, propositions, hypotheses and rogue thoughts.

"That's where I'm stuck," Marie said with a defeated sigh. "I have no idea where to go with this. There is literally nothing I can do here!"

Marie's shoulder drooped with visible exhaustion, but it immediately perked up as her gaze gained a bright shimmer. She looked eagerly towards Guy. To her, Guy was akin to a great big bird who would swoop down and save her whenever she was stuck. Her tendency to rely on Guy had grown marginally within the last year, which was a good sign. It indicated that Marie was slowly letting go of the metaphorical weights that bore down on her shoulders. But it also put Guy in a difficult position, since he felt more and more pressured with each problem of hers as they grew in complexity. Maybe this was how parents felt as their kids grew older and the world moved forward while leaving them behind. Sometimes, Guy just didn't know what to do... If this were any other student of his, he would easily just tell them that he didn't know and guide them through possible research avenues. But when facing Marie's worshipping and admiring gaze, Guy just couldn't vocalise his ineptitude.

Guy scratched his chin as he scrambled for a feasible starting point - any detail he could grasp at and possible build upon.

"Just to confirm, as long as your observation of these 'Constants' is not through your Heavenly Eye, you will be safe? Have you confirmed that claim?"

"We have reason to believe so. I mean, there hasn't been a set precedent, but circumstances suggest that it may be the case," Marie reaffirmed. Guy could see that she was holding back some details, but he could figure out that they maybe secrets related to her cultivation method.

"Have you considered how other cultivators specialising in divination and future sight tune their powers?" Guy inquired.

"No I haven't," Marie answered with some uncertainty.

"Why is that? You were struggling to find resources. Well, what about them?"

"They aren't as accurate as the Heavenly Eye," Marie argued.

"But they work, don't they?" Guy argued back. "Even if the margin of error with them is greater, they offer a solution - something you sorely need."

Marie's lips parted and as she failed to come up with a response. In truth, this idea did pass her mind before but she didn't go through with it because-

"Arrogance," Guy declared. "Every piece of knowledge which is sufficiently substantiated has truth to it."

"You're right," Marie accepted with a defeated smiled. "I was being conceited."

"Your Master is probably to blame," Guy blurted out, only to receive a sarcastic scoff directly transmitted into his head. He bit his tongue apologetically. "The people you worry about competing against - those that have lived for millenia each - they are all cut from the same cloth. They have the same prejudices and biases. The arrogance that was building up inside you probably accumulated inside them as well. What you have in those records your Master showed you is an echo-chamber in written format. Everyone is just accepting and repeating what others have written before them."

Guy leaned forward and said, "The first step to solving the puzzle in front of you is, like always, accumulating more perspectives even if it isn't optimal. Since I have a week or so of free time before the builders get here, we shall conduct the research work together."

Marie nodded appreciatively, but then her gaze mellowed, "I don't think Master has any cultivation manuals of other divination or farsight based cultivation paths."

To that, Guy revealed a proud smirk and said, "That's not an issue. I remember reading through a bunch of them back in the Academy. I just have to transcribe them."

"You remember them by heart?" Marie exclaimed in shock.

Guy tapped the side of his head and spoke mysteriously, "My head is a steel trap, once I read a book I never forget it. There is literally a Repository of Knowledge in there."
