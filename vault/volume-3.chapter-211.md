Marie narrowed her eyes and gave her Master an affronted look.

"Why are you doing this, Master?" She blurted out exasperatedly.

"Doing what?"

Marie pointed downwards aggressively and waved her hands around her right after as she repeated, "This! A week. I spent an entire week coming up with a solution, even an inkling of it, and finally gained some headway. But then you stumble along and just slap it away?"

"I'm just trying to help..." Krish muttered. "Isn't it better to not have to go through a pointless path that leads to a dead end."

Unbridled rage flashed across Marie's eyes, which started to radiate outwards, "How do you know it will be a dead end? Have you tried exploring it?"

"Well not personally," Krish shrugged. "My Master's Master did, though. I heard from my Master that it was a wasted effort. His Master spent five years trying to find a viable connection between the contemporary seer arts and the Heavenly Eye."

"So its hearsay?" Marie reiterated.

"It's not hearsay," her Master said with a stern retort. "I heard it from my Master, who learned from his."

"Yet there are no written records of this experiment," Marie pointed out. "What were the testing criteria, what was the methodology? Without answering these questions, and evaluating the evidence, how can I just trust this claim?"

"I am your Master," Krish warned.

"And I am your Disciple, you should know the kind of person I am," Marie shot back with equal ferocity. "And here I thought we were getting closer," she muttered disappointedly.

Krish sighed audible and inquired, "I was only trying to help. I just..."

In truth, Krish was feeling left out. For the past few weeks, due to Guy's absence, he got to spend more time with his Disciple and perform his duties as a Master more extensively. He even got the opportunity to teach his Disciple some spells and magical theory. Although he was the one who preempted Guy's trip for his student's sake, he felt a little jealous after observing the two working together so cohesively. He could see that the two shared the same wavelength, something he'd been trying to achieve with his Disciple through excruciating amount of effort. Now that he thought about it, Guy had this uncanny ability to connect with any child taught. The man could shift his approach like a chameleon - it was a skill Krish sorely desired nowadays.

"This isn't helping," Marie responded solemnly, noticing the drop in her Master's expression. She wasn't an expert in reading body language and intent, but she could at least glean that her Master's current demeanour had more to do with himself than with her. He was being petty, completely unlike himself.

"Besides," Marie added. "It's decided! Even if your Master's Master failed, I won't. I will MAKE SURE that I succeed, even if it is the last thing I do."

"But how?" Krish asked.

"We'll find a way," she answered. "We managed to come this far, let's see how much further we can go."

With that said, Marie skipped towards the blackboards and started to jot down hypotheses as they popped into her head. Her mind was whirring constantly, forming connections and disconnecting pointless avenues at inhuman speeds. At a point, her hands could not keep up with her thoughts, and they started to visibly stutter in place.

As Marie worked on the boards, Krish approached Guy and asked with a low whisper, "How do you do it?"

"Do what?" What Guy's knee-jerk response as he remained distracted by the convoluted mess being manifested on the board.

"Mesh with her so easily? I am yet to observe a single adversarial interaction between you and Marie. In fact, I am yet to observe such an interaction between you and ANY of your students," Krish inquired with a hesitating and ashamed tone.

"The answer is right in front of you," Guy pointed out. "Marie is driven and intelligent when approaching topics she is informed about, and she is humble and deferring when it comes to topics she isn't so knowledgeable about. All you need to do is show her a path, and she will explore it to its entirety. What you did earlier was place a blockage in her path. In doing so, you intruded into her natural process and pushed her to do the exact opposite - since it is in her nature to be a contrarian."

"Okay, I'm stuck again," Marie declared as she stepped back with a pensieve look.

Guy mouthed, 'See what I mean?' to Krish as he approached his struggling student. "Where's the issue now?"

"It all feels like a cohesive system," Marie commented. "The other cultivation methods use astrological positions as some sort of initial conditions that can be used to predict the state of the system in the future. However, what if there is an error in the initial state estimate? Is this why the other methods are inaccurate?"

As Guy absorbed Marie's words, an idea started to bloom in his mind. The whole explanation and her diagrammatic representation on the blackboard started to tug at a long forgotten memory of his from his past life. He'd read of something like this before.
